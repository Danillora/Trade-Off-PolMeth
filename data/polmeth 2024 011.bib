Abstract = {The article connects the much discussed recent political developments in
   Hungary under Viktor Orban with the dynamics between depoliticization
   and politicization guiding the local reception of Carl Schmitt's works.
   Recent developments in Hungarian politics have been widely researched,
   but mostly without giving due attention to political thinking. The
   article argues that the reception of Schmitt's works, both in academia
   and in public discourse, has significantly influenced political thinking
   in Hungary throughout the 20(th) century and in recent decades. By
   reading the history of reception, the article aims to confirm that
   depoliticization and politicization are not diametrically opposed in the
   sense that the former stands for the elimination of politics. Rather,
   depoliticization and politicization follow from each other, as Schmitt
   himself described the impossibility of neutralizing politics. Beginning
   with the 1920s, this article examines three periods of Schmitt's
   reception and shows that, after attempts of depoliticization, Schmitt
   was increasingly acknowledged as an author who argues for an overtly
   politicized account of politics. In terms of political thinking, this
   last development has defined the context of Hungarian politics since the
   2010s.},

Abstract = {This article assesses, a few months after the Meloni government's
   inauguration, the extent to which the new executive has as compared to
   its predecessors, been an executive of change. The significant shifts
   that had taken place in the political landscape gave rise to
   expectations of considerable innovation. The Meloni government is the
   first led by a woman; it marks the return of a centre-right majority
   coalition to power, and it operates within a parliament that is smaller
   due to the 2020 constitutional reform that reduced the number of
   deputies and senators. In light of these factors, we examine whether the
   Government's actions are different compared to its predecessors based on
   the Prime Minister's profile and the political and technical
   qualifications of ministers. We test our expectations by analysing the
   Government's legislative activity, particularly focusing on the 2024
   budget. However, the findings fail to support our expectations for the
   period under investigation, as long-term trends prevailed.},

Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The past two decades have seen increasing mentions of health equity and
   the importance of addressing the social determinants of health in USA
   public health statements. Yet, there is little uptake of these concepts
   into USA public policy. We see this, in part, as being due to the
   unwillingness of the USA public health community - including its network
   of Masters of Public Health Programs - to address the fundamental cause
   of health inequities: the United States' capitalist economic system
   which skews the distribution of the social determinants of health in
   favour of the wealthy and powerful. We illustrate this reluctance by
   examining how the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins
   University conceptualises the promotion of health equity through its
   International Declaration of Health Rights. Nothing in the Declaration
   considers how the economic system threatens health yet it is presented
   as a model for public health education. We review its shortcomings and
   show how revision to it is unlikely since the School is endowed by its
   namesake billionaire Michael Bloomberg who has denounced any attempts at
   redistributing wealth and income in the service of public health.
   Evidence of how public health messaging is already shaped by powerful
   economic interests embedded within the United States' capitalist system
   substantiates concerns that have been raised about such branding and its
   effects on public health discourse and action.},

Abstract = {The use of innovation rhetoric by non-tech individuals reinforces their
   personal branding. Studying four non-tech political personalities, this
   study provides evidence of how and why non-tech politicians are trying
   to present themselves as tech-savvy. As the article describes,
   innovation buzzwords, stories, narratives, and metaphors add value to
   any non-tech brand, enhancing promotional presence and marketing
   effectiveness. It is apparent from the findings that innovation rhetoric
   has the aim of creating a positive public image, which contributes to
   the public perception of an individual.},

Abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic pushed the European
   Union (EU) to centralize several public health functions. With the
   European Health Union (EHU) initiative, four reforms have been adopted
   to strengthen the EU's health security framework: the extension of the
   European Medicines Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention
   and Control's mandates, the creation of the Health Emergency
   Preparedness and Response Authority, and the upgrading of the Decision
   on serious cross-border threats to health. This article analyses the
   reconfiguration of authority patterns resulting from these reforms. It
   argues that the EHU exemplifies a distinct mode of integration
   (expansive unification) in which national sovereignty is not transferred
   to the center but is jointly exercised at the center. This mode of
   integration is suitable for capacity building in core state domains when
   functional needs confront reluctance from constituent units to surrender
   control.},

Abstract = {This commentary examines the changes and transitions in the Arab
   regional order in relation to the Arab-Israeli conflict since the
   foundation of the Israeli state. The discussion centers on four main
   transformations in the Arab regional order that occurred after major
   wars or confrontations with the Zionist regime. It also suggests that
   due to Operation al-Aqsa Flood, the conflict may enter a fifth phase. In
   addition, the analysis addresses the failure of the strategic decision
   made by the Arab states to only back a political settlement with Israel.
   It also argues that the American strategy to integrate Israel into the
   region and pursue a policy of normalization with its Arab allies was the
   main causality of the October 7 attacks. Finally, the discussion
   explores Israels' strategic losses that diminish its strategic value in
   the region.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to trace the origins of the caretaker convention.
   Most commentators look back no further than Sir Winston Churchill's
   caretaker government formed in the extraordinary circumstances that
   existed in the final days of World War II. The wartime coalition had
   broken up, leaving Churchill to form a new government, promising to act
   with restraint pending the first general election in Britain in nearly a
   decade. But the story neither begins nor ends there. Churchill's
   government was not the first to be called a `caretaker' government and
   even his caretaker government did not align with the modern concept.
   Searching for the first `caretaker' government reveals a complex
   interaction between the label and the convention that played out over a
   century from 1885 to 1987 and beyond. The full story also suggests there
   may be a deeper rationale for the caretaker convention than the need for
   restraint while a government is not responsible to Parliament-the need
   for restraint while a government has impaired legitimacy.},

Abstract = {This commentary argues that Hezbollah felt duty-bound to open a front in
   Southern Lebanon to ease Israel's military pressure on Hamas. Hezbollah
   indicated that its participation in the war will continue until reaching
   a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, apparently expecting the
   hostilities to last only for a few weeks. However, the war dragged on
   for months as Israel pledged to keep it going until destroying Hamas
   and, contrary to what Hezbollah expected, pushing it away from the
   border area to ensure the safety of its residents in the upper Galilee
   settlements. The fighting in Southern Lebanon turned into a war of
   attrition against Hezbollah as Israel eliminated most of its field
   commanders by drone attacks. Should Israel succeed in evicting Hezbollah
   from the border area, it would lose its claim to resistance to liberate
   Lebanese territory still occupied by Israel, increasing the pressure on
   it to disarm like all other Lebanese factions when the civil war ended
   in 1989.},

Abstract = {After being expelled from the Council of Europe, Russia passed a law on
   not complying with any judgment of the European Court of Human Rights
   that entered into force after 15 March 2022. In these circumstances, new
   approaches are required to safeguard the authority of the Court. This
   study considers the possible ways out of the deadlock. Firstly, it
   critically examines the Committee of Minister' strategy on implementing
   Russian judgments, which is limited to registering outstanding
   obligations of the Russian Government under the Court's judgments.
   Secondly, the frozen property in Europe is yet to be confiscated, nor it
   is clear whether it will be. This study proposes that, under the aegis
   and within a legal framework of an existing international organization,
   a trust fund be established which may receive voluntary contributions
   from States and individuals. It will be better placed to do so than
   multiple indigent individuals scattered across the globe. If and when
   Russia applies to return to the Council of Europe it may be required to
   reimburse, with all accrued interest, the amounts spent by such a trust
   fund.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the link between the economic diversification
   policies and regional investment strategies of Saudi Arabia and the
   United Arab Emirates, focusing on these countries' investment trends in
   Egypt as a case study. It explores how these investments serve as
   instruments of economic statecraft for Saudi and Emirati leaders,
   designed to bolster diversification objectives and address political,
   economic, and environmental risks. The findings uncover a notable
   increase in Saudi and Emirati investment in Egypt since the early 2000s.
   These investments not only prioritize sectors highlighted in their
   diversification blueprints, such as real estate, finance, and tourism
   but also extend into agricultural and renewable energy sectors, offering
   avenues to mitigate climate and environmental challenges. Ultimately,
   the study concludes that while these regional investments may support
   domestic diversification endeavors and promote economic integration
   within the region, they are also underpinned by the geo-economic agendas
   of Saudi and Emirati leaders, aiming to hedge against political and
   economic uncertainties.},

Abstract = {This article examines Russia's record in complying with the European
   Convention of Human Rights, the decisions of the European Court of Human
   Rights (ECtHR) and the CoE's policies in relation to the human rights of
   women - the protection of women from domestic violence in particular. It
   seeks to explain why Russia has systematically refused to introduce
   specialized legislation on protection from domestic violence. It argues
   that human rights of women, especially cases of domestic violence,
   became the main point of contention between Russia and the CoE for two
   main reasons: a fundamentally different approach to the human rights of
   women and equality, inherited from Soviet-era legislation; and a special
   type of legal reasoning of international legal obligations -
   conservative jurisprudence - which undermined the understanding of the
   legal value of protection of human rights of women and led to invoking
   various arguments of cultural sovereignty. Non-compliance and quiet
   avoidance of any gender -sensitive legislation, not least on domestic
   violenc e, indicate that Russia has never really committed to the rule

Abstract = {The Canadian child welfare system has been characterized as being in
   crisis for over a decade; the number of children in care (and dying in
   care) has increased dramatically, straining an overburdened system.
   Physical or sexual abuse is not the reason most children are removed
   from their homes; rather, the state deems them lacking the necessities
   of life, usually because their family is impoverished. Because the
   majority of children in care are Indigenous, the child welfare system is
   described as the new version of residential schools. Using the lens of
   historical institutionalism, this study argues that the current child
   welfare system reflects colonial and neoliberal assumptions that some
   parents are incapable of sound decision making by virtue of their race
   or socio-economic situation. Canada's child welfare system is both a
   product and contributor to the institutions and policies that reinforce
   intergenerational poverty, a key determinant of removing children from
   their families.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how the resources associated with the Temporary
   Assistance for Needy Families program, the Supplemental Nutrition
   Assistance Program, and the Unemployment Insurance program affect
   political participation. The research on policy feedback on mass publics
   has produce greater results relative to research on feedback and
   political participation. However, prior research has not disaggregated
   resource feedback effects thoroughly enough to decipher whether the
   monetary resources provided by a social welfare program are independent
   of the effects of the duration of receipt nor have they disaggregated
   the effects by race to estimate the racialized feedback effects. This is
   crucial because the primary questions surrounding the development of
   social welfare programs are: who should get it, how much they should
   get, and how long they should get it for. Research has also found that
   social welfare programs can produce disparate resource feedback effects,
   both encouraging and discouraging participatory behavior. To answer
   these questions, I utilize the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of
   Youth. I incorporate three comprehensive measures of social welfare
   receipt which allow the estimation of the effects over time. I find that
   the amount of aid received, and the duration of receipt are both
   significant factors in shaping participatory behavior but depending on
   the program I find heterogeneous effects. The disparate effects persist
   across social welfare programs and race.},

Abstract = {While political scientists have long studied citizens' political
   efficacy as an important indicator of attitudes toward government, less
   attention has been devoted to the efficacy of rural or urban residents,
   which is important given the intensifying rural-urban divide in American
   society. This study fills this gap by analyzing the 2020 American
   National Election Studies. Using ordered logistic regression, this study
   finds that (1) city residents tend to believe that small towns and rural
   areas have too much influence on government; (2) residents of small
   towns and rural areas demonstrate lower levels of external efficacy than
   city residents; and (3) people who believe that small towns and rural
   areas have too much influence tend to demonstrate high external and
   internal efficacies, a tendency that is clearer in cities than in other
   community types. These findings reflect mutual in-group bias and
   place-based resentment between rural and urban residents in American
   society.},

Abstract = {This article examined how social media content has shaped the
   representation of countries for publics around the world. Based on world
   system theory, the study investigated the underlying predictors of
   country mentions on X (formerly Twitter) in 2018. It confirmed that
   countries with greater economic power - or higher status in the world
   system - received more mentions. Furthermore, countries with larger
   populations were mentioned more frequently as were countries that
   experienced major conflicts. The findings from structural equation
   modeling shed new light on the interrelationships that drive the social
   media representation of individual countries and delineated an
   integrated Model of Country Mentions on X. These findings have
   implications for global leaders, policymakers, and social media firms.},

Abstract = {We develop State Legislative Effectiveness Scores (SLES) for state
   legislators across 97 legislative chambers over recent decades, based on
   the number of bills that they sponsor, how far those bills move through
   the lawmaking process, and their substantive importance. We assess the
   scores through criterion and construct validation and reveal new
   insights into effective lawmaking across legislators. We then offer two
   illustrations of the immense opportunities that these scores provide for
   new scholarship on legislative behavior. First, we demonstrate greater
   majority-party influence over lawmaking in states featuring ideological
   polarization and majority-party cohesion, and where there is greater
   electoral competition for chamber control. Second, we show how
   institutional design choices-from legislative rules to the scope of
   professionalization-affect the distributions of policymaking power from
   state to state.},

Abstract = {A political actor's strategic narratives will be accepted if they appeal
   to the target audience's master narratives, but acceptance is not a
   singular outcome. By building on the internarrativity framework by
   examining the audience as a narrator and identifying distortions in
   meaning between two narrative tellings, this paper analyzes the `Taiwan
   Can Help' campaign as a strategic narrative that was overtly accepted by
   the U.S. while still being distorted and constrained by the same master
   narratives that enabled acceptance. The U.S. audience's reproductions of
   Taiwan's narrative only preserved elements that affirmed its
   exceptionalist self-identity and threat perceptions while overlooking
   the particulars of Taiwan's pandemic response model that the original
   narrative emphasised. This research contributes to the understanding
   that the discursive environment constrains Taiwan's capability to reach
   its full potential in projecting substantial influence in US-Taiwan
   relations, addressing Taiwan's unequal predicament, and garnering
   political support.},

Abstract = {Much research has suggested that Republican candidates in U.S.
   presidential elections benefit from voter bias against non-White groups.
   The present study supplements this research by including in the analysis
   bias against Whites. Estimates from the American National Election
   Studies 2020 Time Series Study indicated that a nontrivial percentage of
   the U.S. population has a bias that disfavors Whites, with this bias
   more prevalent among Democrats than Republicans. Further analyses
   estimated the extent to which the type of voter racial bias that favors
   Republican presidential candidates offsets the type of voter racial bias
   that favors Democratic presidential candidates. Estimates for the 2020
   U.S. presidential election indicated that the two-party vote share for
   Donald Trump was higher among voters who rated Whites, Blacks,
   Hispanics, and Asians/Asian-Americans equal to each other on 0-to-100
   feeling thermometers than among the full population of two-party voters,
   suggesting that Donald Trump was disadvantaged on net by the electorate
   including racially biased voters. These results call into question
   research that has used an unrepresentative set of racial attitudes to
   suggest that, in recent U.S. presidential elections, only Republican
   candidates have benefitted from racial bias among the electorate.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we argue that white supremacist values have been
   mainstreamed in the United States, and that the values driving the male
   supremacist and white supremacist movements are significant in fueling
   mass sympathy for January 6th (J6). To examine the white and male
   supremacy questions in relation to J6, we draw on a national survey from
   IPSOS. We also commissioned a poll with Harris Insights. The IPSOS poll
   was conducted from July 30 to August 16, 2021, and includes a nationally
   representative sample of 5,299 Americans. The Harris poll was conducted
   from October 20-25, 2022, and contacted a nationally representative
   sample of 2,029 Americans. We argue that J6 should be understood at the
   nexus point between white supremacist, populist, and fascist politics,
   not only in terms of the values driving the insurrectionists, but those
   in the mass public who are sympathetic to them. Right-wing populism, we
   believe, privileges white supremacy and white nationalism, male
   supremacy and political leadership that relies on an appeal to the cult
   of patriarchal personality, trust in the wisdom of ``the peopl e,{''}
   and distrust of political leadersparticularly Democratic leaderswho are
   framed as ``corrupt,{''} `` out of touc h{''} `` elites{''} working
   against the public good and democrac y.},

Abstract = {Well-functioning political representation presupposes that the
   substantive focus of parties' parliamentary efforts reflects the issues
   on which parties campaigned. Although the link between electoral
   campaigning and parliamentary practice is crucial for successful
   representation in modern democracies, we still have little evidence that
   the issues on which political actors campaigned are the ones they focus
   on in day-to-day politics. We investigate the link between electoral
   campaigning and parliamentary practice by examining the overlap between
   parties' issue attention in manifestos and parliamentary questions. Our
   results for parties' issue attention in local campaigns and in local
   councils in Germany between 2011 and 2020 show that parties follow up on
   the issues they campaign on: The more parties emphasise an issue in
   their campaign, the more they pay attention to it in their parliamentary
   activities.
   Eine gut funktionierende politische Reprasentation setzt voraus, dass
   der inhaltliche Fokus der parlamentarischen Bemuhungen der Parteien
   denjenigen Themen entspricht, fur die sie im Wahlkampf eingetreten sind.
   Obwohl die Verbindung zwischen Wahlkampf und parlamentarischer Praxis
   entscheidend fur eine erfolgreiche Reprasentation in modernen
   Demokratien ist, haben wir immer noch wenig Evidenz dafur, dass die
   Themen, fur die politische Akteure im Wahlkampf eintraten, auch
   diejenigen sind, auf die sie sich im politischen Alltag konzentrieren.
   Wir untersuchen den Zusammenhang zwischen Wahlkampf und
   parlamentarischer Praxis, indem wir die uberschneidung zwischen der
   thematischen Aufmerksamkeit der Parteien in ihren Wahlprogrammen und
   parlamentarischen Anfragen analysieren. Unsere Ergebnisse fur die
   thematische Aufmerksamkeit der Parteien in kommunalen Wahlkampfen und in
   Stadtraten in Deutschland zwischen 2011 und 2020 zeigen, dass Parteien
   diejenigen Themen verfolgen, fur die sie im Wahlkampf eingetreten sind:
   Je starker Parteien ein Thema im Wahlkampf betonen, desto mehr
   Aufmerksamkeit schenken sie diesem Thema in ihren parlamentarischen
   Aktivitaten.
   Une representation politique fonctionnelle presuppose que l'accent
   substantiel des efforts parlementaires des partis reflete les questions
   pour lesquelles ils ont fait campagne. Bien que le lien entre la
   campagne electorale et la pratique parlementaire soit crucial pour une
   representation reussie dans les democraties modernes, nous disposons
   encore de peu de preuves que les questions pour lesquelles les acteurs
   politiques ont fait campagne sont celles sur lesquelles ils se
   concentrent dans la politique quotidienne. Nous examinons le lien entre
   la campagne electorale et la pratique parlementaire en examinant le
   chevauchement entre l'attention portee aux enjeux dans les manifestes
   des partis et les questions parlementaires. Nos resultats pour
   l'attention aux enjeux dans les campagnes locales et dans les conseils
   locaux en Allemagne entre 2011 et 2020 montrent que les partis se
   concentrent sur les enjeux pour lesquelles ils ont fait campagne: plus
   les partis mettent l'accent sur un enjeu dans leur campagne, plus ils y
   pretent attention dans leurs activites parlementaires.
   Una rappresentanza politica degna di questo nome presuppone che parte
   sostanziale dell'attivita parlamentare dei partiti politici rifletta le
   questioni su cui essi hanno fatto campagna. Sebbene il nesso tra
   campagna elettorale e attivita parlamentare sia cruciale per una buona
   rappresentanza nelle democrazie moderne, abbiamo ancora poche prove che
   le questioni messe in avanti durante le campagne vengano anche trattate
   nella politica quotidiana. In questo articolo analizziamo quindi tale
   nesso, ossia in quale misura le questioni messe in avanti nei programmi
   dei partiti riflettano la successiva attivita parlamentare. I nostri
   risultati, focalizzati sul livello comunale in Germania tra il 2011 e il
   2020, mostrano che i partiti danno effettivamente un seguito alle
   questioni per cui hanno fatto campagna: piu un partito mette l'accento
   su una data questione nella sua campagna elettorale, piu le presta
   attenzione nella sua attivita parlamentare.},

Abstract = {For all the recent talk of people failing or succeeding as allies to
   oppressed groups, a well worked out philosophical theory of what it is
   for someone to be an ally is conspicuously absent. This makes it
   difficult to evaluate the claims of people failing or succeeding as
   allies, and consequently diminishes the concept's usefulness to
   disadvantaged groups by making it difficult to identify who will
   genuinely help to further their interests. We aim to rectify this
   absence by answering the following question: what is an ally? On the
   view that we develop, allyship is a regrettably hierarchical
   relationship that holds between a privileged individual and an oppressed
   group, and is formed through a series of actions taken by the privileged
   individual in a bid to contribute towards bringing that hierarchy to an
   end.},

Abstract = {This paper studies whether media cues can motivate interest in reporting
   suspected unauthorized immigrants to Immigration and Customs Enforcement
   (ICE). Using web search data and automated content analysis of cable
   news transcripts, we examine the role of media coverage on searches for
   how to report immigrants to ICE and searches about immigrant crime and
   welfare dependency. We find significant and persistent increases in news
   segments on crime by after Trump's inauguration, accompanied by a sharp
   increase in searches for how to report immigrants. We find a strong
   association between daily reporting searches and immigration and crime
   coverage. Using searches during broadcasts of presidential speeches, we
   isolate the specific effect of anti-immigrant media coverage on searches
   for how to report immigrants to ICE. The findings indicate that the
   media's choices regarding the coverage of immigrants can have a strong
   impact on the public's interest in behaviour that directly harms
   immigrants.},

Abstract = {Motivated by the difficulty of ensuring gender equality and the chaotic
   state of democracy, we analyze the effects of gender political inclusion
   and democracy on environmental policy performance. The study uses a
   panel of 45 African countries over the period 2012-2018 and employs the
   method of moments by quantile regression. The results show that gender
   political inclusion and democracy positively affect environmental
   performance in all quantiles. These positive effects tend to be stronger
   at higher quantiles. The magnitude is larger for gender political
   inclusion. When performance is decomposed into the sub indices of
   environmental health and ecosystem vitality, positive effects of gender
   political inclusion and democracy are observed in all quantiles. The
   effects are larger for the gender dimension than for the democracy
   dimension, regardless of the sub index used.},

Abstract = {This study provides new insights into how the EU dimension relates to
   the left-right dimension in national politics. It does so by examining
   to what extent parties' oppositional behaviour in EU affairs in
   parliament is a function of their distance from the government, other
   parties, the voters and party supporters on the EU dimension and the
   left-right dimension, respectively. The results suggest that
   oppositional behaviour is determined by two parallel dynamics: when
   expressing opposition, political parties are receptive both to the
   positions of the government and other parties on the EU dimension, and
   to the positions of voters and supporters on the left-right dimension.
   The results of the study thus indicate that the politicisation of EU
   affairs in national parliaments primarily is an elite phenomenon. In
   their relation to the voters and supporters, parties still principally
   navigate along the traditional left-right dimension.},

Title = {Selecting for Masculinity: Women's Under-Representation in the

Abstract = {The gap between women's representation in the Democratic and Republican
   parties has grown significantly in the last three decades. We argue
   existing explanations undervalue voters' contributions to this trend by
   focusing on voter responses to candidate sex rather than candidate
   gender. We theorize that Republican voters (especially the most
   conservative) prefer masculine candidates in intraparty and entry-level
   elections. Because sex and gender are correlated, this limits the number
   of Republican women who advance through the political pipeline.
   Experimental vignettes from two rounds of the Cooperative Congressional
   Election Study (N = 2,000) and two large surveys of Republicans (N >
   10,000) show that Republican (but not Democratic) voters penalize
   candidates with ``feminine{''} self-presentation regardless of the
   candidate's sex. Original data on the self-presentation of Republican
   candidates for entry-level office (N = 459) confirm Republican
   candidates often present themselves in gender-stereotypical ways. In
   short, voters play an underappreciated role in the partisan gap in
   women's representation.},

   difficult task. The stakes are high, not only for researchers interested
   in uncovering the drivers of democratic consolidation or decline but
   also for policy makers, civil society organizations, journalists,
   activists, and citizens who work daily to promote and protect human
   rights at home and abroad. In light of the significance of the task, it
   is not surprising that the issue of how to measure democracy most
   accurately continues to be hotly debated.},

Abstract = {The influence of congressional primary elections on candidate
   positioning remains disputed and poorly understood. We test whether
   candidates communicate artificially ``extreme{''} positions during the
   nomination, as revealed by moderation following a primary defeat. We
   apply a scaling method based on candidates language on Twitter to
   estimate positions of 988 candidates in contested US House of
   Representatives primaries in 2020 over time, demonstrating validity
   against NOMINATE (r > 0.93) where possible. Losing Democratic candidates
   moderated significantly after their primary defeat, indicating strategic
   position-taking for perceived electoral benefit, where the nomination
   contest induced artificially ``extreme{''} communication. We find no
   such effect among Republicans. These findings have implications for
   candidate strategy in two-stage elections and provide further evidence
   of elite partisan asymmetry.},

Abstract = {Previous work has shown candidate electability is an important
   consideration to voters in deciding who to support. However, we do not
   know what candidate qualities voters consider more electable, especially
   in the absence of polling information. While scholarship has documented
   general election penalties for candidates with certain demographic and
   ideological characteristics, we do not know whether voters actually use
   these factors when judging electability. Using a conjoint experimental
   design, we examine how candidate characteristics influence perceptions
   of candidate electability. We find voters perceive women and minorities
   as less electable and ideologically extreme candidates as more
   electable. However, perceptions of electability vary with voter
   characteristics. Our results indicate that arguments about electability,
   for many individuals, are based on their own ideological preferences
   (and to a lesser extent, their identity) rather than systematically
   viewing candidates with attributes that provide general election
   advantages as more electable.},

Abstract = {Commodities are economic and symbolic objects, two aspects that merge in
   Marx's analysis of commodity fetishism, where two ontological and
   phenomenological planes operate. Their subject is the twofold social
   objectivity of the commodity as the product of labor and the object of
   exchange deriving from the dual nature of capitalist social relations as
   the real subsumption of labor under the command of capital in production
   and as market reciprocity in circulation. The reconstruction of the
   logical structure of Marx's analysis of the commodity allows for
   grasping the form of value and the fetishistic character of capitalist
   society. Value emerges as the objective abstract form of capitalist
   class relations acting as an automatic social code of equivalence
   between abstract labor in production and solvent social needs in market
   exchange. The disjunctive synthesis between labor exploitation and the
   formal equality of exchange constitutes value as a real abstraction in
   capitalism.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the origins and evolution of the direita
   envergonhada ({''}embarrassed right{''}) phenomenon, a pattern of
   ideological obfuscation by right-of-center politicians that was
   originally identified and documented in post-authoritarian Brazil.
   Conservative politicians refused to identify themselves as right-wing,
   defining themselves instead as centrists and placing themselves
   ideologically to the left of their own political parties. We find that
   this phenomenon is not restricted to Brazil, but is widespread across
   Latin America's Third Wave of democratization. We also find that
   politicians personally connected to the defunct authoritarian regime
   were more likely to engage in obfuscation and that, contrary to previous
   hypotheses, obfuscation has faded in recent times.},

Abstract = {If policy makers wish to encourage members of a population to take a
   socially beneficial action, should they reward those who take the
   desired behavior or punish those who do not? This article develops a
   model that facilitates both utilitarian and majoritarian perspectives on
   the use of incentives and disincentives in public policy. An asymmetry
   arises between the two types of policy: as incentives grow, higher
   shares of the population take the beneficial action and earn the reward,
   driving administrative costs up; as disincentives grow, however, smaller
   shares of the population fail to take the desired action, requiring
   fewer fines and exerting downward pressure on administrative costs.
   Domains that favor inducing high (low) shares of the population to take
   a desired behavior thus indirectly favor the use of disincentives
   (incentives). Distributive implications amplify this tendency, such that
   majoritarian influence on policy making tends to generate stronger
   disincentives and weaker incentives than are efficient.},

Abstract = {In societies, unemployment is both an economic, social, and political
   problem. For this reason, to reduce unemployment is among the main goals
   of governments all over the world. When it think with Okun Act, this
   target is also related to economic growth. This goal has always been a
   valid goal. However, during the development process of the world economy
   after the 1990s and the 2000s, the production conditions and importance
   of the workforce have changed significantly compared to the past. In
   order to analyse the unemployment experienced in the world economy and
   in Turkiye after 1990, it is necessary to analyse this change process
   experienced by the world economy. In this context, the first part of
   this paper is devoted to examining basic concepts such as labour force,
   employment, and unemployment, and examining changes in the world
   economy. In the second part of this article, the development of
   unemployment in terms of countries, country groups, and Turkiye in the
   world economy in the 1990s and thereafter, and the development of the
   resources allocated to education in terms of GDP, public expenditures
   and labour underutilisation are examined. Because of this investigation,
   it has been determined that unemployment in Turkiye has a chronic
   increasing trend from 1991 to 2023 but in here especially
   underutilisation and educated people's unemployment has increased more
   intensively.},

Abstract = {Enhancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging is a priority for
   political science. However, recruitment of historically underrepresented
   graduate students, and subsequently faculty, remains lackluster. While
   numerous initiatives, such as the Ralph Bunche Summer Institute, have
   helped address the inequities, biases, and obstacles that perpetuate the
   lack of diversity in academia, the question remains how to create a
   successful, sustainable, and scalable intervention that can reach a
   broader population. This article introduces the Pipeline Initiative in
   Political Science, which was evaluated using the first randomized trial
   of a political science pipeline intervention. The program successfully
   recruited first-generation and underrepresented students, who were then
   admitted through a random lottery to the one-semester program. The
   program resulted in a 48.9 percentage point increase in the number of
   students who felt prepared to apply to PhD programs and helped students
   dramatically improve their application materials, thus increasing their
   chance of admission to graduate school.},

Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2024},
Number = {32},
Abstract = {The article aims at reconstructing the various channels through which
   fascist Italy attempted to promote the ideology, debate and
   `achievements' of its corporatist construction in France. Publications,
   conferences, courses and congresses devoted to the subject will
   therefore be analysed, with particular attention paid to events such as
   the Italo-French conference held in Rome in 1935. A central aspect, less
   addressed by historiography, is the reception of the fascist project and
   the different positions taken in the French political and intellectual
   world, between expressions of interest and demands for an autonomous
   tradition as an alternative to the authoritarian centralism of the
   Mussolini regime. Finally, it is important to place the French
   reflection on the Italian model within the broader framework of the
   transnational debate that developed in the 1930s around the revision of
   liberal principles and the role of public intervention in the economic
   order.},

   in the Covid-19 Pandemic},
Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},

Abstract = {This paper explores the limitations of neoliberal concepts of resilience
   and the possibilities of abolition in the discourses surrounding the
   Covid-19 pandemic in Canada. I locate Canada's state discussions at the
   outset of the pandemic in 2020 in the neoliberal model of resilience
   that is rooted in ideologies of individualism and carcerality, rather
   than the deconstruction of the interdependent systems that create them -
   despite the temporary questioning of the status quo in political
   discourse. To contrast the mobilization ofneoliberal resilience, I
   introduce the Doctors forDefunding the Police collective and analyze how
   they mobilize a more radical praxis by approaching pandemic discourse
   through a framework of abolition and healing justice. Finally, I draw on
   Ndlovu-Gatsheni's (2023) analysis of the components of reworlding from
   the Global South, locating the praxis of Doctors for Defunding the
   Police in this tradition due to its rejection of neoliberal
   individualism, its embrace of alternative subjectivities, and its turn
   towards a politics of collective care. Ultimately, I argue that while
   the 2020 resilience discourse afforded an approach to the pandemic that
   did not fully abandon the population, it remained fundamentally tied to
   neoliberalism and racial capitalism, whereas the abolitionist response
   offered a more transformative praxis of reworlding through its
   commitment to deconstructing harmful systems and reviving a decolonial
   praxis of collectivity. To conclude, I examine how the contemporary
   politics of Covid-19 continue to embrace colonial and carceral
   realities, necessitating a continued abolitionist praxis of reworlding.},

   Literature},
Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-58},
Abstract = {Canadian children's literature rarely depicts characters labelled with
   intellectual disabilities, yet when it does it often remains mired in
   stereotypes that recycle prevalent myths and misconceptions. Even as
   more recent literature attempts to push back against such stereotypes,
   it nevertheless predominantly remains caught in these dangerous
   representational repertoires. This article offers a brief history of
   Canadian literary depictions of intellectual disability and a critique
   of the Canadian publishing spheres. Through a critical analysis of Lorna
   Schultz Nicholson's book Fragile Bones, we discuss the limits of
   representation of intellectual disability in children's fiction. We also
   offer a critique of the ableist publishing climate in Canada and suggest
   that structural barriers prevent disabled writers from entering the
   literary marketplace on an equal playing field. These barriers to
   publishing lead to the vast underrepresentation of disabled authors and
   the misrepresentation of disability in general and intellectual
   disability in particular in Canadian children's literature.},

Abstract = {Turkish soft power has experienced a decline over the last decade. The
   existing literature has mostly neglected the assessment of the influence
   of both the leader's conception and domestic and international changes
   on Turkish soft power. Addressing this issue, this article aims to
   answer the following research question: How did Erdo \& gbreve;an's
   conception and performance of his role influence the evolution of
   Turkish soft power from 2013 to 2023? 2013 is the year the Gezi protests
   highlighted Erdo \& gbreve;an's authoritarianism, denigrating his
   reputation both nationally and internationally, and representing a
   turning point in Turkish politics. The year 2023 coincides with the
   centenary of the Turkish Republic, while also marking nearly two decades
   of Erdo \& gbreve;an's uninterrupted rule. The methodology we use
   combines the analysis of primary sources-official documents, reports and
   soft power indices-and secondary sources, based on the assumptions of
   role theory, namely role conception, role expectations, role adaptation
   and role performance. Despite Erdo \& gbreve;an's investment in
   increasing the number of Turkish embassies and consulates, strengthening
   development aid, awarding scholarships and institutes to promote Turkish
   culture and language abroad, among other things, this has not translated
   into an improvement in Turkish soft power. In practice, external
   expectations of Erdo \& gbreve;an's role reflect the fact that these
   initiatives have not been able to counter the dissatisfaction felt
   abroad with the departure from democratic ideals that has accompanied
   the Turkish leader's consolidation of power.},

   business},
Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2024},
Number = {32},
Abstract = {In 1934, the American writer Roger Shaw stated that ``the functioning of
   the NRA (National Recovery Administration) is clearly an American-style
   adaptation of the Italian corporate state{''}. Mussolini himself proudly
   recognised the mark of fascism in the New Deal overseas. The purpose of
   this paper, however, is not a historical-ideological comparison. Indeed,
   recent work has shown that rather than following fascism, the New Deal
   shows the entry of global tendencies into American politics and that the
   NRA's precedent was the War Industries Board of 1917 rather than Alfredo
   Rocco and Carlo Costamagna's Labour Charter. It is also now clear that
   fascist corporatism was one of those national experiments that enjoyed
   transnational and Atlantic appeal and circulation. Instead, the paper
   will focus on these main global tendencies, the emergence of plan
   thinking, and what we see as the red thread that holds together
   experiments in reforming and restructuring capitalism. Such experiments
   are varied and and not confined to the history of totalitarianism and
   the rise of authoritarian regimes. Therefore, the essay analyses how,
   with what weight and effects, plan thinking played a part in turning the
   fascist corporate state and the New Deal into alternatives to Soviet
   planning that threatened to be the only real alternative to capitalism.},

Abstract = {This research aims to analyze the recorded data on events, cases of
   victims and humanitarian demining of anti-personnel mines (MAP in
   Spanish), improvised explosive devices (AEI in Spanish) similar to
   anti-personnel mines and unexploded ordnance in Colombia. This research
   has a quantitative approach based on longitudinal evolutionary design.
   The KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) methodology was used for data
   mining. This information source is the Departamento Administrativo de la
   Presidencia de la Republica-DAPRE, which shows 12,390 victims, mostly
   adult injured adult men. another finding is that humanitarian demining
   operations are concentrated in departments such as Antioquia, Meta and
   Santander. It is estimated that in Colombia the territory with mines
   covers around 46,024,965 m(2), and around 13,631,728 m(2) have been
   cleared. This efforts have reached 29.62\% of the cleared area in
   activities or operations. These numerical conclusions allow us to say
   that consequences of munitions include not only injuries and deaths, but
   also physical, psychological, social and economic impacts on affected
   communities. The population forced displacement by the presence of
   antipersonnel mines also stands out as a significant consequence.},

Abstract = {Due to its special status and peaceful occupation policy, Denmark was
   long regarded as a ``model protectorate{''} of the Nazi regime during
   World War II. This did not change until the end of 1943, when a wave of
   sabotage and strikes led to the resignation of the Danish government and
   the German occupying power responded to the ongoing attacks by the
   Danish resistance with a new security policy. Assassinations and acts of
   sabotage were now retaliated against in the same way. Given this
   context, the article examines the background and the establishment of
   the so-called ``counter-terrorism{''}. At the same time, the article
   discusses the central consequences of this special policy of retaliation
   and examines the political consequences associated with the dynamics of
   security and insecurity.},

Abstract = {We describe a natural experiment occasioned by an abrupt increase in the
   transmission range of an independent Tanzanian radio station whose
   broadcasts emphasize current affairs and gender equality. Some villages
   that formerly lay outside the catchment area of this radio station could
   now receive it, while nearby villages remained outside of reception
   range. Before the change in transmitter range in 2018, we conducted a
   baseline survey in both treated and untreated villages and found them to
   be similar in terms of prevailing social attitudes and political
   interest. An endline survey conducted in 2020 shows that respondents in
   areas that received the new radio signal were substantially more likely
   to listen to the station, and their levels of political interest and
   knowledge about domestic politics were significantly higher than their
   counterparts in villages that the signal could not reach. Attitude
   change on a range of gender issues, however, was sporadic.},

   Interest},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {With the increase of human power, intergenerational conflicts of
   interest have emerged as new problems, particularly in terms of
   environmental and financial sustainability. This study examined the role
   of moral principles in inducing people to act, taking into account the
   interests of future generations. A survey was conducted among a
   representative sample of Japanese citizens to investigate the function
   of eight moral principles in resolving conflicts in terms of
   participants' assessment of the appropriateness of the principles and
   their willingness to follow them. With respect to the absolute level of
   the function of moral principles, the results offer some, albeit
   cautious, promise of a strategy to resolve conflicts through moral
   principles. Overall, participants responded positively to these
   principles. Furthermore, the survey revealed that older and more
   educated individuals responded better. Given their leading roles in
   society, this finding supports the use of the principles. However, it
   also suggests that reaching out to those who did not respond to the
   strategy is challenging. The study revealed that a non-negligible
   proportion of respondents had only weak responses to any of the
   principles and that they either needed to be exposed to different
   principles or provided with different resources to develop sensitivity
   to moral ideas. The survey also revealed the relative order of
   principles. Egalitarianism and utilitarianism scored lower, but some
   principles, including Mill's harm principle and Scheffler's argument
   that the survival of humanity and the world itself has value, scored
   higher.},

   wielded as instruments of power. But where there's no power, the
   performative act becomes magical thinking. This is the case with the
   maps showing Russia's collapse that have been circulating in Ukraine.
   They are created mechanistically, with existing administrative borders
   usually being upgraded so that republics or other administrative units
   become states. This also merely transfers the Soviet Union's pattern of
   collapse onto Russia. Another method is to transfer historical borders
   onto a desirable future. This has little to do with the real political
   and social conditions. What is ignored is that this copies Putin's
   methods and, in addition, provides Moscow material for propaganda.},

Abstract = {Francis White, an officer of the New Model Army with a successful yet
   turbulent military career, opposed the trial of Charles I Stuart. He did
   so not in spite of some royalist sympathy: he was able to recognize how
   the recourse to legal form hid a trap. English law, grown under the
   shadows of monarchy, could hardly be used to judge a ruler in a feasible
   and convenient manner. Also strength, the possession of that same Sword
   brandished by monarchs of every age to establish their dynasties, was
   already a more than sufficient tool to dispose of the matter. The New
   Model Army, victor of the Civil War, didn't need law and, ultimately,
   even violence. The article will retrace the main steps in White's
   thought with the conviction that his view, that of a military officer
   and often reluctant author, may be particularly representative of a
   difficult moment in English history, when the army's influence becomes
   growingly strong on the political scene. Despite the lucidity of White's
   view, similar to the one displayed by Robespierre during the French
   Revolution, naked strength doesn't seem sufficient: to deal with the
   problem of royalty, both for Charles I and Louis XVI, the Sword wears
   the robes of the judge.},

Title = {Winning or Losing Hearts and Minds? Evidence from Afghanistan on How
   Leadership Decapitation Affects Civilian Perceptions of Government
   Efficacy},

Abstract = {While the efficacy of leadership decapitation (i.e., the killing or
   capturing of top leaders of militant groups) is much debated, one aspect
   that remains unexplored is whether the tactic contributes to ``winning
   the hearts and minds{''} of civilian populations-a vital component of
   counterterrorism campaigns. Although state actors often publicize
   targeted killings of militant leaders as significant ``wins,{''} this
   study explores how militant leadership decapitation affects civilians'
   perceptions of government efficacy. We argue that decapitation efforts,
   which involve local security actors, are more likely to improve
   perceptions of local government efficacy, compared to efforts driven by
   external actors, while undermining perceptions of militants' strength.
   We test our argument using data on leadership losses of Islamic State
   leaders in Afghanistan between 2015 and 2018 and public opinion survey
   data. Our findings suggest that while all leadership targeting generally
   undermined civilian perceptions of militant strength, it was largely
   Afghan-led efforts that improved civilian perceptions of government
   efficacy while US-led efforts failed to shift perceptions.},

Abstract = {This article aims to identify the reason and the way in which armed
   actors settled on the urban-rural border of Medellin to ensure
   geographical continuity between the city and the region. Despite the
   existence of urban structures, for greater capacity for action it was
   necessary to coordinate with regional structures. Therein lies the
   strategic character of the urban-rural border. Thus, the reasons that
   the armed actors themselves claimed to have for being in the city were
   contrasted with the georeferencing of their presence and behavior in the
   territory. This showed other possible purposes for the location in a
   specific place and the way in which they connected with their rear. The
   article indicates that the possibility of constructing corridors to the
   region's west depended on the actor, since the infrastructure for the
   passage of the Cauca River has a greater presence of Public Forces and
   the characteristics of the territory made it vulnerable to armed
   insurgency against paramilitarism. This is why the sea access corridors
   are a historical construction of the paramilitaries for their drug
   trafficking economy, which currently continues to generate new and
   constant patterns of violence on the urban- rural border of western
   Medellin.},

Abstract = {Only a third of Buriatia's population belongs to the titular nation. The
   collectivisation of agriculture and industrialisation under Soviet rule
   have left their mark. Since Perestroika, a renaissance of the Buddhist
   faith has been observed. The desire for a merger with Buriat-populated
   territories, which arose in Buriatia in the early 2000s, remained
   unfulfilled. The Putin regime has curtailed the rights of national
   republics and exercises strict control over their political decision
   makers. Support for the war against Ukraine is strong in Buriatia.},

Abstract = {In developing countries, in-person surveys are frequently conducted in
   the presence of respondents' family, friends, or neighbors. What effect,
   if any, does their presence have on survey responses? We use data from
   an original survey in Karachi, Pakistan, to examine how such presence
   affects responses to questions related to ethnic identity and ethnic
   politics. We find that respondents are systematically more likely to
   express greater support for ethnic politics and greater feelings of
   perceived ethnic discrimination in the presence of known others. We
   present suggestive evidence that this finding is explained by social
   desirability bias due to a norm of in-group solidarity. Our findings
   have important implications for the study of ethnic politics and for
   survey researchers working in contexts where respondent privacy is
   rarely guaranteed.},

   Revolution in Bronislaw Baczko's work. Through the perspective of
   utopian language, which makes use of the resources of the symbolic and
   imaginative background, Baczko's research attempts to restore the
   processual character of the Enlightenment and its materialization in the
   praxis of the French Revolution. Enlightenment emerges there as an
   ambivalent, open, unfinished process, in relation to which 20th-century
   history has taken on a constructive and tragic role.},

Abstract = {Nature tourism is considered one of the main segments of tourism, which
   represents a large industry that generates considerable positive and
   negative environmental, social and economic impacts on both a local and
   global scale. The objective of this research is to determine the
   perception of the local po-pulation of the municipality of Tomatl \&
   aacute;n, Jalisco, Mexico in relation to the impacts of nature tourism
   in their community. To measure the perception, the direct method was
   selected, which is based on the information provided by the population,
   with a sample size of 265 surveys, a confidence level of 95\% and a
   statistical error of +/- 6\%. The main positive impacts are that there
   is an increase in the quality of life, cultural exchange, and programs
   have been created for the conservation of natural resources and
   restoration of damaged areas in the municipality.},

Abstract = {In politics, power is key. Engaging in competitive political
   environments and gaining political power through competition can have
   significant ramifications on an individual's financial and interpersonal
   life and influence how individuals behave politically. I hypothesize
   that competition for political power causes voters to place more value
   on the importance of participation, and it triggers a strong desire to
   seek economic status by using power, which mobilizes political
   participation. Using behavioral theory and three laboratory experiments,
   I find evidence supporting these effects. I take special care to
   distinguish these effects from those induced by endogenous formation of
   group identity, strategic voting, and other compelling behavioral
   theories. Substantively, I discuss the implications of these findings in
   the context of how the civil rights movement affected Black voters'
   participation, how the process of immigration affects immigrants'
   political behavior, and how empowering women in the political processes
   influences women's participation.},

Title = {DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE AS BENELUX COUNTRIES' FOREIGN POLICY TOOL:
   STRUCTURAL AND TRANSFORMATIONAL ASPECTS},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The article discusses the use of development assistance as a foreign
   policy tool by the Benelux countries, namely Belgium, the Netherlands
   and Luxembourg. The paper aims to answer the question whether the
   development assistance provided by the Benelux states corresponds to
   their political statements which cite this policy area as a soft power
   instrument, or the three approaches to development assistance rather
   reflect other goals, e.g. beneficial economic cooperation with
   developing countries. The article analyzes international statistical
   data, sociological surveys and official development assistance-related
   documents, using qualitative historical and descriptive as well as
   genealogical and historical methods to trace the evolution of the three
   countries' approaches. The concepts of small and middle powers, to which
   the Benelux countries belong, and the concept of soft power constitute
   the theoretical and methodological framework of the research. The
   article concludes that the Benelux countries' approaches to development
   assistance are different, complex and changeable. The pursuit of
   economic goals helps explain at least some of the three states'
   geographic and functional priorities, which translate into defining
   countries where Benelux' companies are situated as key partners or
   specializing in the development assistance areas where these companies
   can be involved. This pursuit is most clearly evident in the Dutch
   approach, while Luxembourg seems to value soft power function more as it
   enhances the country's image as one of the most generous donors and a
   responsible member of the international community. Unlike Luxembourg,
   the Netherlands and Belgium show a downward trend in the amount of
   assistance allocated (with the exception of 2015 and 2022), amid doubts
   about the effectiveness of development assistance and securitization of
   this area; however, the ongoing public debates keep relevant the use of
   development assistance as soft power vis-\& agrave;-vis the countries of
   the Global South.},

Abstract = {In the current conditions of confrontation with the West, Russia seeks
   to diversify its external relations, hence a growing attention it pays
   to such partners as African countries. Establishing effective
   cooperation requires deep knowledge of political elites, which is
   largely facilitated by the research of Russian Africanists, conducted
   primarily at the Institute of African Studies of the Russian Academy of
   Sciences as well as in other research centers- the Centre for African
   Studies of the Institute of World History of the Russian Academy of
   Sciences, the Institute of Asian and African Countries of Moscow State
   University, MGIMO University, HSE University, IMEMO of the Russian
   Academy of Sciences, the Oriental Faculty of St. Petersburg State
   University, etc. Among their areas of interest are such subjects as the
   study of female political elites, as well as the elites in multilateral
   institutions, primarily in the UN structures. Since the early 2000s, one
   of the main features of the formation of political leadership in the
   Republic of South Africa (South Africa) has been the expansion of
   women's representation in government bodies at all levels. Some of these
   women held leadership positions in various UN structures. This article
   uses functional and biographical research methods to analyze the
   activities of South African women who have been active in human rights
   issues, in the fight against hunger and HIV/AIDS at the national and
   international levels, at the UN and the African Union. This article's
   research was centered at such prominent South African political figures
   as Mrs. N. Pillay, Mrs. P. Mlambo-Ngcuka, and Mrs. S. Sisulu. The author
   notes both their achievements in solving the above-mentioned
   contemporary problems and the difficulties they encountered in their
   activities. Special attention is paid to the attitude of South African
   women towards the issue of gender equality, which they consider a
   necessary condition for democratic development. At various multilateral
   venues, Mrs. N. Pillay, Mrs. P. Mlambo-Ngcuka, and Mrs. S. Sisulu
   advocated for the empowerment of women in all areas of political,
   economic, and public life, both while holding leadership positions in
   the UN and after completing their terms of office. The long-standing
   work of South African women at the UN in the fight for human rights,
   against hunger and HIV/AIDS and for gender equality demonstrates the
   possibility of women's participation in solving contemporary problems at
   levels of utmost significance.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {This article reviews the presence of political scientists in Spanish
   public administrations. The text is divided into three sections: first,
   a descriptive analysis of the representation of political scientists in
   the public service of Spain in the recent past and the present.
   Secondly, an analysis of the value that political scientists bring to
   modern public management in which their multidisciplinary and versatile
   profile stands out provided by the degree in Political Science and
   Administration. Finally, the study delves into the prospective analysis
   and examines the changes that are potentially going to take place in
   public administrations and how these will affect the new competencies
   that public employees of the future will have to acquire. Political
   scientists can absorb these transformations and mutations of
   professional profiles quite smoothly as long as the curricula of
   specialized degrees and master's degree programs in Political Science
   and Public Management incorporate subjects that address the new
   competencies required. The conclusion is that in the near past, as well
   as in the present and the future, the presence of political scientists
   in our public administrations is not very significant at a quantitative
   level due to the low weight of graduates in Political Science and Public
   Administration in comparison with other university degrees, but their
   qualitative presence is very relevant considering the strategic
   positions occupied by political scientists.},

Abstract = {Why do some authoritarian regimes improve human development while others
   do not? Despite advances in research explaining different economic
   outcomes in democracies, little is known about why autocrats might
   improve living conditions in their countries. I argue that autocrats who
   allow executive elections face greater short-term risk of losing power.
   Consequently, they should be more likely to improve human development.
   To evaluate this argument, I use a sample of 135 autocracies between
   1972 and 2008 and I conduct several cross-sectional time -series models.
   Evidence suggests that executive elections improve human development in
   autocracies in the short term.},

Abstract = {Spain has become a major target of Islamic jihadists due to its specific
   history and unique geographic location. Since the jihadist terrorist
   attacks in Madrid in 2004, Spain and European countries decided to
   increase their focus on Islamic extremism. However, it was only after
   the domestic separatist terrorism was effectively curbed that the
   Spanish Government formally focused on addressing the Islamic extremism
   represented by Jihadism, at the national strategic level. The period
   from 2012 to 2019 had gone through three stages of development, and
   Spain's counter-radicalization policy had a comprehensive course of
   action, a full range of fields of action, and diversified subjects of
   action. Since 2012, the Spanish Government has implemented a number of
   initiatives within the framework of its counter-radicalization policy.
   The main actions include revising the legislative framework, broadening
   the channels for citizen participation, strengthening international
   cooperation, and implementing de-radicalization programs. Overall,
   Spain's counter-radicalization measures have made considerable progress
   in the areas of legislative reform, citizen cooperation, and
   international cooperation, but they are still facing problems and
   challenges at the levels of prison de-radicalization, extremist
   counter-narratives, and central-local cooperation.},

Abstract = {Against the backdrop of more than 20 years of existence of the United
   Nations Organization Mission in Congo/Mission de l'Organization des
   Nations Unies au Congo (MONUSCO), the East African Community (EAC)
   deployed a military force in the eastern part of the country in November
   2022. The purpose of the East African Community Regional Force (EACRF)
   was to contribute towards the resolution of the conflict that has
   ravaged the region for decades, and specifically to neutralise the M23
   resurgence and the numerous informal armed groups. The regional economic
   community that brings together eight countries, namely, Burundi,
   Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South
   Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda was doing this for the first time since its
   establishment in 1999. Slightly over a year since its deployment, and
   eventual withdrawal in December 2023, there are several questions that
   arise which are the subject of this article: (i) Why did the EAC deploy
   EACRF when there is MONUSCO? (ii) to what extent had EACRF achieved its
   objective? (iii) was the mandate of the regional force appropriate for
   the situation in eastern DRC and how did it compare to that of MONUSCO?
   (iv) what are the challenges and prospects for peace, security and
   political stability in the DRC? While the article relies predominantly
   on secondary data, it taps into limited primary sources obtained by one
   of the authors during field humanitarian assignments in different parts
   in DRC.},

Abstract = {The rarity and cultural prominence of sandalwood (Santalum sp.) in
   different parts of the world, has made this species one of the most
   important commodities in the Asian market, leading a myriad of groups to
   develop a large number of cultural expressions based on a wood that does
   not grow in their territories, as has been the case in China. Through
   its particular ecology and distribution, we have identified a series of
   historical centers of sandalwood production, making India one of them.
   This way, extensive exchange networks and efforts to control these
   places and their production have been established. This phenomenon
   intensified with the arrival of Western agents in Asia in the 16th
   century who, in pursuit of the benefits of trade with China, until well
   into the 20th century, attempted to establish regimes of control and
   monopoly wherever sandalwood grew. In this article, starting from the
   nature and importance of sandalwood, we will focus on the Indian
   experience through the lens of environmental history, explaining the
   reorientation of sandalwood production towards China and identifying the
   succession of different management and trade regimes to which the tree
   was subjected, and contextualizing its importance in different
   historical processes.},

Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {54},
Pages = {389-420},
Abstract = {Journalists and media outlets hold a preferential position in accessing
   informational sources. This is an activity framed within the news
   preparation phase, and therefore forms part of the essential content of
   the right to freedom of information. This access has a particular impact
   on the Cortes Generales (Spanish Parliament) due to the public interest
   and relevance of their activities, which is why this article focuses on
   the accreditation and permanence criteria for these professionals within
   parliamentary premises. To this end, the case law of the Constitutional
   Court related to journalistic work within public authorities' premises
   is examined, as well as the regulations contained in the parliamentary
   rules and the customary practices of the parliamentary chambers. The
   analysis supports the view that press credentials should enhance the
   preferential position held by journalists. For this reason, the
   requirements for obtaining them should be limited to organizational
   reasons or the absence of a connection to institutionalized media
   outlets. Furthermore, main-taining order and respecting fundamental
   rights may serve as limits to their work within parliamentary premises,
   restricting their presence in areas not designated for informational
   purposes, or the capturing of images that could infringe upon the
   privacy and confidentiality of parliamentary communications. In any
   case, any response to a violation of the rules within parliamentary
   premises should be reduced to immediate measures arising from the police
   functions assigned to parliamentary bodies, without prejudice to the
   initiation of subsequent disciplinary proceedings, which must uphold all
   guarantees. However, the chambers do not have a regulatory framework
   that comprehensively governs all informational activities, providing
   legal backing to parliamentary administration. In its absence,
   accreditation and permanence criteria for journalists are applied, which
   seem to be inspired by constitutional case law but exceed some of its
   terms. Meanwhile, others are vague or completely omit the procedures and
   guarantees that journalists' access should have.},

Abstract = {This article contends that contemporary transnational dynamics have
   given rise to novel political subjects and territories for political
   engagement. By looking at how parties as organizational actors operate
   abroad, this study reworks extant classificatory attempts and proposes
   an amended typology in which the salient elements of variation are the
   origin of the party abroad and the degree of formalization. These two
   dimensions produce a matrix delineating four distinct types of party
   organization: branch-abroad, organization-abroad in franchising,
   committee-abroad, and semi-political structures. Conceptually, the
   typology elucidates the multifaceted nature of the structural approaches
   employed by home parties in their endeavors to establish connections
   with communities abroad. Empirically, this contribution enhances the
   comparability between organizational configurations abroad and extant
   research on party structures at the national level.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how Achille Mbembe draws upon, then iterates from,
   the work of Aim \& eacute; C \& eacute;saire to provide a rich analysis
   of personhood in contemporary Africa. Typically, African treatments of
   Mbembe's theorization place considerable emphasis on the intellectual
   influence of Frantz Fanon, rightly so. And while Fanon does have a
   central role in Mbembe's writing, arguably it is C \& eacute;saire who
   prompts Mbembe to conceptually insist upon the historical malleability
   of racial classification, racial civic ascription, and racial subjective
   comprehension as these social forms are reshaped by historical
   development. In tracing the development of these aspects of Mbembe's
   social and political thought, this paper discusses the bisections and
   points of departures with C \& eacute;saire's poetry and philosophy as
   it pertains to the notion of Blackness. Effectively the dialectical
   encounter with C \& eacute;saire and the Caribbean situation helps give
   rise to Mbembe's main conclusion that there is a severe limitation to
   Black Reasoning, especially when its discursive referents give
   preference to a sublime singularity over the mutable.},

Title = {EUROPEAN SECURITY DILEMAMS: A COMPARISON OF GERMANY AND FRANCE'S
   APPROACHES TO THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE EU AND NATO ROLES IN EUROPE AFTER
   2022},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {In 2016-2017, it was the Franco-German tandem which nurtured European
   security integration. The leaders of both states have been used to
   reaching a compromise despite different approaches to Atlanticism and
   Europeanism balance. However, the Ukrainian conflict escalation has
   changed the defense policies pursued by France and Germany. This paper
   argues, that during the last two years the differences between the two
   states concerning security issues have widened. With Germany even more
   relying on NATO as the most important security guarantor for Europe,
   France tends to simultaneously argue for a stronger, more independent
   European defense. Amid limited resources, it became more difficult for
   both parties to compromise. The article compares shifts in German and
   French policies on three levels, that are conceptual (the role of NATO
   and the EU in strategic papers and addresses of the French and German
   leaders), program-initiative (involvement in NATO and the EU security
   initiatives over the past two years), and military-industrial (joint
   projects and procurements). The research reveals that since the
   Ukrainian crisis escalation France and Germany have tended to rely on
   NATO as the main security guarantor, still the former is strongly
   committed to effectively strengthening European security. Germany and
   France differ in terms of their involvement in NATO and the EU security
   initiatives as well as procurements. Having its own nuclear weapons and
   military-industrial complex, the latter is less committed to NATO, yet
   highly supports European defense projects, seeking economic and
   political benefits. Germany prioritizes proven NATO structures,
   bilateral initiatives, as well as transatlantic defense procurements.
   The paper reveals a correlation between the policies of Germany and
   France and their dependence on the US military-industrial complex.},

Abstract = {Saadat Hasan Manto was born in 1912 in Sambrala, a small town in the
   district of Ludhiana in the state of Punjab and died in 1955 in the city
   of Lahore, Pakistan. Manto is one of the greatest Indo-Pakistani writers
   and one of the world's great short story writers. He lived a period of
   his life in India and another in Pakistan. The greatest writer on the
   subject of Partition (the period following India's independence) and
   what is known as the ``Hindu-Muslim problem{''}. Fictional and
   biographical stories, scripts for Indian cinema, newspaper and magazine
   articles, as well as work as an editor are among Manto's main
   achievements throughout his life. We can talk about changes in society,
   but the restriction of freedom of expression for writers, misogyny,
   patriarchy, persecution of minorities and other social ills are still
   growing, mainly in peripheral countries. We are witnessing the
   resurgence of far-right politics across almost the entire planet,
   including regions where a breath of democracy was temporarily felt, a
   temporary progress in politics. Despite having lived in the first half
   of the 20th century, the relevance of Manto's work is evident,
   especially when it deals with interreligious hatred and sociocultural
   issues and its victims, who are ordinary citizens and never those who
   belong to elites. The knowledge produced by Manto continues, therefore,
   to be necessary to understand what is in the social and fields.},

Title = {PEACE TREATIES IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (ON THE ISSUE OF CRITERIA AND
   SYSTEMATIZATION)},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The subject of this study is the issue of peace treaties, which are
   among the most important diplomatic acts and documents in international
   relations. Peace treaties represent one of the most important types of
   international treaties. They are an integral part of the couple
   relationship of peace and war. Their basic specificity is the fact that,
   on the one hand, they confirm the end of the war conflict and, on the
   other hand, establish measures and rules for the subsequent relations
   between the participants in the conflict. In contrast to the prevailing
   approach, which deals with this issue from the point of view of
   international law, the author approached the issue on the basis of
   historical analysis and comparison. His goal was to establish criteria
   and, based on this, systematize the most important peace treaties
   concluded in the course of the history of international relations. The
   author came to determine a total of six intertwining main models of
   peace treaties: 1. victory of one side over the other, 2. parties
   exhausted each other and none won, 3. only one of the stages of the war
   was ended, 4. participation in the conflict ended with a peace treaty
   only some parties, 5. number of parties involved, 6. content aspect of
   the treaty. Following this, the author also paid attention to other
   related problems. Specifically, these are the ratification and
   observance of peace treaties, accompanying and follow-up contractual
   arrangements, the extent and degree of punishment of the defeated party,
   and treaties intended to prevent conflict. The purpose of the study was
   to create a conceptual and systematically anchored framework for further
   research on this important part of international relations and
   diplomacy.},

Abstract = {The core idea of the OSCE, to achieve security in Europe through
   confidence-building and cooperation between all states, has been shaken.
   Russia is waging war against Ukraine and sees itself in conflict with
   the ``collective West{''}. The OSCE and its contractual foundations are
   weakened, trust has been lost, and work processes have been disrupted.
   So far, however, no participating state has questioned the
   organisation's existence. The OSCE has unique forums and instruments
   with which it can continue to work. It must prepare for the day when it
   can once again play a role in European security policy and conflict
   mediation.},

   Russia's Authoritarianism},
Journal = {OSTEUROPA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {74},
Number = {6-7},
Pages = {87+},
Abstract = {In the early 1990s, Russia's Constitutional Court was a counterweight to
   the office of the president. Today, it is a pillar of President Putin's
   power. From the late 1990s until the amendment of the constitution in
   2020, the court covered up the Kremlin's increasingly authoritarian
   policies by disguising the ever-increasing discrepancy between the 1993
   constitution and political practice. When this was no longer possible,
   the court submitted to politics. One of those who benefitted from this
   was current Constitutional Court President Valerii Zor'kin. The
   Kremlin's loyal henchman now has a position of power within the court
   that is just as unrestricted as Putin's throughout the entire state.},

Title = {Building Party Support Abroad: Turkish Diaspora Organisations in Germany
   and the UK},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {This article covers a unique form of political mobilisation within the
   Turkey -originated diasporic community in Europe that formed after
   Turkey introduced external voting in 2012. Although existing literature
   has paid attention to the impact of homeland political parties on
   external voting rights and diaspora organisations' role in electoral
   campaigns, these organisations' impact on members' mobilisation
   capacities for certain homeland parties remains understudied. This
   article tackles this topic by first comparing Turkey -originated
   diaspora organisations in Germany and the UK. Secondly, it guides future
   empirical work on the impact of the diaspora organisations on remote
   partisans' political orientation by taking the dominant emigrant profile
   in a residence country dimension into the study of external voting.
   Focusing on eligible Turkish citizens, the findings of this article are
   based on participant observation and 60 in-depth interviews conducted
   with remote voters who participated in the mobilisation of Turkey -based
   political parties in Germany between 2018 and 2023 and in the UK between
   2021 and 2023 through diaspora organisations.},

Title = {SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING AND THE NATIONAL PRIDE OF RUSSIANS: CAUSAL
   ANALYSIS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {4},
Pages = {56-70},
Abstract = {Happiness in Russia recovered rapidly along with economic growth between
   1999-2008 after a sharp decline in the 1990s. Surprisingly, however, the
   economic stagnation that followed did not prevent further growth in
   happiness levels, which reached a historic peak by the end of 2017.
   Using data from the World Values Survey and the European Values Study
   for the period 1999-2017, we have previously showed that 1) national
   pride, which began to rise in the 2000s, is strongly correlated with
   happiness; 2) national pride, as opposed to material well-being, became
   an increasingly important predictor of happiness after 2008, especially
   for the poorer segments of the population; and 3) instrumental variables
   tests suggest that it is national pride that drives the long-term
   increase in happiness, rather than the other way around. However, a
   definitive judgment on the direction of causality requires a
   longitudinal data. After 2017, Russia experienced difficulties
   associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. This
   article clarifies the nature of the correlation between national pride
   and happiness in this complicated context. We apply the method of
   seemingly unrelated regression equations to three waves of panel data
   collected in 2019-2022. The results of our study indicate that there is
   a statistically significant stable relationship between national pride
   and happiness and that it is an increase in the level of subjective
   well-being that is leading to a higher level of national pride and not
   vice versa. We conclude that subjective well-being has a positive impact
   on the national pride of Russians. However, when interpreting these
   results, one should be cautious and consider that the crisis context of
   data collection could have affected the direction of the relationship
   between the variables: in the absence of tension in the socio-economic
   structure of society, this relationship could have the opposite
   direction.},

Abstract = {The higher-educated are typically seen as winners of technological
   change and automation, but recent evidence shows that many
   higher-educated workers are, in fact, concerned about losing their jobs
   to technology. The reasons why higher-educated workers are worried about
   technological change are not yet clear, however. We analyse survey data
   from 25 countries to resolve this puzzle. Our results indicate, in a
   nutshell, that many higher-educated workers are concerned about being
   replaced by `artificial intelligence' (AI) and related technologies.
   Specifically, we find that perceived technological vulnerability among
   the higher-educated is strongly linked to working in the finance and IT
   sectors - which are known to be particularly heavily exposed to advances
   in AI technology. We discuss the implications of technological
   vulnerability among the higher-educated for social solidarity and
   political conflict in digitalizing economies.},

Abstract = {The article contains the results of preliminary comparative research on
   virtual communication conducted by ideologically populist right-wing
   parties in Poland and in France. The research was carried out using the
   method of discursive construction of dissatisfaction, analyzing content
   published on Facebook by the Confederation Liberty and Independence
   (Polish: Konfederacja Wolno \& sacute;\& cacute; i Niepodleg \& lstrok;o
   \& sacute;ci) and National Rally (French: Rassemblement National)
   parties. All posts published by the parties from December 1, 2023, to
   January 31, 2024, were examined (N-720). It was found that both parties
   built narratives that were negative and critical toward the created
   ``enemy,{''} as well as self-promotional narratives aimed at emphasizing
   the successes and achievements of the party and its leaders. Only
   incidentally there appeared posts in which parties proposed substantive,
   unique solutions, introducing them into the virtual political discourse.
   It was also established that the milieu has a key impact on the topic of
   virtual communication offered by each entity. Parties only address
   topics present in the national space and in a manner consistent with
   cultural values. However, they avoid topics that would not find a large
   enough audience. Management of virtual communication processes in the
   case of both parties is focused on achieving short-term goals, including
   achieving immediate political effects using communication on social
   media which play a key role in spreading information despite differences
   arising from the milieu where the narrative is provided.},

Title = {From rally to reality: unveiling long-term dynamics in political trust
   over two years of COVID-19 in Germany},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Crises like wars, terrorist attacks, and economic or health crises are
   frequently followed by profound changes in political trust. Whereas
   immediate external threats often induce a strong initial increase in
   political trust, the `rally-around-the-flag' effect, prolonged crises
   are more detrimental to this core feature of political support. We
   extend previous research on political trust during extended crises by
   using the case of the global Covid-19 pandemic. Employing
   individual-level panel data from Germany (N = 21,001, 2017-2022) and
   district-level data on infection rates and government-imposed
   restrictions, we distinguish time trends from both government action and
   crisis severity for various government and non-government actors such as
   media or corporations. Results from fixed-effects regression models
   reveal a prolonged increase in individual-level political trust
   throughout 2020 and early 2021, followed by a significant decline in
   2021/22. Contrary to extant work, we find limited influence of infection
   rates, whereas more stringent government policies explain decreasing
   trust later in the pandemic. These results are robust to including
   individual-level pandemic experiences like changes in work and family
   life. Thus, our results provide first evidence on the longevity of the
   initial rally effect in a high-trust country, which remains discernible
   at least one year into the pandemic.},

Title = {Who misses the bare necessities? Material deprivation as an indicator
   for egotropic economic voting},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 29},
Abstract = {There is strong empirical support for the theory of sociotropic economic
   voting, stating that voters decide which party to vote for based on
   their perception of the country's economic situation. There is less
   evidence, however, for the occurrence of egotropic economic voting,
   where electoral preferences are determined by individual economic
   circumstances. We argue that this lack of support is partly caused by
   the way in which personal economic evaluations have been measured thus
   far. A subjective question on financial satisfaction is not necessarily
   related to real life circumstances, and therefore we rely on less biased
   indicators of material deprivation (MD). Using the 7th wave of the World
   Values Survey, we find that subjective perceptions of one's financial
   situation are only weakly related to incumbent voting. Our new measure
   of MD, on the contrary, is significantly related to electoral support
   for the incumbent and therefore offers a better operationalization of
   egotropic economic voting.},

Title = {High-traffic relational pledge collection: results from a pre-registered
   randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 21},
Abstract = {A robust literature of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrates
   that personalized outreach from a trusted source is a powerful means of
   increasing the likelihood that someone will vote. However, it can be
   challenging to recruit sufficiently large numbers of mobilizers to scale
   up the tactic for broader use and to generate large impacts on overall
   turnout. This project explores the power of peer-to-peer reminders from
   friends. Canvassers used high-traffic locations, areas with high
   foot-traffic like college campuses, in four states (Arizona, Florida,
   Michigan, and North Carolina) to recruit mobilizers 3-14 weeks prior to
   the 2022 midterm elections. Mobilizers pledged to later reach out to up
   to five friends and remind them to vote during early voting or on
   election day. The get-out-the-vote (GOTV) intervention is to test if
   reminders to mobilizers measurably increase turnout among both recruited
   mobilizers and those they have pledged to remind to vote. We find
   negligible differences in turnout among either mobilizers or their
   friends. We conclude that sending these reminders is not an effective
   use of resources. Given the strength of peer-to-peer GOTV more
   generally, further research is needed to determine when site-based
   relational turnout tactics may be more effective.},

Title = {Vulnerability as identity facet: reconceptualizing vulnerability to
   conduct civically engaged research},
Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 20},
Abstract = {Civically engaged research offers significant potential to co-produce
   knowledge with systematically marginalized communities. However, the
   greater engagement with community partners as part of civically engaged
   research requires scholars to more deeply consider what vulnerability
   means in civically engaged research in an effort to minimize potential
   harm to community partners. We offer the vulnerability as identity facet
   (VIF) framework as a way to more deeply engage with the concept of
   vulnerability. In the VIF framework, we argue that vulnerability should
   be considered as a variable in its own right which varies by context and
   which requires reflexivity on the part of the scholar when evaluating
   risk with community partners. We demonstrate the utility of this view of
   vulnerability by applying the VIF framework to civically engaged
   research in natural disaster situations and in authoritarian contexts.
   In these examples, the VIF framework prompts additional methodological
   considerations and we lay out ways to enact this view of vulnerability.},

Title = {Explaining Interruption Behavior in Parliament: The Role of Topic
   Expertise, Career Status, and Government-Opposition Dynamics},
Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {66},

Abstract = {Why do politicians interrupt each other? Previous research has studied
   how personal characteristics of politicians, especially their gender,
   influence interruption behavior. However, we lack knowledge regarding
   how strategic incentives arising from political competition influence
   whether two politicians will interrupt each other. I argue that
   interruptions are a tool to disrupt the communication of other
   politicians, attack their public image, and boost one's own reputation.
   Based on strategic incentives, I expected three groups of factors to
   drive interruptions. First, politicians who are experts on the same
   topic should be more likely to interrupt each other. Second, career
   status could influence how likely new parliamentarians are to interrupt
   and how likely frontbenchers are to be interrupted. Third, opposition
   parties may use interruptions to attack members of government parties,
   whereas members of government parties should be least likely to
   interrupt their coalition partners. I used data on interruptions in the
   German Bundestag from 2017 to 2021, employing logistic and network
   regression models, and found support for shared topic expertise and
   government-opposition dynamics driving interruptions. New
   parliamentarians seem to be less likely to interrupt, but I found no
   robust evidence for an effect of frontbencher status. These findings
   enrich knowledge about the strategic role of interruptions in
   parliamentary communication and legislative behavior, demonstrating the
   roles of topic expertise and government-opposition dynamics in
   interruptions, which should not be disregarded in future studies.
   Warum unterbrechen sich Politiker:innen gegenseitig? Die bisherige
   Forschung untersucht, wie pers \& ouml;nliche Merkmale von
   Politiker:innen, insbesondere ihr Geschlecht, beeinflussen, wie oft sie
   unterbrechen und unterbrochen werden. Wir wissen allerdings nicht, wie
   strategische Anreize, die sich aus dem politischen Wettbewerb ergeben,
   die H \& auml;ufigkeit beeinflussen, mit der sich zwei bestimmte
   Politiker:innen gegenseitig unterbrechen. Ich argumentiere, dass
   Unterbrechungen ein Mittel sind, um die Kommunikation anderer Politiker
   zu st \& ouml;ren, ihr \& ouml;ffentliches Image anzugreifen und das
   eigene Ansehen zu steigern. Auf Grundlage strategischer Anreize erwarte
   ich, dass drei Gruppen von Faktoren Unterbrechungen im Parlament
   beinflussen. Erstens sollten Politiker:innen, die Experten:innen f \&
   uuml;r das gleiche Thema sind, sich wahrscheinlicher gegenseitig
   unterbrechen. Zweitens k \& ouml;nnte der Karrierestatus neue
   Politiker:innen dazu veranlassen, h \& auml;ufiger zu unterbrechen, und
   Mitglieder der Parteif \& uuml;hrung sollten wahrscheinlicher
   unterbrochen werden. Drittens k \& ouml;nnten Oppositionsparteien
   Unterbrechungen nutzen, um Mitglieder von Regierungsparteien
   anzugreifen, w \& auml;hrend Mitglieder von Regierungsparteien am
   wenigsten geneigt sein sollten, ihre Koalitionspartner zu unterbrechen.
   Ich verwende Daten zu Unterbrechungen im Deutschen Bundestag von 2017
   bis 2021 und logistische sowie Netzwerkregressionsmodelle. Ich finde
   Belege daf \& uuml;r, dass gemeinsame Themenexpertise und die Dynamik
   zwischen Regierung und Opposition die Wahrscheinlichkeit von
   Unterbrechungen beeinflussen. Neue Parlamentarier scheinen weniger h \&
   auml;ufig zu unterbrechen, w \& auml;hrend ich keine robusten Belege f
   \& uuml;r einen Effekt f \& uuml;r die Parteif \& uuml;hrung finde.
   Diese Ergebnisse bereichern den Kenntnisstand \& uuml;ber die
   strategische Rolle von Unterbrechungen f \& uuml;r die parlamentarische
   Kommunikation und das Gesetzgebungsverhalten, indem sie die Rolle von
   Themenexpertise und Regierungs-Oppositions-Dynamiken f \& uuml;r
   Unterbrechungen aufzeigen, zwei Faktoren, die in zuk \& uuml;nftigen
   Studien nicht vernachl \& auml;ssigt werden sollten.},

Abstract = {This Special Issue explores the causes, patterns and consequences of
   presidential activism, defined as the presidents' use of their formal
   powers and their attempts to influence politics through informal
   channels. Examining `going public' strategies, the influence exerted by
   presidents through informal and formal coordination mechanisms, links to
   political parties and foreign policy leadership, it argues that
   presidential activism shapes intra-executive relations, enabling
   presidents to wield influence beyond their constitutional powers.
   Presidential activism is facilitated by the presidents' popularity and
   role as head of state, particularly in less stable political contexts.
   These findings underline the need to investigate further various
   channels of presidential activism and how the citizens and media react
   to it, both during normal times and crises.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Month = {2024 DEC 18},
Abstract = {Text is a major medium of contemporary interpersonal communication but
   is difficult for social scientists to study unless they have significant
   resources or the skills to build their own research platform. In this
   paper, we introduce a cloud-based software solution to this problem:
   ReChat, an online research platform for conducting experimental and
   observational studies of live text conversations. We demonstrate ReChat
   by applying it to a specific phenomenon of interest to political
   scientists: conversations among co- partisans. We present results from
   two studies, focusing on (1) self-selection factors that make chat
   participants systematically unrepresentative and (2) a pre-registered
   analysis of loquaciousness that finds a significant association between
   speakers' ideological extremity and the amount they write in the chat.
   We conclude by discussing practical implications and advice for future
   practitioners of chat studies.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the impact of ChatGPT on student writing in
   the context of Model United Nations position papers, which require
   extensive research and concise articulation of policies on international
   issues. By comparing student-written papers and ChatGPT-generated
   papers, we find that whereas AI-generated papers received higher
   evaluations overall, award-winning student papers outperformed
   AI-generated papers. Furthermore, the quality of AI-generated writing is
   shown to depend on human input, emphasizing the importance of a
   human-centered approach to AI in education.},

Title = {Disagreement orientation: exploring disagreement orientation and its
   impact on political participation among Norwegian adolescents},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 14},
Abstract = {Participation in politics and democratic society involves handling
   disagreement and a diversity of opinions. However, research reveals that
   many citizens have a strained relationship with disagreement,
   particularly when they are political. This paper examines young people's
   orientation towards political disagreement and how such an disagreement
   orientation impacts political participation. Analysing data from an
   original survey of 531 Norwegian 15 year olds, this study demonstrates
   that disagreement orientation is multidimensional. More specifically,
   two distinct dimensions emerge as the most significant. The first is
   debate seeking, which encompasses positive emotions such as feelings of
   joy when debating opponents and actively participating in discussions.
   The second is conflict avoidance, characterised by negative emotions
   such as discomfort and concerns about social consequences. Furthermore,
   debate seeking and conflict avoidance emerge with distinct implications
   for various aspects of youths' political participation, where being
   positively oriented towards disagreement show positive impact on
   political interest and political conversation. Therefore, this paper
   argues for more attention to adolescents' disagreement orientation as
   multidimensional and for reflections on how this orientations influences
   political participation and political socialisation, for instance in the
   political classroom.},

Title = {Partisan Determinants of School Type-Specific Education Expenditures: A
   Comparative Analysis of the German Lander},
Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 9},
Abstract = {This study investigated the extent to which party politics influences
   the allocation of education spending across different school types at
   the level of the German states (Lander). Employing a Bayesian panel data
   analysis, the findings reveal that the party-political control of the
   Ministry of Education is decisive for the level of school-type-specific
   expenditures. Both clientele-related interests, as posited by the party
   difference theory, and ideological factors seem to play important roles.
   Parties representing constituencies with relatively low socioeconomic
   status tend to increase per-pupil expenditure across all school types
   more than parties representing higher socioeconomic status
   constituencies. This disparity is most pronounced in elementary schools
   (similar to (sic) 430 per year) and least pronounced in Gymnasiums
   (similar to (sic) 180 per year; Gymnasiums have the highest performance
   requirements of all secondary school types). As the Abitur (A-level)
   rate rises and access to higher education becomes more inclusive,
   parties with weaker socioeconomic constituencies further increase
   education spending, with the exception of Hauptschule and Realschule
   (which have the lowest and second highest secondary school performance
   requirements, respectively). This pattern suggests that sociopolitically
   left-leaning parties are more likely than their right-leaning
   counterparts to support a shift from a three-tier to a two-tier school
   system. In contrast, spending on Gymnasiums remains unaffected by the
   interaction between party politics and the Abitur rate. This indicates
   that its existence is largely uncontested across party lines.},

Abstract = {Can awarding migrants fewer legal rights than citizens ever be just?
   This paper explores this issue. I first outline an abstract argument in
   favor of rights differentiation. According to this argument, people's
   rights ought to track their independent claims; since these claims may
   vary, some rights differentiation is permissible. I then suggest that
   this argument threatens to undermine the institution of citizenship
   because citizens' claims on the state can differ in just the way
   migrants' claims can, and the rights of citizenship can be unbundled and
   awarded piecemeal. To resolve this tension, I offer a novel account of
   the normative functions of citizenship, which turns on the assertion
   that citizenship's public conferral of equal rights promotes status
   equality and confers equal recognition. This account sets firm bounds on
   rights differentiation without ruling it out entirely.},

Title = {Exporting autocrat's playbook? Diverging impacts of China and Russia on
   contemporary democratic backsliding},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 5},
Abstract = {The rise of illiberal powers, notably China and Russia, has stoked
   heated debates on their impact on democratic backsliding. However, the
   actual extent to which they undermine democratic governance in foreign
   countries remains contested. What roles do China and Russia play in
   contemporary backsliding? Under what conditions do they succeed or fail
   in spreading illiberal practices? China and Russia promote discrete
   illiberal practices in different places, but their efforts do not always
   succeed. While certain foreign policy strategies have effectively
   attracted and empowered like-minded foreign actors, others have
   obstructed political diffusion instead. We argue that the Chinese
   governance model of digital authoritarianism has increasingly spread to
   the periphery of the dominant international order after 2014. On the
   other hand, the Russian model of super-presidentialism, once prevalent
   in the former Soviet bloc, has experienced significant setbacks after
   2014, when Russia increasingly came to be perceived as a security
   threat. We present corroborating evidence through
   difference-in-differences analyses and additional validation using
   placebo tests. This research sheds light on the international dimensions
   of democratic backsliding and reconciles conflicting findings in the
   literature by identifying distinct Chinese and Russian models, as well
   as the conditions under which their diffusion succeeded or faltered.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {Multi-methods research designs typically focus either on developing or
   on testing pre-existing hypotheses. We outline a new methodological
   framework to combine hypothesis development and testing into a coherent
   and robust multi-method research design: the Multi-Stage Mixed-Methods
   Framework (MSMMF). The MSMMF is a novel approach to carefully sequence
   and combine different methods, such as machine learning (ML),
   practitioner engagement, inferential statistical analysis, qualitative
   comparative analysis, process-tracing and/or congruence analysis. We
   demonstrate that the MSMMF provides a holistic research design for
   developing and testing hypotheses, combining the strengths of existing
   mixed-methods approaches and embedding ML and the involvement of
   practitioners throughout the research process. We present the MSMMF's
   application to a theoretically challenging, empirically rich and
   policy-relevant question: Why do some peace processes bring an end to
   large-scale conflict-related violence while others do not?},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the reception of Adorno and Horkheimer's book
   Dialectic of Enlightenment in Chile, Argentina and Latin America. A
   bottom-up methodology is used to reconstruct the different ways in which
   the texts have been appropriated. The study of the Chilean case shows
   that such reception concentrates on the fragments that develop the
   concepts of enlightenment and mass culture, leaving aside other
   fragments of the book, which acquire a marginal character. It also shows
   that as the decades go by, this reception specializes and publishes in
   journals more than in books. The text then studies the reception of
   these marginal fragments in Latin America, showing that the only country
   where they are truly studied and used is Argentina. This is considered
   an indicator of a more complex, deep, and substantive than what occurs
   in other Latin American countries.},

Abstract = {This article examines the extent to which the ``Middle East conflict{''}
   affects the sense of security among Jews living in Germany. Drawing on
   the theoretical framework of political-cultural opportunity structures,
   we investigated whether the sense of security related to the ``Middle
   East conflict{''} depends on how open or closed these structures are
   perceived by those (potentially) affected. Our findings indicate that
   the more favorable the conditions for antisemitic mobilization appear,
   the more negatively the ``Middle East conflict{''} impacts the local
   Jewish community, due to the perception that antisemitic incidents are
   not adequately addressed and legally prosecuted. Using data from an
   online survey of Jews living in Germany (n = 295), we demonstrate that,
   in particular, the fear that public opinion toward Jews in Germany is
   closely linked to the so-called Middle East conflict contributes to a
   heightened sense of threat related to the conflict. Other statistically
   significant correlates concern distrust in the ability of courts and the
   media to respond appropriately to antisemitism.},

Abstract = {This paper casts light on the dialogue between political realism and
   John Rawls's political liberalism. I describe political realism on the
   basis of contemporary realist currents that attempt to render politics
   an autonomous sphere of human activity, largely through an investigation
   of sources of normativity apt for guiding political action. I elaborate
   on what points realists suggest they conflict with political liberalism,
   and identify three foundational similarities between the two approaches
   to the legitimation of political authority which should suggest that
   political realism ought to consider a consensus view of political
   legitimacy. First, both approaches to normative political theory emerged
   from the broader tradition of liberal philosophy. Second, both rest on
   the premise of a pluralistic society, which has certain normative
   implications. Third, both are attempts to justify the primacy of the
   political over the metaphysical. When considered together, these
   assumptions point to a demand for a theoretical inquiry into a consensus
   view of realist legitimacy.},

Abstract = {The Republic of Kosovo is a parliamentary republic that declared its
   independence on February 17, 2008. Currently, Kosovo is in the stage of
   institutional, political, and economic development and consolidation,
   and is strongly advancing toward the Euro-Atlantic integration process.
   States, in principle, within the domestic power they possess, have the
   right to regulate the procedures and requirements of acquiring and
   revoking citizenship, which can be considered as an element and
   instrument of the exercise of state sovereignty. However, states are
   generally careful when drafting legislation regarding citizenship to
   align their legal guidelines with important international instruments.
   The Council of Europe's Convention on Nationality, along with the Law on
   Citizenship of Kosovo and those of other states subject to comparison,
   are the subject of this paper. The new Law on Citizenship (which is
   currently in force) was approved in 2013. This law defines the
   modalities of acquisition, loss, and re-acquisition of citizenship of
   Kosovo and other issues related to citizenship. The main focus of this
   article is the correct definition and fair implementation of the
   procedures, criteria and requirements of the modalities for obtaining
   the citizenship of Kosovo through the Law on Citizenship of Kosovo and
   other related laws. Such an approach will contribute, no matter how
   little, in facilitating a fairer execution of the Law on Citizenship of
   Kosovo.},

   investigates the geoeconomic implications of China's Belt and Road
   Initiative (BRI) on long-standing US preeminence, using offensive
   realism as a theoretical lens. Based on an in-depth literature review
   and using a qualitative research approach, the authors examine Beijing's
   growing geoeconomic engagement with the HoA and its consequences for
   great power competition on the African continent. It examines the
   strengths and weaknesses of President Biden's Build Back Better World
   (B3W), a development initiative designed to counter China's BRI economic
   influence on the HoA. The study concludes that both the BRI and B3W
   initiatives and their implementation strategies demonstrate that both
   Beijing and Washington have strong national interests in the HoA
   regions, resulting in fierce geopolitical competition.},

Volume = {140},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {When scholars consider the relation between domestic political regimes
   and global climate change, they typically rely on assumptions about
   liberal democracy's core competencies with respect to environmental
   protection in general. As a result, an ostensibly normative debate
   pitting democracy against ``eco-authoritarianism{''} depends for its
   resolution on causal theory and empirical analysis. I offer an
   integrated assessment of both empirical (causal) and normative (ethical)
   theories on democracy, autocracy, and climate change, concluding that
   democracy's superiority is less compellingly supported than
   regime-neutrality. Theoretically, the causal logic of environmentally
   protective democracy cannot readily be extended to climate change as a
   distinctive political problem. Empirically, my review of global
   statistical analyses of regime type and climate change reveals that the
   evidence is more consistent with regime-neutrality than democratic
   advantage. Regime-neutrality, in turn, revitalizes difficult normative
   arguments about trade-offs between democratic freedom and climatic
   stability. Something resembling the ``win-win{''} situation of
   climate-fixing democracy may still be salvaged, theoretically. But
   political science's search for this outcome should take a realist turn:
   abandoning the liberal-authoritarian dichotomy in favor of a new one,
   pitting post-liberal forms of democracy against climate-fixing hybrid
   regimes.},

Abstract = {A startling feature of the countless recent sex scandals involving
   politicians has been the almost complete lack of public apologies. This
   note explores the electoral incentives politicians face when crafting
   communication strategies in the aftermath of sex scandals. We focus on
   two communication strategies - denials and apologies - and assess their
   impact on incumbent support across a wide range of scandals that vary in
   terms of the seriousness of the charges as well as the availability of
   evidence. Using data from a series of survey experiments, including over
   10,000 respondents we find that citizens punish incumbents who
   apologize, even in the case of accusations that appear the least serious
   in the eyes of voters. Moreover, apologies fail to generate political
   support compared to denials, even in cases when voters are exposed to
   evidence. This suggests that in most cases apologies are simply not
   politically viable communication strategies.},

Abstract = {What role can political institutions play in reconciling the demands of
   justice with the desire for happiness in diverse societies? The
   increased measurement and politicization of well-being in recent decades
   has left many multicultural democracies struggling to support their
   citizens' happiness while respecting the value of pluralism. Drawing on
   John Rawls's theories of social and developmental psychology, as well as
   empirical research on the social determinants of well-being, this paper
   develops a conceptual and normative framework for understanding and
   addressing this challenge. Conceptually, the paper describes how
   political institutions function as ``infrastructures of feeling{''} that
   shape the psychological dispositions and moral sensibilities of those
   living under them. Normatively, the paper argues that institutions
   reflecting Rawls's liberal egalitarian conception of justice are
   uniquely capable of supporting happiness while affirming pluralism. This
   ``experience-oriented egalitarianism{''} offers an original account of
   the connections between institutional design, public policy, moral
   psychology, and social justice, with direct implications for
   policymaking in multicultural democracies. The paper therefore concludes
   by offering several prescriptive recommendations for addressing the
   infrastructural origins of the ``happiness crises{''} emerging in many
   diverse societies.},

Abstract = {Studies have widely documented that women's descriptive representation
   in parliaments enhances their substantive representation. We probe this
   relationship under varying levels of women's collective and individual
   marginality based on an original dataset documenting the parliamentary
   behaviour of Israeli legislators over eleven parliamentary terms
   (1977-2015). Using several measures of individual-level marginality we
   show that marginalized female legislators are more prone to engage in
   gender-related parliamentary activity than their less marginal
   counterparts, albeit only under a certain threshold of women's
   marginality as a group. The article elucidates the dynamic nature of the
   relationship between descriptive and substantive representation of
   disadvantaged groups by demonstrating that it is contingent on their
   collective standing in parliament and on the marginality of individual
   legislators as manifested in their strategic choices.},

Abstract = {This article examines the manifestations, platforms and effect of fake
   news in Nigeria's 2019 presidential election. Data for the study were
   drawn mainly from primary sources, notably the administration of
   questionnaire on 1300 purposively selected respondents across the
   Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and the six-geopolitical zones of the
   country. A total of 1294 copies of the questionnaire were returned and
   analysed using descriptive statistics. The findings show that the
   majority of the respondents (86.8\%) actively engaged and consumed
   general news about the 2019 presidential election. Again, the majority
   of the respondents identified instances of fake news before, during and
   after the election across the traditional and new media, but higher in
   the latter. Fake news negatively affected the election in many ways,
   notably the promotion of hate speech and violence. The inability of the
   government, political parties and presidential candidates to adequately
   debunk and correct fake news complicated the problem.},

Abstract = {Court restructuring has become a salient national political issue, with
   proposals to increase the number of justices on the US Supreme Court
   gaining traction in response to various Court controversies. However,
   relatively little attention has been paid to state-level efforts, some
   successful, to increase the number of justices on state supreme courts.
   Although the number of justices on the US Supreme Court has not been
   changed since 1869, the size of most state supreme courts has been less
   stable. To place recent state supreme court expansions into context,
   this article analyzes the historical dynamics of state supreme court
   expansion. Analyzing an original dataset that includes every change made
   to the size of a state supreme court since 1789, it finds that court
   expansion has been more likely when the political competitiveness of a
   state is low and when state judicial selection and retention systems
   provide for lower levels of judicial independence.},

Abstract = {While Jean-Jacques Rousseau firmly defended the capacity of ordinary
   people to make good decisions for themselves, he did not view them as
   doing so naturally. In his view, they have to be educated and formed
   into citizens to be capable of sound decision making. But what is the
   nature of this education? For one prominent interpretive line, the
   Social Autonomy interpretation, the transformation occurs primarily
   through the education of reason. However, this article looks to an early
   draft of the Social Contract known as the Geneva Manuscript to argue
   that Rousseau views most people as narrowly self-interested and
   therefore in need of a passional transformation in order to make
   decisions based on the common good. People need their feelings expanded
   in order to agree to a good social contract. In the early draft,
   Rousseau considers a rationalist account of legitimacy and motivation
   made by his contemporary Denis Diderot but ultimately critiques and
   rejects it. This article traces the critique from the manuscript through
   to the final edition, emending the Social Autonomy interpretation, and
   further highlighting the necessity of emotional, extra-rational
   education in Rousseau's thought.},

Abstract = {We introduce a dynamic dataset of all communications by state election
   officials (EOs) on social media during the 2022 election cycle and
   develop metrics to assess the effectiveness of trust- building
   strategies on voter confidence. We employ quantitative manual content
   analysis of 10,000 organic posts from 118 state EOs' accounts on
   Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter between September 10 and November 30,
   2022, and code for the presence of variables that measure EOs' efforts
   to combat misinformation and build trusted networks of communications.
   The measures we present here address two questions: (1) How much
   coordination was there among states in terms of incorporating the
   \#TrustedInfo2022 campaign, promoted by the National Association of
   Secretaries of State, in their social media communications, and (2) How
   much of states' social media communications explicitly signaled that EOs
   are trusted sources of information? We demonstrate the applicability of
   our data on research that evaluates the impact of trust-building
   campaigns on voter confidence in elections, which is grounded on
   theories of deliberative democracy and democratic listening.},

Abstract = {Far-right parties present increased deportations and repatriations of
   `racial aliens' as a central policy goal. The mainstreaming of the
   far-right contributes to making such ideas enter mainstream politics and
   become legitimized. This article investigates what expansions of
   deportability can be discerned in relation to membership categories
   viewed as secure - notably, permanent residency and citizenship - in
   government policy and far-right policy proposals in Sweden. Based on an
   analysis of Swedish government policy documents from 1885 to 2022 and
   far-right party programs and policy proposals from 1989 to 2022, the
   article shows how government and far-right ideas have converged in
   recent years in part through the rekindling of historical policy. The
   article concludes that the mainstreaming of the far-right has
   contributed to a shift towards a conception of citizenship that aims to
   render a significant part of the Swedish population deportable.},

Abstract = {The term `Arms Race' describes the Cold War's intricate geostrategic
   landscape, wherein the United States and Soviet Union were the principal
   contenders. The New Arms Race, in which China and the USA are major
   players, demonstrates the shifting dynamics of the global geostrategic
   landscape and symbolizes the current global geostrategic environment.
   This study, therefore, investigates the intricacies of the emerging
   Sino-U.S. arms race and how Xi Jinping's foreign policy and the Chinese
   dream of national rejuvenation influence China's military modernization.
   Considering China's recent military modernization, how has the US
   adapted its military modernization and strategic outlook to contain
   China? Furthermore, this study assesses President Trump's and Biden's
   diverse strategic outlooks in their approaches to China's military
   advancement and the geopolitical implications of the Sino-US Arms Race
   for global security and strategic stability. Moreover, this study
   highlights that a new bipolar world order analogous to the Cold War is
   emerging. The escalating New Arms Race will not only alter the regional
   balance of power but also encourage higher defense spending and
   strategic partnerships among like-minded nations, with consequences for
   the global arms control architecture.},

Abstract = {Populist parties have been increasingly successful in European politics
   over the last decade. Although research suggests that nostalgic
   deprivation - a perceived loss of economic, political or social status -
   is linked to support for populist parties, the generalizability of this
   argument across voters and national contexts remains unclear. In this
   research note, we leverage original representative surveys across 19
   European countries to demonstrate that perceptions of declining status
   are a consistent predictor of populist support. Decomposing nostalgic
   deprivation into different dimensions, we find that while social,
   economic and power deprivation have different antecedents, each predicts
   populist attitudes and voting behaviour. Moreover, we find that
   nostalgic deprivation predicts support for populist platforms among both
   left-wing and right-wing respondents, as well as across Eastern and
   Western Europe. While the antecedents differ across contexts, these
   findings confirm that perceptions of downward mobility are associated
   with the rise of populism in Europe.},

Abstract = {In some countries, all subnational units have the ``right of legislative
   initiative{''} the shared rule arrangements. However, despite equal
   opportunities within the try, regions demonstrate enormous differences
   in their legislative activity. Based calculation of the number of
   regional legislative initiatives for the period 2001-2020 Russia and
   some other European countries (Italy, Spain, Germany, and Switzerland),
   we examine the impact of the specificity of individual regions, which is
   a consequence of the territorial heterogeneity of the country, on their
   activity in national ing. Employing OLS regression analysis, we find
   that the distinctiveness of a terms of its geography, economy, and
   history generates special political interests positively influences
   their activity in national lawmaking both in Russia and European
   countries.},

Journal = {ANACRONISMO E IRRUPCION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {25},
Month = {NOV-APR},
Abstract = {The present article explores the question of the best political regime
   in the chapters 1 and 2 of Aristotle's Fourth Book of the Politics. In
   relation to this textual segment, it is argued that it displays a
   conception of political science that offers different approximations to
   that evaluative question, and that these perspectives boost an expanded
   understanding of Aristotelian typology of constitutions. According to
   this interpretation, it is plausible to see the structure and internal
   division of Aristotle's political treatise though the prism of an
   explicative intention that, empirically sustained, opens up to a
   morphological analysis of the various constitutional forms without
   disregarding, at the same time, an equally flexible normative
   orientation.},

Abstract = {When do public policies influence citizens' political attitudes and
   behavior, and among whom? We study this question using one of the
   largest social provision programs in the United States: the Earned
   Income Tax Credit (EITC). We exploit the staggered roll-out of
   state-level EITC programs to estimate the causal effect of the program
   on elections, voter behavior, and attitudes about the government.
   Contrary to predictions from the policy feedback literature, we show
   that the credit leads to higher vote shares and approval ratings for the
   implementing governor. These effects are temporally limited to the first
   years of the credit's availability and dissipate over time. Taken
   together, our results offer new insights about the conditions under
   which particularistic economic policies affect political outcomes.},

Abstract = {This article joins the nascent literature exploring the nexus of
   consociational power-sharing and militant democracy. While the two ideas
   appear to be different answers to different challenges, the respective
   empirical research agendas have been converging with militant democratic
   scholarship's increasing interest in ethnically and religiously divided
   societies. Besides analysing the relationship between the two concepts,
   the article reviews the militant democratic provisions in various
   contemporary consociations, with a particular focus on Northern Ireland,
   the jurisdiction with the most explicit arrangements on restrictive
   measures protecting its democratic procedures. Given the similarities
   between the Northern Irish arrangement and the European Union's
   procedures allowing the suspension of member states in the European
   Council, as well as its partially consociational features, the article
   also stresses the question whether the experience of Northern Ireland
   can offer any lessons for proponents of militant democracy in the EU. In
   the latter regard, the analysis suggests that the consociational
   experience can prove the most useful concerning the articulation of
   norms and arrangements on the arbitrational bodies. Nevertheless, this
   explorative comparative research also invites further contributions to
   this field of research, especially on the contextual analysis of
   individual cases.},

Abstract = {B \& eacute;la Tuka started his career as a Hungarian academic, but
   later he transformed into a Slovak nationalist politician, and renamed
   himself Vojtech Tuka. In 1939, he became the prime minister of the
   Nazi-oriented Slovak State. This study intends to reveal, how national
   narratives struggled to interpret this life path. After national
   explanations of trespassing the cultural boundaries between Slovak and
   Hungarian national identity did not prove to be coherent and convincing,
   the memory of Vojtech Tuka has been disregarded by both (opposing)
   national groups, mutually, since it questions the organic existence of
   nations and their boundaries.},

Abstract = {The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine raised for many parties the
   question of how to position themselves in view of urgently requested
   arms deliveries. Since, the topic of arms trade, which has hitherto
   rarely been addressed, has become a heavily politicized and divisive
   issue and partly even polarized public opinion. A major prerequisite for
   parties' position-taking is to anticipate how voters react to such arms
   transfers and, more specifically, whether their respective attitudes are
   structured along the predominant left-right axis. Based on a large-scale
   survey experiment with French and German voters ( \$N = 6617\$ ) in the
   year before the Russian invasion, we are able to focus on the
   relationship between ideological predispositions, vote intentions, and
   issue attitudes in a non-politicized period. Using both vignette and
   conjoint experiments, we demonstrate that voters' attitudes on military
   transfers can be subsumed remarkably well under the left-right scale.
   Differentiating the impact of normative and economic considerations, the
   former is stronger among the left, while the latter also affects the
   attitudes of rightist citizens. However, normative considerations are
   the most important concern along the whole political spectrum. The turn
   of the German Green Party in 2022 to assist countries that are being
   aggressively attacked (because of the Responsibility to Protect), was
   not reflected in our data.},

Journal = {NATIONAL IDENTITIES},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the responses of the Finnish and Scandinavian
   writers' associations to a National Socialist cultural diplomatic
   initiative, namely the German-Nordic Writers' House. Doing so, it
   engages the interplay between popular culture and foreign politics, as
   Nordic writers negotiated how to respond to the Third Reich's quest for
   European cultural hegemony. Using the Writers' House as a case study,
   the article discusses the nebulous nature of cultural diplomacy and
   reflects on how responses to the Writers' House, especially in Finland,
   elucidate the limits of National Socialist cultural diplomacy in its
   engagement with the conflict-ridden Nordic cultural fields in the 1930s.},

Title = {May's Law in changing times-an empirical assessment of the German case},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 15},
Abstract = {Is May's Law empirically valid? There is a recently growing, but still
   insufficient, body of research that suggests otherwise. While the
   so-called ``non-leaders{''} of a political party (e.g. voters) indeed
   tend to hold more moderate policy preferences than its ``sub-leaders{''}
   (e.g. active party members), when it comes to higher party ranks, May's
   idea of a curvilinear intraparty opinion structure is not well
   supported, as a party's ``top-leaders{''} (e.g. elected officials)
   rarely hold more moderate policy-views than the respective sub-leaders.
   Using data from the German Party Membership Studies of 1998, 2009 and
   2017, we add a new case to the few studies on complex party systems that
   brings its own peculiarities, such as a usually strong internal party
   socialisation process of top-leaders. We use one of the most
   comprehensive data sets available for investigating May's Law. It
   enables us to avoid common problems, such as insufficient observations
   in a given echelon or heterogeneous survey dates and items for varying
   strata (e.g. van Holsteyn et al. 2017). In line with previous research,
   we show that May's Law should by no means be considered a law, as we
   confirm the generally more radical positioning of top-leaders. With an
   increase in intraparty democracy, the frequency of curvilinear disparity
   has decreased even further: Leaders have become more aligned with
   sub-leaders in this process, but not with the non-leaders. While the
   aforementioned findings are not affected by the specific
   operationalisation, we demonstrate how the chosen understanding and
   operationalisation of radicalism, as a key component of May's ideas, is
   crucial for measuring intraparty opinion structures.},

Abstract = {NATO is facing a doctrinally contradictory defence posture in the Baltic
   States, as those countries are investing in a static defence line even
   while Western militaries adhere to manoeuvrist operational approaches.
   Lukas Milevski argues that political imperatives and tactical conditions
   make static defence more appropriate than manoeuvre warfare.
   Politically, NATO's policy of defending every inch and the Baltic
   experience of Russian occupation require forward defence. Second, the
   Russian border will always stop offensive manoeuvre. Tactically, the
   increasing difficulty of crossing the battlefield intact improves the
   chances of tactical defence and throws doubt upon the necessity of
   defensive operational manoeuvre.},

Abstract = {Silvio Berlusconi's political life and legacy have left a profound and
   lasting imprint on Italian politics. Not only as prime minister but also
   as the leader of his party, he shaped at least two decades of Italian
   politics. With an `eccentric' leadership style, Berlusconi approached
   the roles of party and government leadership in an entirely novel
   manner. This special issue on the Political Life and Times of Berlusconi
   deepens our understanding of his significant role in Italian political
   history. Each article examines a different aspect of his multifaceted
   leadership, and addresses the challenges of studying a figure as complex
   and divisive as Berlusconi, who dominated Italian politics for three
   decades.},

Abstract = {After 78 years of democracy, Italy continues to grapple with its recent
   past in the political, social, and cultural spheres. Its experience of
   fascism under Mussolini, its dual participation in the Second World War,
   and the continuous and still existent connections between the
   ideological factions of the 1930s-1940s and now render the country a
   rich case for the study of public history and memory. The specificity of
   these characteristics has often made Italian history and memory look
   like an outlier, shaped by circumstances difficult to compare with those
   of other countries'. This paper argues that contemporary Italian memory
   politics are in reality a valuable source of information about the kind
   of mnemonic discourses that may arise in other (Western) European
   countries, given the increasingly polarised and populist European
   landscape. Our study of discourses put forwarded by the post-fascist
   party Fratelli d'Italia reveals a set of mnemonic tools with which they
   successfully banalise fascism and chip at Italian public discourse
   slowly but surely. The comparison between this discourse and that of VOX
   and AfD in Spain and Germany, respectively, shows that these tools,
   ranging from nativism to policy (de)legitimation linked to fascist
   imagery, has started to transfer to other countries' political
   strategies.},

Month = {2024 OCT 2},
Abstract = {While most of the literature on public opinion has explored how
   motivated reasoning makes some individuals discredit survey results in
   advanced industrial democracies like the U.S., few studies have
   considered how voters perceive electoral polling in young democracies
   like Mexico. This study included a survey experiment that found that
   voters perceived polls that matched their partisan preferences as more
   credible. Moreover, voters were requested to provide an estimate of
   candidates' vote intention. The results highlight that voters' partisan
   bias - not lack of information, prior expectations or low levels of
   interest - makes them overestimate their co-partisan candidate's vote
   intention. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of
   the conditions that make some voters interpret political events through
   a partisan lens. Voters choose interpretations that rationalize their
   partisan predispositions even in young democracies, where partisanship
   is commonly perceived to be weak.},

Abstract = {Crises of the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic may plausibly affect
   deep-seated attitudes of a large fraction of citizens. In particular,
   outcome-oriented theories imply that leaders' performance in response to
   such adverse events shapes people's views about the government and about
   democracy. To assess these causal linkages empirically, we use a
   preregistered survey experiment covering 12 countries and 22,500
   respondents during the pandemic. Our design enables us to leverage
   exogenous variation in evaluations of policies and leaders with an
   instrumental variables strategy. We find that people use information on
   both health and economic performance when evaluating the government. In
   turn, dissatisfaction with the government decreases satisfaction with
   how democracy works, but it does not increase support for nondemocratic
   alternatives. The results suggest that comparatively bad government
   performance mainly spurs internal critiques of democracy.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with the relationship between the organized feminist
   movement and legislative solutions adopted in the United Kingdom and the
   United States ofAmerica unified by their common law tradition. The
   women's movement in the historical sense consisted of three waves that
   individually and in their totality aimed to improve and revitalize
   women's rights. The paper exclusively analyses the legal-historical
   context of origin and development and the legal consequences of the
   first wave. Its goal was the realization of formal legal equality for
   women and men. Consequently, the paper is composed oftwo units that
   chronologically follow the development of legislative solutions in the
   selected countries. Furthermore, the specific circumstances of the
   social order immanent in those climates are taken into account. Special
   emphasis is placed on the question of acquiring the right to vote as the
   ultimate constitutional and political right, and thus on all the
   historical circumstances that led to its realization. The concluding
   considerations provide a comparative presentation of the specificities
   of two Anglo-Saxon legal orders and their manifestations. Also, the
   previously presented social circumstances are correlated with economic
   and legal arrangements.},

Abstract = {This research focuses on providing a new perspective from which to
   examine the dogmatic-criminal response in cyber incidents where the
   affected information is recoverable by backup. For this purpose, the
   crime of sabotage against computer data will be analysed, in accordance
   with Article 264.1 of the Spanish Criminal Code reformed by Organic Law
   1/2015, in attention to community legislative reforms in criminal and
   cybersecurity matters. In addition, various doctrine and case law
   perspectives will be explored. As it will be demonstrated in this work,
   the recoverability of the material object of the crime turns the factual
   assumption described into an atypical case. Likewise, in situations of
   total or partial loss of information, the criminal reaction will only be
   justified if the typical element of double severity is met, as a result
   of the restrictive interpretative sense embodied in the legal text and
   the criminal policy of the European Union on cybercrime.},

Abstract = {Understanding how and why the frequency of terrorist attacks can change
   is clearly a critical issue and an increasing amount of research has
   focused on this subject. This article presents the results of a Rapid
   Evidence Assessment (REA) of research published from 2012 to 2022 on
   this area. A total of 50 articles were identified which met the review's
   criteria thresholds. Thematic analysis identified eight core themes
   across the research which affected the frequency of terrorist attacks:
   Regime Type and Domestic Politics; Economic factors; Military
   Intervention and Foreign Fighters; Migration; Climate Change and Natural
   Disasters; Terrorist Organisational Qualities; Terrorist Target
   Selection Practices; and Media Coverage. The article also considers the
   research methods used across the studies and, in particular, reflects on
   the heavy reliance placed on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD).
   Potential implications in terms of policy as well as recommended avenues
   for future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {The main conclusions of two classical theories of justice can be
   represented as solutions to a decision making problem. Rawls' second
   principle of justice is a result of applying the maximin criterion for
   decision-making behind the `veil of ignorance'. The utilitarian
   principle of maximizing average utility, meanwhile, can be traced back
   to applying the Laplace criterion of decision making behind the veil of
   ignorance. This article makes explicit the different assumptions about
   preference measurement and assumptions about interpersonal comparisons
   of utility that need to be made to use either of these principles. Once
   these assumptions are made explicit, it becomes clear that the choice
   between theories of justice cannot be exclusively settled by an exchange
   of arguments for one kind of distributional arrangement over the other,
   but is also a question of what kind of measurement assumptions are more
   plausible in a given context.},

Abstract = {In the IR literature, devoting attention to small state exceptionalism
   remains the exception. This paper aims to rectify this situation by
   analyzing claims of exceptionality of the successive Orb \& aacute;n
   governments of Hungary. It aims to shed light on Hungary's foreign
   policy by making two core claims. First, based on a diverse range of
   sources, it shows that successive Hungarian governments have
   increasingly come to conceptualize Hungary as an exceptional,
   trail-blazing, model country in foreign policy and beyond, especially
   after 2018. Secondly, the paper shows how claims of exceptionality can
   lead to resentment and isolation in foreign policy, if and when they go
   hand-in-hand with collective narcissism.},

Title = {The economic roots of cross-national similarity in voter preferences},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 9},
Abstract = {We argue that economic and political integration leads voters' political
   preferences toward cross-national convergence. Analyzing data on voter
   preferences across 30 European democracies from 1976 to 2022, we measure
   the similarity of preference distributions across state dyads over time,
   documenting an average increase in similarity over this period. We then
   model these associations statistically and find that greater similarity
   and complementarity in economic production and co-participation in the
   European Union and the Eurozone are associated with increasingly similar
   voter preferences. The argument and analyses broaden our understanding
   of the political implications of globalization and also provide a
   theoretical and empirical foundation for two growing literatures: one on
   the cross-national diffusion of parties' strategies and one on the
   political implications of macroeconomic stimuli such as trade shocks or
   banking crises.},

Abstract = {Long before Americans become eligible voters, they have key experiences
   that influence their propensity to engage in politics. Experiences
   within K-12 public schools may convey messages to students about their
   roles as citizens while also conferring essential resources necessary
   for political participation. This paper seeks to understand how school
   racial compositions affected nonwhite students long-term, in this case,
   their levels of political participation. I hypothesize that while
   nonwhite students in predominantly white schools receive better
   resources, they are also likely to have worse social experiences
   compared to comparable students in majority-minority schools. Using the
   1988 National Education Longitudinal Study and the Education
   Longitudinal Study of 2002, I find that attending a predominantly white
   high school is associated with more negative school experiences and
   higher resources for students of color in 1988, but not 2002. Resources
   and experiences are countervailing mechanisms that pull political
   participation in opposite directions but change over time. Overall,
   during peak school integration, attending a predominantly white high
   school is associated with lower levels of political participation for
   students of color.},

Abstract = {Reformers assert that lobbyists take advantage of legislators who lack
   adequate staffing and research to win policy outcomes for their interest
   group clients. However, in the United States, legislators usually
   determine their own levels of staff. This paper exploits the 1990
   passage of California's Proposition 140 to test a situation when the
   legislature's capacity dropped. Proposition 140 immediately lowered
   legislative expenditures for the 1991-1992 session by 38\%, which
   decimated the policy staff, particularly in the state's Assembly. Using
   bill analyses that identify which outside groups served as the source of
   legislation, we shows that group sponsored bills became more likely to
   pass than non-group bills in the wake of Proposition 140. This effect is
   concentrated in bills introduced in the Assembly. We account for other
   factors that could explain this relationship, particularly direct and
   indirect effects of the term limits wrought by Proposition 140, but find
   they did not alter legislator relationships with outside groups.},

Abstract = {This article surveys how neorepublicanism can address a recent
   criticism: that it fails to identify and redress structural forms of
   domination (i.e., not easily traceable to dominating agents). I argue
   that neorepublican `basic liberties' may outline policy responses to
   what critics consider structural domination. Then I examine the
   neorepublican account of social structure as an incidental facilitator
   of domination, offering two interpretations: as `structurally produced
   agent-level domination,' and as `structural risk of agent-level
   domination.' I conclude that, when it comes to dealing with structural
   domination, neorepublicans fall into the same presumption against state
   interference they hold against liberals and libertarians.},

Abstract = {In times of crisis, citizens tend to increase their approval of the
   government and its leader which can shift the balance of power. This
   `rally effect' is a persistent empirical regularity; however, the
   literature is still undecided on its underlying causal mechanisms. We
   argue that crises induce threat and anxiety and hypothesize that
   perceived threat increases approval of the incumbent leader, whereas
   anxiety decreases it. By analysing German panel data from the COVID-19
   pandemic, we causally identify both mechanisms and provide systematic
   evidence supporting this theory. Moreover, we increase the scope of our
   theory and show that both mechanisms are also at work when citizens
   approve cabinet members who manage key portfolios. Our findings have
   highly important implications for our understanding of the rally effect
   and crises politics in democracies.},

Abstract = {Since the agreement of the Millennium Development Goals, many of the
   international community's foremost stabilisation efforts have
   unravelled, with cascading instability afflicting neighboring states.
   Multiple governments and political entities have begun to turn away from
   long-term Western security partnerships, and realign with actors such as
   Russia. This realignment has been pursued even though Russia's offer
   often appears poorer in objective terms. Jack Watling and Nina Wil \&

Abstract = {This article provides an alternative, sexual reinterpretation of
   Machiavelli's Mandragola from an alternative sexual perspective focusing
   on sodomy (in its sixteenth-century meaning), and especially male-male
   sexuality. In this reading, Messer Nicia is, put in today's terms, a
   homosexual and, at the same time, surprisingly enough, the key, princely
   character in the play. Dri ven by a desire to establish a new, less
   oppressive familial order, Nicia is able to renew his corrupted family
   by means of a conspiracy aimed at liberating Lucrezia's sexuality from
   the restraints of the dominant morality. Mandragola constitutes an
   intrinsic part of Machiavelli's political project, showing how the
   explosion of sexual desire beyond the confines of dominant
   heteronormative morality can serve as a productive way of expressing
   plebeian desire not to be oppressed and commanded by the great, which
   proves beneficial to all. Keywords: (the) Great, Machiavelli,
   Mandragola, Sexuality, Plebs, Prince},

Abstract = {Legislators face a challenge when implementing long-termist policies
   that prioritise sustainability and the well-being of future generations:
   citizens prefer policies that pay off sooner rather than later. In this
   research note, I assess the hypothesis that the lifespan structures this
   temporal discounting effect. Do people show a particular preference for
   policies that pay off within, rather than beyond, their own lifetime? In
   a pre-registered conjoint analysis with age-group blocking (N = 2405), I
   find little evidence in support of this explanation. Although they
   significantly prefer nearer-term policy benefits, citizens show no sign
   of especially preferring policies whose benefits will materialise within
   their own lifetimes. This pattern holds across a range of personal,
   political and philosophical differences. The temporal discounting effect
   is also substantially smaller than other policy features, such as how
   large the payoff of that policy is expected to be. Additionally, people
   are clearly willing in principle to trade off the timing of benefits for
   the scale of benefits, preferring larger later payoffs to sooner smaller
   ones. Across and beyond the lifespan, the sooner a policy pays off, the
   better. But, whenever they materialise, the bigger the societal benefits
   of that policy, the better. These findings strongly suggest that
   temporal policy discounting is not driven by selfish concerns, while
   also reinforcing that any such effect does not overwhelm citizens'
   evaluations of policy proposals in principle.},

Abstract = {The research note examines the causes, methods, and manifestations of
   promoting and defending Catholic and broader Christian values in
   Poland's foreign policy from the end of 2015 to 2023. First, I summarize
   the essential religious issues in Poland's foreign policy after 1989.
   Second, I explore the ``diplomacy of values{''} of Law and Justice,
   which positioned itself as a defender of Christianity and Christians
   worldwide. Using the example of foreign aid, I demonstrate the increased
   significance of religion in Poland's external activity. Finally, I
   discuss the reasons for the ``religious turn{''} in Poland in the
   international and national dimensions.},

Abstract = {Debates about the moral and ethical implications of using artificial
   intelligence (AI) abound. Yet, AI is swiftly being embedded into many
   aspects of society, becoming a key tool for sharing and gaining new
   knowledge. Benefitting from a systematic methodology that has led to the
   generation of profiles on all US states and territories in ChatGPT, as
   well as interviews with 17 experts on state-level politics, this article
   provides insights for those wishing to understand the value of tools
   such as ChatGPT for political research generally, and for state and
   territory level US politics specifically. It demonstrates that
   generative AI cannot yet produce robust politically oriented content.
   Scores given by experts for different aspects of the ChatGPT-generated
   profiles suggest it is somewhat better suited to accurately capturing
   the history of states as opposed to contemporary politics or insights
   that can be garnered from academic literature. The findings further
   highlight the often vague nature of sources provided by ChatGPT, and
   detail other inaccuracies in sourcing and content. This article
   demonstrates that at present, ChatGPT cannot serve as a meaningful
   resource for students and scholars of US state and territorial politics
   and that these findings are likely robust for other types of political
   research},

Abstract = {Omar Al-Bashir's thirty-year rule over Sudan ended in April 2019 with a
   military coup following a popular uprising. Subsequently, the army and
   civilian political forces agreed on an African Union-mediated
   transitional framework. However, the transitional process collapsed,
   leading to an all-out civil war between the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and
   Rapid Support Forces (RSF) since April 2023. One year later, the
   mediation efforts by different actors have not yielded the expected
   results. As the war continues, the displacement of people and the
   destruction of infrastructure is increasing.The paper discusses the
   reasons for the lack of progress in the ongoing mediation and points out
   critical aspects regarding the prospect of peace in Sudan. It argues
   that while the need for a ceasefire is essential, it is important to
   acknowledge that the current conflict is the culmination of the overall
   failure of nation-building. To avoid past mistakes and break the cycle
   of violent conflict in Sudan, the ongoing mediation efforts should be
   able to pave the way for a long-term peacebuilding process to address
   the root causes of the protracted conflict and redefine the fundamentals
   of Sudan as a nation-state.},

   MPs' attitudes toward gender equality},
Journal = {LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study analyzes whether the personality traits of Members of
   Parliament (MPs) affect their attitudes toward the representation of
   gender equality issues. Based on the Big Five personality traits, we
   argue that Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness shape MPs'
   positions toward gender equality policies through two different
   pathways. The first pathway proposes a direct connection. While Openness
   is expected to positively affect MPs' support for gender equality,
   Conscientiousness is assumed to have a negative impact. The second
   pathway runs indirectly, linking Openness and Conscientiousness to
   preferences toward gender equality through the effect of these
   personality traits on MPs' general ideological positions. Using data
   from a survey of elite politicians in Germany and Switzerland, the
   results of a causal mediation analysis show a positive direct effect of
   Openness that holds independent of a mediating influence of political
   ideology. The analysis deepens our understanding of gender equality
   legislation and the MPs engaging in it.},

Abstract = {A long-standing debate in political psychology considers whether
   individuals update their beliefs and attitudes in the direction of
   evidence or grow more confident in their convictions when confronted
   with counter-attitudinal arguments. Though recent studies have shown
   that instances of the latter tendency, which scholars have termed
   attitude polarization and ``belief backfire,{''} are rarely observed in
   settings involving hot-button issues or viral misinformation, we know
   surprisingly little about how participants respond to information
   targeting deeply held attitudes, a key condition for triggering attitude
   polarization. We develop a tailored experimental design that measures
   participants' core issue positions and exposes them to personalized
   counter-attitudinal information using the large language model GPT-3. We
   find credible evidence of attitude polarization, but only when arguments
   are contentious and vitriolic. For lower valence counter-attitudinal
   arguments, attitude polarization is not detected. We conclude by
   discussing implications for the study of political cognition and the
   measurement of attitudes.},

Abstract = {The UK state has been through many periods of perceived crisis, but the
   instability of the last decade has shaken some of the foundational
   institutions of British politics. Our main argument is that the rise of
   political instability relates to the failure of British politics to
   respond to structural inequality in society and politics. This includes
   growing economic and geographic disparities, as well as destabilizing
   divisions over long-standing social injustices. The infusion of these
   trends into the political process is the subject of the `asymmetric
   power model (APM)', which acts as the theoretical underpinning of this
   paper and the special issue it introduces. In this editorial to the
   Parliamentary Affairs Special Issue on `Instability and inequality in
   the British state', we elaborate these arguments and provide a brief
   overview of the eight papers in the issue, which cover the APM, the
   constitution, the UK Union, the Conservative Party, public policymaking,
   gender inequalities, intersectional inequalities, and geographical
   inequalities. Together, the papers identify the causes and features of
   the UK's troubling inequality-instability dialectic and offer various
   practical and theoretical ways forward.},

Abstract = {Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been substantial
   scholarly interest in the roles of women in leadership positions. This
   multiple-case study explores the experiences of female political leaders
   during the pandemic, focusing on their roles, challenges, and
   resilience. The study encompasses ten women political leaders actively
   involved in pandemic-related activities in Dumingag, Zamboanga del Sur,
   Philippines. The findings indicate that these women embodied exceptional
   compassion and courage in their efforts to curb the virus's spread
   within their communities. The research underscores that the attributes
   traditionally associated with femininity, such as empathy and nurturing,
   were beneficial during the pandemic. Rather than posing a challenge,
   femininity complemented their leadership roles, with the main obstacles
   being the risk of contracting COVID-19 and public skepticism regarding
   the pandemic's seriousness. The study highlights that these female
   leaders adeptly managed the pandemic's challenges through effective
   cooperation and collaboration with stakeholders, underpinned by a
   commitment to altruism. This research contributes to the field by
   demonstrating that the qualities associated with female leadership can
   enhance crisis management. It informs the international debate on gender
   and leadership, suggesting that women's distinctive attributes may be
   particularly advantageous in navigating global health emergencies. By
   emphasizing these contributions, the study advocates for a broader
   recognition of the value of female leadership in crisis situations and
   encourages further examination of gender dynamics in leadership roles
   globally.},

Journal = {SCOTTISH AFFAIRS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {33},

Pages = {311-331},

Abstract = {Richard Demarco has long been a prominent figure in the Scottish
   cultural sphere. He has been a significant cultural progenitor, raising
   the profile of the visual arts within Scotland. In his long cultural
   life he has often come into conflict with Scotland's cultural
   `officialdom' and is a strident critic of the present-day Edinburgh
   Festival and Fringe. This article examines Demarco the public
   intellectual, often overshadowed by Demarco the provocative, hyperbolic
   showman. It identifies and contextualises Demarco's abiding themes,
   locating them in a belief that art has a unique ability to heal personal
   and societal wounds. It goes on to examine whether his `declinist'
   dismissal of much contemporary culture stems from an elitist disdain and
   whether his cultural vision is nostalgic and narrow. The article also
   examines Demarco's critiques of both commercialism and state-supported
   cultural institutions. It argues that underneath the public persona
   there lies a unique and challenging cultural vision; one which will
   survive after his rich cultural life ends.},

Abstract = {This qualitative study explores the efforts of the Sumenep District
   government in developing community-based ecotourism, focusing on the
   potential of marine tourism and small islands on Madura Island. Despite
   the commitment to promoting ecotourism through branding initiatives such
   as the tagline ``Sumenep: The Soul of Madura{''} and the slogan ``Golden
   Triangle Islands{''} highlighting Gili Iyang, Gili Labak, and Gili
   Genting several challenges hinder progress. These include unequal
   tourist distribution among the islands, inadequate infrastructure and
   accommodation, poor coordination in tourism management, and inefficient
   resource utilization. The research aims to describe and analyze
   governmental efforts, identify potential ecotourism types, uncover
   obstacles preventing optimal development, and propose a development
   model for community-based ecotourism. Findings indicate that significant
   gaps in infrastructure and management must be addressed to leverage the
   islands' ecotourism potential effectively. The study concludes that a
   comprehensive strategy, including robust regulatory frameworks, is
   essential to ensure sustainable and protected ecotourism in the Golden
   Triangle Islands, ultimately benefiting local communities and preserving
   natural resources.},

Abstract = {Drawing from the literature on political ambition, this article examines
   whether politicians holding executive offices exhibit similar patterns
   of movement between different levels of government as parliamentary
   elites. It also tests the influence of various institutional and
   political variables typical of federal systems. Focusing on Spain, the
   study classifies career movements based on the initial position and the
   direction of advancement, analyzing their variations depending on the
   availability, accessibility, and attractiveness of the structure of
   opportunities. The article particularly aims to elucidate why certain
   regions are more advantaged to provide decision-makers with more
   opportunities to circulate across political layers. Our sample includes
   cabinet members (prime ministers and ministers) and regional chief
   executives in Spanish regions from 1980 to 2021. The findings suggest
   that the status of regions, the availability of parliamentary seats, and
   the regional party system, among other factors, contribute to
   understanding regional variations in opportunities for executive
   level-hoppers.},

Abstract = {Silvio Berlusconi's legacy in Italian politics has been considerable and
   widely studied. However, did Forza Italia's leader change Italy's
   foreign policy as dramatically as he changed domestic politics? What
   legacy, if any, has Berlusconi left in international politics? In this
   article, I will argue that Berlusconi left a distinctive although not
   enduring legacy in Italian foreign policy, initiating a populist,
   nationalist and revisionist course that partially disrupted Italy's
   traditional diplomatic stance and foreshadowed a number of global
   trends. Berlusconi's impact on international affairs, however, goes
   beyond his record as diplomat. Berlusconi provided a template, or model,
   that leaders worldwide widely emulated, helping to set the stage for
   populists everywhere. The combination of short-lived policy changes and
   long-lasting shifts in political attitudes constitute Berlusconi's
   complex legacy in international politics.},

Abstract = {In separation of powers systems, in theory, legislative and executive
   branches must concur for policies to be enacted. However, empirical
   research, especially on Latin American cases, suggests that rather than
   reaching a compromise, it is common for the executive to make unilateral
   decisions, leaving the legislature marginalized in the policymaking
   process. Contrary to this trend, I argue that understanding important
   policy choices, including the national budget, requires considering the
   formal powers assigned to the president and the assembly, in interaction
   with their ideological divergence. Examining 12 presidential democracies
   for the past 20 years, I investigate the legislative majority's success
   in determining government expenditures under various policymaking
   institutions. I identify a number of institutional scenarios where
   legislative majorities are highly likely to succeed, while in other
   configurations, their success depends on their ideological divergence
   from the president.},

   Multiparty Legislatures},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {77},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1333-1349},

Abstract = {This study delves into the determinants of legislative overrides in
   multiparty legislatures, with a specific focus on the influence of
   partisan fragmentation within congress. Utilizing an original dataset
   spanning from 1995 to 2017, we examine the cases of Ecuador and Peru.
   Our argument posits that during lawmaking, a dispersed and fragmented
   party system prevents the president from anticipating the preferences of
   the congressional pivotal party. In such a scenario of incomplete
   information, the president's capacity to introduce selective incentives
   through vetoes is limited. In this way, the president is less likely to
   break the congressional majority supporting a bill. Consequently, the
   vetoed bill becomes less acceptable compared to the original statute.
   This, in turn, provides the congressional majority with increased
   incentives to uphold the original bill, elevating the likelihood of a
   legislative override. In alignment with this rationale, our findings
   indicate that an increase in the effective number of parties (ENP) has a
   positive and significant impact on the probability of a legislative
   override. Additionally, our evidence underscores a noteworthy contrast
   between the relatively high rate of legislative overrides in Latin
   America and findings for the US case.},

Abstract = {School Refusal Behavior (SRB), characterized by a child's reluctance to
   attend school or stay in school for a full day, is particularly
   prevalent during adolescence. Using the network approach, this study
   examined the roles of family and school factors in adolescents' SRB. We
   surveyed 2,218 Chinese adolescents (Mage = 16.36 years, SD = 0.95 years;
   40.97\% females), who provided reports on SRB, both maternal and
   paternal parenting styles, and adaptive and maladaptive school outcomes.
   The results showed a 27.4\% rate of SRB. Correlations existed between
   parenting style, adaptive and maladaptive school outcomes, and
   adolescent SRB. Network analysis documented that among school and family
   factors, attitudes toward school and academic adjustment had the highest
   bridging centrality in connecting to SRB. The findings suggest that
   future research and intervention efforts may prioritize students'
   negative attitudes toward school and academic adaptation as key
   strategies for reducing SRB in adolescents.},

Abstract = {This article examines the uses of the words populism(s) and
   populist(s)-hereafter populis{*}-by Members of Parliaments from Belgium,
   France, and Spain in 2019. It presents noteworthy findings unexplored in
   the literature on the uses of populis{*}. First, when employed by MPs,
   populis{*} refers mainly to actions, discourses and elusive threats
   rather than directly blaming political enemies (except in Spain).
   Second, in the three focal countries, populis{*} is mainly used
   pejoratively by right and centre-right MPs as a strategy implemented to
   disqualify political projects and discourses deemed nationalist,
   demagogical, and extremist. The originality of our study lies in
   demonstrating similar trends in Belgium, France, and Spain, while also
   unveiling differences stemming from national contexts.},

Abstract = {Influential theories doubt that partisan television's audience is
   sufficiently large, moderate, or isolated from cross-cutting sources for
   it to meaningfully influence public opinion. However, limitations of
   survey-based television consumption measures leave these questions
   unresolved. We argue that nonpolitical attributes of partisan channels
   can attract voters to form habits for watching channels with slants they
   do not fully share. We report findings from three novel datasets which
   each link behavioral measures of television consumption to political
   administrative or survey data. We find that approximately 15\% of
   Americans consume over 8 hours/month of partisan television.
   Additionally, weak partisans, independents, and outpartisans comprise
   over half of partisan channels' audiences. Finally, partisan television
   consumers largely consume only one partisan channel and remain loyal to
   it over time, consistent with ``echo chambers.{''} These findings
   support our argument and suggest partisan television's potential to
   influence public opinion cannot be dismissed.},

Title = {Turning to the radical right: Examining subnational variation in radical
   right support after ethnic minority success in East Central Europe},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {90},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The radical right party family is the fastest growing party family in
   Europe. Initial research centered on East Central Europe has shown that
   radical right parties receive higher levels of support in reaction to
   the success of parties that support ethnic minorities. However, the
   strength of radical right parties can vary considerably within a
   country. This paper breaks new ground by investigating the subnational
   factors in ethnically diverse East Central European countries that
   contribute to the vote share that a radical right party receives within
   a community. We test hypotheses drawn from the literature on ethnic
   competition, economic deprivation, and institutional constraints using
   an original dataset to explore subnational variation in support for
   radical right parties in national elections since 2000 in Bulgaria,
   Romania, and Slovakia. Our research yields two main findings about
   countries with politically mobilized ethnic minority communities: First,
   radical right support is lower in ethnically diverse subnational units,
   and second, radical right support increases after ethnic minority
   parties have been in government in subnational units which experienced
   economic decline relative to other subnational units.},

Abstract = {Presidential term-limit evasion (TLE) is inconsistent with international
   human rights, and researchers have linked the practice to democratic
   backsliding. Yet, this practice has much to uncover, including how
   different TLE tactics (constitutional court ruling, legislative change,
   referendum) influence electoral integrity. We expect the increase in the
   incumbent advantage and the imbalance in the separation of powers
   obtained through TLE to affect the integrity of the subsequent elections
   in which the evading leader is running. To test this, we analyse an
   original dataset of 414 presidential terms in 63 African and Latin
   American countries (1988-2019), using mixed-effects models to
   investigate each tactic's effect on different electoral measures,
   including overall quality perception, Electoral Management Body
   Autonomy, election day irregularities, vote buying, and intimidation. We
   confirm our expectations, further finding that the court mode
   specifically consistently precedes the worst effects on electoral
   quality, EMB Autonomy, irregularities, intimidation, and voter registry
   accuracy.},

Abstract = {This paper clarifies the mysteries surrounding the alleged Chinese New
   Left as an intellectual movement since the 1990s and explains why the
   term Chinese New Left mismatches with what it seemingly refers to. In
   fact, as an intellectual movement, the alleged Chinese New Left is an
   artificial construction of distorted and incoherent referentiality,
   which has no commonality with the New Left in its original sense.
   Notwithstanding, as possible and marginal space in the political
   spectrum and public sphere, a New Left could exist in China, though
   illegally by far.},

Abstract = {The US federal bureaucracy contains 7 women's policy machineries: The
   White House Gender Policy Council, the Center for Women Veterans, the
   Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, the Office of
   Global Women's Issues at the Department of State, the Office on Women's
   Health at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Office on
   Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice, and the Women's
   Bureau at the Department of Labor. Together these offices provide a
   broad, shared commitment to advancing women's interests, but they vary
   greatly in terms of their missions, activities, constituencies served,
   organizational structure, forms of authorization, and levels of
   collaboration with political actors inside and outside of government.
   Recognizing the variation in American women's policy machineries, this
   paper provides a proposed empirical framework for how scholars can begin
   to document the variation in American WPMs and analyze how effectively
   each WPM implements gender equality policies and empowers American
   women. The first section defines WPMs. The second section proposes the
   research question, data sources, and methods for a future study of
   American WPMs. The conclusion discusses the implications adding this
   proposed study to the broader comparative literature on WPMs.},

Abstract = {The right to know is fundamental to a democratic society as it empowers
   citizens to participate in public debate and shape policy. Several
   countries have adopted freedom of information laws to regulate the
   exercise of that fundamental right. However, the right of access to
   information is yet to be vigorously acknowledged as a constitutional
   right in many countries. The article places the idea of human rights in
   historical perspective, determines the link between rights and
   information and public participation in political life. It presents
   arguments for including right to information (RTI) as a fundamental
   human right based on international and regional instruments and court
   decisions and examines the state of RTI in selected South Asian
   countries where RTI laws have been in place for a while. However, much
   more remains to be done to foster a culture of transparency and make RTI
   stand on its own as a fundamental human right.},

Abstract = {In May 2023, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley announced
   the withdrawal of his officers from attending mental health emergencies,
   under the new policy Right Care, Right Person (RCRP). In some sense, the
   move highlights that the police role and remit is not a settled,
   immovable social fact, and as such, this development, in some limited
   sense, lends support to the `defund the police' argument. However,
   defunding done properly requires more than simply withdrawing personnel
   from a procedural response to an emergency. The article argues that this
   potentially transformative moment must be capitalised on through an
   holistic approach to harm prevention-one which seriously demotes police
   involvement in favour of investment in non-punitive visions of care in
   order to make for a truly safer society.},

Abstract = {The alt-right imposed itself as a rapidly expanding political phenomenon
   at the beginning of the 21st century, positioning itself as the central
   axis of American white nationalist thought and distinguishing itself
   from the currents of thought that prevailed within the American right.
   However, as happened at its birth, its demise was just as rapid as its
   emergence, as a consequence of two events: the Charlottesville incident
   in 2017 and the occupation of the U.S. Congress in 2021. This paper will
   attempt to explain the rise and fall of the alt-right, the currents of
   thought by which it has been influenced, from paleoconservatism to
   right-libertarianism, focusing on ideas such as those of Hans Hermann
   Hoppe. On the other hand, it will analyze how the alt-right differs from
   the most popular currents of the ``Trumpist{''} right, such as Breitbart
   or Infowars, distinguishing itself by its academic tone and its
   intention to reflect a deep intellectual rigor.},

Abstract = {Individuals who participate more in politics tend to be better
   represented politically. As a result, it is important to examine which
   groups are more and which groups are less likely to participate. In this
   paper, we study the institutional and non-institutional political
   participation of an important group that has only received scant
   attention in the literature: sexual minorities. To do so, we leverage
   recent datasets and conduct the first comprehensive study on the
   relationship between sexual orientation and non-electoral political
   participation in Canada. Consistent with our theoretical expectations,
   the analyses reveal that sexual minorities (n = 2061) participate to a
   greater extent in politics compared to heterosexuals (n = 23,652), even
   after controlling for numerous socioeconomic factors. We also find that
   the sexuality gap is similar across gender identities. We conclude by
   discussing the implications of our findings for the comparative
   literature on sexuality and politics.},

Abstract = {In June 2021, Eric Adams - a former captain of the New York City Police
   Department - won the Democratic mayoral primary for the city of New York
   with 30.7\% of the vote. Adams' candidate profile struck many as unique
   - a Black man, he paradoxically represented a liberal yet tough-on-crime
   approach. In this paper, we analyze how tough-on-crime candidates'
   identities impact their favorability among progressive voters. We focus
   on both race (e.g., Black vs white candidates) and gender (e.g., female
   vs male candidates). Building on literature regarding stereotypes,
   perceived policy competency, and expectations among progressive voters,
   we hypothesize that tough-on-crime candidates will be less favorable to
   Democratic voters, but this will depend on candidate identity. We expect
   both Black and/or female tough-on-crime candidates to experience less
   pushback for tough-on-crime stances compared to their white and/or male
   counterparts. We test these expectations via a conjoint experiment
   included in an original, nationally representative survey of U.S.
   adults. Our results support the idea that Democrats punish
   tough-on-crime candidates, but this effect is conditional on candidate
   identity. Namely, Democratic Black candidates are not strongly punished
   for being tough-on-crime. Unexpectedly, we find that female Democratic
   candidates experience more electoral penalty than their male
   counterparts when taking tough-on-crime positions.},

Abstract = {In 2015, the UK government placed teachers in England and Wales at the
   forefront of efforts to prevent radicalisation in young people.
   Radicalisation as a concept is complex and confusing, and addressing it
   in schools may be perceived as controversial. This article investigates
   how secondary school teachers and Prevent practitioners across England
   understand the concept of radicalisation in education and the impact of
   the Prevent Duty on teachers' professional role. Both groups are public
   service officials who work with or within secondary schools under
   different capacities. Thirteen teachers and fourteen Prevent
   practitioners were interviewed using semi-structured interviews,
   allowing for in-depth discussions. A thematic analysis approach was used
   to analyse and organise the data. The findings highlight discrepancies
   between teachers' and Prevent practitioners' understanding of
   radicalisation, due to different levels of knowledge, job expertise,
   personal interest, media exposure and training. This inquiry sheds light
   on how teachers' and Prevent practitioners' conceptualisation of
   radicalisation impacts the way they understand and comply with state
   policy - in this case, the Prevent Duty, within education.},

Abstract = {Recent research has documented a significant and rising presence of
   corporations in politics. In this letter, we ask to what extent
   corporations in Denmark have increased their political activity and
   access to political arenas during the last two decades. The analysis
   draws on two surveys among large corporations conducted in 2001 and
   2022. This allows us to compare the extent to which corporations use
   tactics such as targeting the news media as well as their reported
   levels of contact to public authorities. We find that corporations today
   are engaged in broader questions and use a wider set of strategies than
   around the turn of the century, but also that their contacts to public
   administrative authorities have decreased and that a larger share of
   corporations are only active through collective organisations. This
   provides an important corrective to the existing image of a uniform rise
   in the political activities of private corporations.},

Abstract = {The rise in populism and movements that threaten trust in science and
   expertise has been labeled a post-truth world. What challenges does this
   environment present for higher education, and how should it respond?
   This article examines the characteristics of a post-truth world and how
   that challenges the fundamental purposes of higher education. It then
   examines how higher education might respond, what risks come with that
   response, and how effectively it might resist attempts to attack and
   undermine its different purposes. These movements undermine
   possibilities for truth or objective knowledge, presenting a clear
   threat to higher education. Its response focuses around improving
   research and communication with the public, but the nature of cognitive
   processes in a polarized world leads people to discount information that
   does not fit with their existing worldviews and values. Simply providing
   better research will not solve the problem, and actively engaging with
   these movements can make higher education seem more partisan, further
   reducing trust. In the face of such intractable problems, it is
   important for higher education to also nurture communities with its
   students that foster trust and ``critical loyalty{''} to knowledge and
   truth over falsehoods and conspiracy.},

Abstract = {Social democratic parties have undergone a transformative ideological
   and electoral shift. But how has this affected their alliance with trade
   unions in terms of personal ties? This article hypothesises that Social
   democratic parties appoint fewer union-linked ministers as they become
   more economically centrist and less dependent on working-class voters.
   However, institutions that stabilise party-union relations should
   moderate these effects (statutory linkages, high union density, or union
   involvement in policymaking). Data on 2,600 ministerial appointments in
   Western Europe show that there is no direct relationship between trade
   unionist appointments and changes in party electorates or party
   ideology. However, electoral change is correlated with appointment
   patterns when institutional stabilisers are weak. Thus, social democrats
   weaken their elite ties to unions in response to the middle-class shift
   in their electorates, but only when the institutional context is
   unfavourable for the party-union relationship.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes Kazakh-European trade and economic relations from
   2012 to 2021, aiming to elucidate the dynamics, trends, and strategic
   implications of these bilateral interactions. The primary purpose of
   this research is to scrutinize the dynamics of Kazakhstan's trade and
   economic interactions with European countries, assessing the trends,
   challenges, and opportunities within this framework. Employing a
   methodology that combines analysis and synthesis, inductive and
   deductive reasoning, and statistical methods including ABC analysis in
   MS Excel, the study provides a comprehensive examination of Kazakhstan's
   trade volumes, exports, imports, and foreign direct investments with
   European countries. It was revealed that for the countries of Europe,
   the indicators of the volume of trade, exports, and imports, gross
   investments showed a greater drop than in the economy. Summarized
   information characterizing the institutional aspect of the formation of
   relations between Kazakhstan and European states highlights Kazakhstan's
   active participation in international organizations as a key driver in
   developing these relationships. The findings offer valuable insights for
   policymakers and business stakeholders, highlighting the need for
   strategic approaches in optimizing trade and investment relations
   between Kazakhstan and Europe.},

Abstract = {Amidst the pressing global energy transition, nations strive to shift
   from fossil fuels to renewables, grappling with environmental urgency
   and complex energy security challenges. This article explores the
   multifaceted impact of geopolitical tensions, including the
   Russia-Ukraine conflict and Middle Eastern instability, on energy
   security and the global green transformation. It discusses how these
   conflicts have triggered both short-term reliance on fossil fuels and a
   renewed drive toward sustainable energy independence. Moreover, it
   delves into Europe's Green Deal, China's technological advancements, and
   the United States return to the Paris Agreement as transformative steps,
   all underscoring the need for robust international cooperation. This
   in-depth analysis highlights the strategies, obstacles, and global
   collaborations essential for achieving a resilient and sustainable
   energy future},

Abstract = {In this article, we analyze how the operation of the Russian Aerospace
   forces is presented in the official Russian discourse. The analysis is
   based on a collected database of statements made by the Russian
   authorities. Relying on social identity theory, we argue that the
   Russian operation in Syria became a key element in changing the Russian
   strategy in the Middle East. In other words, beginning in the mid-2010s,
   Russian policy in the Middle East moved from social competition to
   social creativity. Taking the Russian operation in Syria as an example,
   we assert that the second half of 2017 was a turning point because the
   military narration of the discourse was replaced at that point with the
   narration of the unique role of Russia in the regulation of the Syrian
   conflict. This narration included narratives related to `sovereignty',
   `territorial integrity', and the creation of alternative platforms to
   maintain stability.},

Abstract = {Although the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the USA
   and the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada have
   elicited considerable domestic contestation in Europe, several other
   agreements have been negotiated into public and media indifference. What
   explains this difference? In this article, I put forward a number of
   arguments on the structural causes of the politicization of European
   Union (EU) trade policy over the past 30 years and test them against a
   newly collected dataset covering 19 preferential trade agreements. The
   qualitative comparative analysis suggests that the politicization of EU
   trade negotiations is determined by the co-occurrence of several,
   well-defined conditions. More specifically, it tells us that: (1) the
   Lisbon Treaty's reform of EU trade policymaking is the main driver of
   politicization, (2) the level of public support for the EU is of
   particular relevance when it comes to `deep and comprehensive'
   agreements that touch on sensitive domestic issues, and that (3) high
   adjustment costs expected from trade liberalization can lead to the
   politicization of trade negotiations.},

Abstract = {We leverage plausibly exogenous variation in regional exposure to
   corruption to provide causal estimates of the impact of local political
   corruption on terrorist activity for a sample of 175 countries between
   1970 and 2018. We find that higher levels of corruption lead to more
   terrorism. This result is robust to a variety of empirical
   modifications, including various ways in which we probe the validity of
   our instrumental variables approach. We also show that corruption
   adversely affects the provision of public goods and undermines
   counter-terrorism capacity. Thus, our empirical findings are consistent
   with predictions from a game-theoretical representation of terrorism,
   according to which corruption makes terrorism relatively more attractive
   compared to peaceful contestation, while also decreasing the costs of
   organizing and carrying out terrorist attacks.},

Abstract = {This article is the first comprehensive treatment of countermajoritarian
   roll call outcomes in the U.S. Senate, 1789-2022. Divergences from
   majoritarian principles are rooted in part in malapportionment and equal
   representation by state. Roll calls where a majority of the chamber
   votes one way while the other side represents most of the U.S.
   population are frequent across Senate history, depending on the
   proportion of the population covered by the majority party and the
   degree of conflict in the agenda. Other departures from majoritarian
   principles derive from the presence of supermajority requirements within
   the chamber. Such decision thresholds likewise are prevalent across
   Senate history, with significant increases since the 1970s. Although the
   two sources of countermajoritarian potential tend to be mutually
   reinforcing, under certain conditions they work against one another. The
   partisan impact varies over time, but in the modern chamber, Republicans
   have benefited more from Senate countermajoritarianism than have
   Democrats.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the ways in which power relations structure
   urban public space and privilege certain behaviors, while marginalizing
   others, and how these structures are resisted by young people through
   the creation of alternative spaces on the city's rooftops. It examines
   the activity of ``roofing{''} in St. Petersburg, a popular youth-culture
   practice of urban exploration, investigating the factors that have
   enabled the widespread flourishing of this activity, despite its
   illegality. The article explores how the rooftops offer a distinctive
   realm for the youth in modern-day St. Petersburg to defy authority;
   reestablish their rights to the city; and counteract the escalating
   social, economic, and political control that has come to define Russia's
   public sphere during Putin's reign.},

Abstract = {Identifying racial disparities in policy and politics is a pressing area
   of research within the United States. Where early work made use of
   identifying potentially noisy correlations between county or precinct
   demographics and election outcomes, the advent of Bayesian Improved
   Surname Geocoding (BISG) vastly improved estimation of race by employing
   voter lists. Machine Learning (ML)-modified BISG in turn offers accuracy
   gains over the static - and potentially outdated - surname dictionaries
   present in traditional BISG. However, the extent to which ML might
   substantively alter the policy and political implications of
   redistricting is unclear given its improvements in voter race
   estimation. Therefore, we ascertain the potential gains of ML-modified
   BISG in improving the estimation of race for the purpose of
   redistricting majority-minority districts. We evaluate an ML-modified
   BISG program against traditional BISG estimates in correctly estimating
   the race of voters for creating majority-minority congressional
   districts within North Carolina and Georgia, and in state assembly
   districts in Wisconsin. Our results demonstrate that ML-modified BISG
   offers substantive gains over traditional BISG, especially in diverse
   political geographic units. Further, we find meaningful improvements in
   accuracy when estimating majority-minority district racial composition.
   We conclude with recommendations on when and how to use the two methods,
   in addition how to ensure transparency and confidence in BISG-related
   research.},

Abstract = {Understanding which political candidates are elected for office is
   fundamental to democracy and political science. Whereas there is much
   agreement that party affiliation is one of the most important candidate
   characteristics to voters, evidence regarding the gender and race of the
   candidate is mixed. We suggest voters have lexicographic preferences,
   meaning they rank their preferences and focus primarily on the
   candidate's party affiliation. Second-order preferences such as gender
   and race are mostly necessary when there is a tie in first-order
   preferences when voters choose between two same-party candidates or have
   no party information. We show how conjoint experiments can be used to
   test for lexicographic preferences and use data from a US-representative
   sample and a pre-registered replication to confirm that in the United
   States, gender and race are second-order preferences. Lexicographic
   preferences provide a theoretical lens explaining some of the mixed
   results of gender and race in the candidate literature.},

Abstract = {The parliamentary oversight of the European Central Bank (ECB) is
   frequently criticised for its lack of focus in both monetary policy and
   banking supervision. While Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) can
   publicly question ECB decisions in these fields, they often use
   committee hearings for other purposes, such as expressing political
   positions on issues that may or may not be related to ECB activities.
   This article aims to conceptualise such variation by expanding the
   seminal distinction between `police patrols' and `fire alarms' to
   include two novel categories - `planning bureaus' and `ambulance
   chasers'. To illustrate the applicability of our typology, the article
   provides the first systematic comparison of the Monetary and the Banking
   Dialogues (2014-2021), combining a qualitative content analysis of 1,504
   parliamentary questions with insights from interviews with MEPs. The
   findings highlight the pervasiveness of fire alarms and ambulance
   chasing in the parliamentary practice of overseeing the ECB.},

Abstract = {This short article offers a practical introduction to archival research
   for political scientists working on European politics. Archival
   documents are increasingly recognized as a relevant data source for
   process tracing analyses in small-N or mixed methods studies. Previously
   classified archival documents are exceptionally trustworthy due to their
   original confidentiality. Their rich and detailed content facilitates
   the understanding of causal mechanisms. Still, the hurdles for working
   with archival sources are high for political scientists. Lack of
   experience, no special training in handling historic documents, and a
   shortage of textbooks meeting their demands are a few of the problems
   political scientists planning archival research face. In the article, I
   highlight the opportunities of archival research and demonstrate how
   challenges can be overcome. I emphasize that the archival field trip
   should only be planned once researchers have gained substantive context
   knowledge. In their preparation, researchers should use all the
   resources archives offer and develop measurable expectations from
   theories.},

Abstract = {The climate crisis looms but support for fuel taxation is low. How to
   boost support? The obvious way is to make the connection to the climate
   crisis explicit. Many observers fear, however, that policy myopia
   renders this strategy ineffective: As the consequences of the climate
   crisis are long-term and insecure, people are loath to pay for costly
   countermeasures in the short term. We look at policy distraction as a
   second potential drag. We argue that climate crisis-induced support for
   fuel taxation can also be undermined by other salient events which
   divert attention. To test our argument, we conduct a large-scale survey
   experiment with more than 21,000 respondents in 17 European countries.
   Our results show that a simple climate crisis prime raises support for
   fuel taxation by 12 percentage points. The effect decreases but remains
   substantial when stressing the long time horizon of the climate crisis.
   It almost disappears when other current crises (COVID-19 and Russian
   military aggression) are mentioned. Thus, distraction by concurrent
   events is a serious impediment to mobilising support for fuel taxation.},

Title = {Centripetalism in Consociational Democracy: The Multiple Proportional
   Vote and the Belgian Case},
Journal = {SWISS POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Belgium illustrates that using consociational institutions in divided
   societies may ensure a peaceful political environment, but it fails in
   reducing its centrifugal tendencies. As communitarian issues threaten to
   paralyse the political debate, preserving the efficiency of the state
   will require adding centripetal incentives to the consociational
   framework. However, the solution usually proposed for this purpose -the
   creation of a federal constituency- would be insufficient and would
   raise legitimacy problems analogous to those occurred in Bosnia, the
   Swiss Canton of Berne or Cyprus. Instead, this paper advocates the
   adoption of a new electoral system: the Multiple Proportional Vote
   (MPV). MPV can maintain the consociational goal of including the
   different communities in the parliament, as well as to strengthen the
   centripetal trends towards moderation. Indeed, electors of every group
   are allowed to cast their preferences for candidates of the other
   communities. As such, MPV suggests that consociationalism and its main
   theoretical alternative, centripetalism, are far from mutually
   exclusive.
   Belgien ist ein Beispiel daf \& uuml;r, dass konsoziative Institutionen
   in gespaltenen Gesellschaften zwar ein friedliches politisches Umfeld
   gew \& auml;hrleisten k \& ouml;nnen, aber nicht in der Lage sind,
   zentrifugale Tendenzen einzud \& auml;mmen. W \& auml;hrend
   Gemeinschaftsfragen die politische Debatte zu l \& auml;hmen drohen,
   erfordert die Erhaltung der staatlichen Effizienz, dass der konsoziative
   Rahmen um zentripetale Anreize erg \& auml;nzt wird. Die zu diesem Zweck
   \& uuml;blicherweise vorgeschlagene L \& ouml;sung - ein f \&
   ouml;deraler Wahlkreis - w \& auml;re jedoch unzureichend und w \&
   uuml;rde \& auml;hnliche Legitimit \& auml;tsprobleme aufwerfen wie in
   Bosnien, dem Schweizer Kanton Bern oder Zypern. Stattdessen wird in
   diesem Dokument die Einf \& uuml;hrung eines neuen Wahlsystems bef \&
   uuml;rwortet: die Mehrfachproporzwahl (MPV). Das MPV h \& auml;lt an dem
   konsoziativen Ziel fest, die verschiedenen Gemeinschaften in das
   Parlament einzubeziehen, und verst \& auml;rkt die zentripetalen
   Tendenzen in Richtung M \& auml;ss igung, indem es den W \& auml;hlern
   jeder Gruppe erlaubt, ihre Pr \& auml;ferenzen f \& uuml;r die
   Kandidaten der anderen Gemeinschaften auszudr \& uuml;cken. So legt die
   MPV nahe, dass sich der Konsozialismus und ihre wichtigste theoretische
   Alternative, der Zentripetalismus, keineswegs gegenseitig ausschlie ss
   en.
   La Belgique illustre le fait que les institutions consociatives dans les
   soci \& eacute;t \& eacute;s divis \& eacute;es peuvent garantir un
   environnement politique pacifique, mais ne parviennent pas \& agrave; r
   \& eacute;duire les tendances centrifuges. La pr \& eacute;servation de
   l'efficacit \& eacute; de l'\& Eacute;tat n \& eacute;cessite l'ajout
   d'incitants centrip \& egrave;tes au cadre consociatif. Comme la
   solution habituellement propos \& eacute;e \& agrave; cette fin - une
   circonscription f \& eacute;d \& eacute;rale - est insuffisante et soul
   \& egrave;ve des probl \& egrave;mes de l \& eacute;gitimit \& eacute;
   analogues \& agrave; ceux rencontr \& eacute;s en Bosnie, dans le canton
   suisse de Berne ou \& agrave; Chypre, cet article pr \& eacute;conise
   l'adoption d'un nouveau syst \& egrave;me \& eacute;lectoral: le vote
   proportionnel multiple (MPV). Le MPV maintient l'objectif consociatif
   d'inclure les diff \& eacute;rentes communaut \& eacute;s dans le
   parlement et renforce les tendances centrip \& egrave;tes en permettant
   aux \& eacute;lecteurs de chaque groupe d'exprimer leurs pr \& eacute;f
   \& eacute;rences pour les candidats des autres communaut \& eacute;s. Le
   MPV sugg \& egrave;re ainsi que le consociationalisme et sa principale
   alternative th \& eacute;orique, le centrip \& eacute;talisme, ne
   s'excluent pas mutuellement.
   Il caso del Belgio dimostra che le istituzioni consociative in societ \&
   agrave; divise possono garantire un ambiente politico pacifico ma non
   riescono a ridurre le tendenze centrifughe. Visto che le questioni
   comunitarie minacciano di paralizzare il dibattito politico, occorre che
   il quadro consociativo sia completato con incentivi centripeti, di modo
   che lo Stato possa continuare a funzionare in modo efficace. Dato che la
   soluzione solitamente proposta a questo fine - una circoscrizione
   federale - risulta insufficiente e solleva dei problemi di legittimit \&
   agrave; analoghi a quelli riscontrati in Bosnia, nel cantone di Berna in
   Svizzera o a Cipro, questo articolo propone l'adozione di un nuovo
   sistema elettorale in Belgio: il voto proporzionale multiplo (VPM). Il
   VPM mantiene l'obiettivo consociativo di includere le differenti comunit
   \& agrave; in parlamento ma rinforza le tendenze centripete permettendo
   agli elettori di ogni gruppo di esprimere le loro preferenze per tutti i
   candidati delle altre comunit \& agrave;. Grazie al VPM il
   consociativismo e la sua principale alternativa teorica, il
   centripetalismo, non si escludono vicendevolmente.},

   energy cooperatives in Europe},

Abstract = {Energy communities are integral to achieving the European goal of carbon
   neutrality by 2050. While these communities are currently being
   emphasized as strictly place-based, with some states interpreting RED
   II's proximity criterion stringently, our research offers a contrasting
   perspective: We argue that a sole focus on geographical proximity fails
   to capture the full contributions of energy community projects,
   especially those that function as communities of interest rather than
   merely as communities of place. In order to support this perspective,
   our study analyses data from 5402 responses and 31 semi-structured
   interviews from two main energy cooperatives: Ecopower in Flanders,
   Belgium, and \& egrave;nostra in Italy, in both of which, members are
   not confined by geographical boundaries and are instead united by shared
   energy-related interests.Our findings indicate that these two
   organizations are pivotal to driving the European energy transition. The
   organizations effectively rally their members around a common identity,
   thereby fostering new norms, practices, and forms of social capital as
   well as offering a shield against the market's prevailing logic. This
   observation becomes even clearer when considering the fact that the
   cooperatives have reached a significant level of business maturity, with
   Ecopower utilizing more resources for including and empowering
   participants and territories. Our research underscores the importance of
   re-evaluating the role of geographical proximity in energy policies and
   highlights the potential that interest-based cooperatives have when it
   comes to advancing sustainable energy initiatives across various
   geographical scales.
   Erneuerbare Energiegemeinschaften (Renewable energy communities, REC)
   werden als eine M \& ouml;glichkeit gesehen, das ambitionierte europ \&
   auml;ische Ziel der Klimaneutralit \& auml;t im Jahr 2050 zu erreichen.
   Insbesondere mit der Umsetzung der RED II-Direktive ist ein starker
   Schwerpunkt auf geographische N \& auml;he gelegt worden, ein Kriterium,
   das in einigen Staaten sehr strenge Anwendung gefunden hat. Wir
   argumentieren dagegen, dass dieser Ansatz nicht hinreichend die
   positiven Effekte solcher Projekten in Betracht zieht, die stark auf B
   \& uuml;rgerbesitz und einer Bottom-up-Logik basieren, und stattdessen
   auf einem gr \& ouml;ss eren Ma ss stab operiert. Auf der Grundlage von
   5402 Fragen und 31 teilstandardisierten Interviews diskutieren wir die
   Bedeutung zweier wichtiger, auf Interessen- statt auf Ortsgemeinschaften
   gegr \& uuml;ndeter Energiegemeinschaften in der Europ \& auml;ischen
   Union: die Genossenschaften Ecopower in Flandern und \& egrave; nostra
   in Italien. Wir zeigen, dass diese Organisationen eine wesentliche Rolle
   in der Energiewende spielen, indem sie ihre Mitglieder durch eine
   gemeinsame Identit \& auml;t zusammenbringen, neue Normen und
   Handlungsweisen schaffen und vor der Logik des Marktes sch \& uuml;tzen.
   Dieser Befund wird noch verst \& auml;rkt, wenn die Genossenschaften wie
   im Fall von Ecopower einen gewissen Grad der Unternehmensreife erlangen
   und damit \& uuml;ber mehr Ressourcen verf \& uuml;gen, um Teilnehmer
   und Territorien einzubeziehen und zu st \& auml;rken. Wir ziehen den
   Schluss, dass es sich bei Energiegemeinschaft um einen
   ,,Grenzbegriff{''} handelt, der nicht auf ortsbasierte Initiativen
   beschr \& auml;nkt werden sollte.},

Abstract = {I compare Christopher Lasch's thought to specific features that research
   in political science attributes to contemporary populism. Lasch openly
   favoured a historical form of populism but is rarely considered when
   current forms of populism are discussed. The research literature
   characterizes populism as superficially tied to democracy while
   undermining it, as committed to the moral binary of people and elites,
   and as intellectually ``thin{''} because it does not engage with the
   complex theories that ground other ideologies. These characters make
   populism incoherent and inimical to democracy. Lasch manifests all three
   characters while connecting them to a sustained worldview. Humans'
   awareness of death is the core feature that makes them rational, ethical
   and equal. Attempts to dilute that awareness are inimical to the
   equality at democracy's basis. Experts and professionals encourage this
   dilution by promising remedies and progress. Democracy depends on
   ordinary people who resist elites and their complex phraseologies.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the current literature on the relationship
   between populist rule and liberal democracy by conducting quantitative
   research with a time-series cross-sectional dataset covering 18 Latin
   American countries from 1991 to 2017. The findings reveal an overall
   negative correlation between populist rule and the quality of liberal
   democratic institutions, highlighting their inherent incompatibility.
   Nevertheless, this paper argues that several factors influence the
   governing populists' ability to erode liberal democracy. Specifically,
   it is observed that the negative impact of populist rule on the quality
   of liberal democratic institutions is amplified in the presence of
   higher levels of natural resource rents and lower levels of industrial
   employment and financial development. Moreover, it is found that the
   impact of these moderating variables on the relationship between
   populist rule and liberal democracy is contingent upon the ideological
   orientation of governing populists.},

Abstract = {Political parties are considered the basic institutions in a
   representative democratic system. It engaged the party members through
   internal and external party activities. The members of established
   political parties have gained more power to select candidates and party
   leadership in developed democracies. Pakistan is a developing democratic
   country; Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf announced an intra-party election in
   2012 to elect candidates for the general election 2013 in Pakistan.
   However, it is a fact that intra-party participation promotes equality
   and increased vote bank, party membership and turnout in general
   elections. The main aim of this paper is to examine the consequences of
   the intra-party election of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf held in 2012.
   Hence, this study concludes that the membership and vote bank of
   Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf has increased, grass-roots members promoted
   through proper channels and many candidates elected first time as
   members of parliament, as well as impacted the turnout in general
   elections of Pakistan. This study is an attempt to examine the impact of
   intra-party elections on the party membership, vote bank and turnout in
   general elections held in Pakistan before and after this intra-party
   election.},

Abstract = {There has been scant empirical evidence linking associational membership
   to general trust and trustworthiness. This study explores urban youth
   clubs in Mali and asks: is membership in these groups associated with
   greater trust and trustworthiness toward society? It leverages 18 months
   of fieldwork, including 375 group surveys, 2,525 individual surveys,
   over 1,300 trust games, and transcripts from 66 focus groups. We use
   propensity score matching to analyze how members and nonmembers play the
   trust game with strangers. Members are more trustworthy; they return
   12\% more to their partners than nonmember peers. We do not find a
   systematic effect of membership on trust. Trustworthiness in the game is
   also positively correlated with self-reported trust and tolerance as
   well as real-world behaviors including volunteering and helping friends.
   Focus group data highlight five mechanisms by which membership fosters
   general trustworthiness: bonding among diverse members, bridging, public
   goods provision, socialization, and psychological support.},

Abstract = {Fetishism is one of the fundamental concepts of Marx's critique of
   political economy. The goal of this paper is to explore the relationship
   between the concept of fetishism and the concept of ideology, i.e. to
   consider the ways in which the concept of fetishism can be related to
   theories of ideology developed by Marx himself and Marxist theorists.
   Conception of fetishism in Marx's critique of political economy is
   presented in the first part of the paper, while the second part explores
   various Marxist interpretations of ideology, with an emphasis on the
   distinction between critique of ideology and theory of ideology. The
   third part of the paper focuses on the conception of modernity developed
   by contemporary Marxist theorist Jacques Bidet. His theory, which
   heavily relies on Marx's insights, provides an original solution to the
   problem of the relationship between ideology and fetishism.},

Title = {Institutions and Partisan Politics Make the Difference: a Comparison of
   Municipal Waste Prevention Policies in Independent Cities in North
   Rhine-Westphalia},

Abstract = {Extracting, processing, and utilizing scarce natural resources are
   associated with negative environmental impacts. Reducing these impacts
   requires a consistent circular economy and the prevention of waste
   production. Whereas waste prevention has long been a legal priority, in
   practice the focus has mainly been on the separate collection and
   recycling of waste, and only recently has more interest in waste
   prevention been observed. Relevant to the implementation of a consistent
   waste prevention policy are, above all, the municipalities, which are
   responsible for the disposal of household waste and at the same time
   have leeway with regard to waste prevention. However, waste prevention
   policies between cities differ in terms of the level of ambition. With
   the help of fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis and theories of
   comparative policy research, this paper examines how the variance found
   in 22 independent cities in North Rhine-Westphalia can be explained. Our
   results show that for a nonambitious waste prevention policy, a
   privatized performance of tasks and a combination of a low share of
   seats for the Green Party and high capacities in waste incineration
   plants are sufficient. However, the share of Greens in the council as
   well as capacities in waste incineration plants and the organizational
   structure of municipal waste management as institutional factors also
   play roles in explaining ambitious waste prevention policies. This paper
   contributes to the debates on the role of partisan politics in
   environmental policy and at the municipal level as well as on the
   effects of privatization. Against the background of a great need for
   modernization of waste incineration plants, our results are also
   relevant for the current debate on the future of our circular economy.},

Abstract = {Success is an important aspect of evaluating activism because the latter
   is a vehicle for political change. However, the idea of `success' has
   proved difficult to capture in easily measurable ways. This has led some
   analysts to overlook its complexities and others to avoid the idea
   altogether, instead focusing on impacts, consequences and other
   seemingly less loaded terms. The definition of activism success
   therefore remains unsettled and under-studied. This article argues that
   an important perspective in evaluating activism is that of the activists
   themselves. What constitutes success (or not) for them must be an
   important consideration in defining and analysing it because it
   underpins the sense of purpose and value they put on what they do and
   helps to sustain them in the longer term. A workshop conducted with
   grass-roots activists in Liverpool provides useful insights towards
   this. The analysis of their reflections on successful activism suggests
   that it is still an important idea, but a complex and nuanced one that
   is multi-dimensional, political and contested. It reflects attitudes to
   a wider range of outcomes, the value of participation and attitudes to
   power, factors that analysts should consider incorporating into future
   studies.},

Abstract = {Political science has seen a welcome increase in guidance on conducting
   field research, which recognizes the need for adaptability. But while
   disciplinary conversations on ``iterating{''} in the field have
   advanced, strategies for adapting to the breakdown of one's case
   selection-an all-too-frequent problem faced by field researchers-remain
   underspecified. I synthesize the sources of case selection collapse and
   puts forward four strategies to help scholars iterate when things fall
   apart: 1) rethinking what constitutes a ``case{''} when fieldwork upends
   one's understanding of the population to which the original case(s)
   belong; 2) reorienting the object of analysis from outcomes to processes
   when new insights question the values of the outcome variable within
   one's original case(s); 3) returning to dominant theoretical models as a
   source of comparison when unanticipated changes cut off data or field
   site access; and 4) dropping case(s) that become extraneous amid
   fieldwork-induced changes in the project's comparative logic. By
   embracing these moments of seeming crisis, we can more productively
   train field researchers to make the most of the inductive discoveries
   and new theoretical insights that often emerge when one's original plans
   fall apart.},

Abstract = {Ruling elites commonly concede institutional reforms such as expanding
   the franchise. In existing models, sharing power in this manner enables
   ruling elites to credibly commit to perpetual redistribution. In `Power
   Sharing with Weak Institutions,' Powell (2024) explains why the
   commitment problem runs deeper: When institutions are weak, elites are
   likely to block the implementation of promised institutional
   concessions. I provide new insights into three foundational premises of
   Powell (2024) and related models. First, I identify a necessary
   condition for a common result: Ruling elites always minimize permanent
   power-sharing concessions vis-a-vis temporary concessions, subject to
   preventing revolt. However, unless reforming institutions is somehow
   costly, these two tools are perfect substitutes. Second, I discuss how
   to conceptualize institutional strength within this class of models.
   Third, in weak institutional environments, I suggest how scholars can
   model credible commitments to share power or democratize.},

Abstract = {The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), spearheaded by China, is reshaping
   the global economy, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa
   (MENA). This article focuses on Iran and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
   (KSA), scrutinizing how the BRI has catalyzed economic changes in these
   countries. Using qualitative and quantitative data, it analyzes their
   unique responses to the BRI, considering their economic challenges and
   political goals. Employing the theory of complex interdependence, it
   examines how both countries leverage the BRI to diversify their
   economies and enhance cooperation, altering their global positions. This
   analysis highlights the BRI's profound impact on Middle Eastern
   geopolitics beyond its economic implications. This study offers a more
   analytical understanding of its significance by providing insights into
   the BRI's role in global economic dynamics.},

Abstract = {We identify four patterns of diffusion that are likely to explain how
   trends in death penalty usage spread among countries. The first is
   geographic proximity, which creates dependency relations between nations
   that in turn affect the spread of changes in death penalty regimes. The
   second is global diffusion, meaning processes that spread ideas
   globally. The third is cultural homogeneity, which can be expected to be
   conducive for diffusion; studies show that countries similar in terms of
   language and religion influence each other to a great extent. Finally,
   similar colonial heritage, which can establish cultural and
   institutional ties between countries. This study encompasses all
   independent countries of the world over the period 1800 to 2021. In
   addition to measures of diffusion, a number of control variables are
   introduced. Relationships are measured using statistical techniques
   complemented by qualitative analyses.},

Abstract = {Mainstream parties have taken increasingly restrictive immigration
   policy positions across Western Europe. Yet the political consequences
   of this behaviour for citizens' democratic norms and practices are still
   not well understood. This article focuses on public political trust.
   Bridging the literatures on immigration-related trust and spatial
   theory, the spotlight is put on the consequences of mainstream party
   position-taking on immigration for the interconnectedness of citizens'
   immigration policy preferences, political distrust and far-right voting.
   An analysis of data from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey and European
   Social Survey across 14 Western European democracies (2006-2018)
   suggests that tougher immigration positions of centre-right parties in
   government weaken the link between immigration scepticism and political
   distrust and, in turn, the relevance of political distrust as a
   precursor of far-right voting. This has important implications for our
   understanding of immigration politics and advances the existing
   literatures on party competition, political trust and far-right voting
   in several ways.},

Abstract = {Studies have repeatedly documented the cost of ruling: governing parties
   generally suffer electoral defeats. We approach this empirical law of
   political science from the perspective of another empirical law: the
   incumbency bonus, the fact that incumbents get more media attention than
   the opposition. Our claim is that the bonus constitutes an electoral
   liability because it reflects the critical approach of media to
   government power. News featuring incumbents is therefore associated with
   a more negative tone than news featuring the opposition. This incumbency
   burden in turn affects government support negatively. Empirically, we
   draw on an extensive news corpus covering four European countries over
   two decades, combined with monthly poll data. Analyses show that the
   incumbency burden in political news is an empirical reality, and that
   variations in the burden contribute substantially to predictions of
   government support. Finally, the negative burden effect is stronger for
   single-party cabinets, but stable throughout government tenure.},

Abstract = {What do modern election campaigns look like? According to the most
   recent accounts, they are data-driven operations in which extensive data
   are collected and targeted messages are deployed in efforts to maximize
   support. Whilst highlighting important new developments, in this article
   we argue that a focus on novel practices offers a distorted picture of
   modern campaigns. Presenting a unique analysis of over 22,720 separate
   items of expenditure made by political parties at the 2019 UK general
   election, we demonstrate that whilst there is some evidence of a
   `fourth' era of campaigning, these novel practices do not define
   campaigns. Taking a more holistic approach that examines how campaign
   activities are blended and entwined, we offer unprecedented insight into
   the nature of modern campaigns, revealing variation in parties' campaign
   strategies. We also introduce a new dataset for those interested in
   party campaigns and call for others to pursue a more holistic analysis.},

Abstract = {UK in a Changing Europe (UKICE) is a comparative newcomer among think
   tanks and it has produced a wide-ranging report on the state of the UK
   economy. It asks whether the UK economy is caught in a `doom loop' where
   performance is bad, but policy options are constrained by the fiscal
   position. Unlike some SWOT analyses it looks as strengths as well as
   weaknesses, but these may favour the more prosperous parts of the UK.
   The ideas presented could help prevent the UK falling into the doom
   loop, but politicians tend to favour solutions which have a short-term
   payback. We need long-term thinking.},

Abstract = {2023 has been a year marking a turning point, with two women in leading
   positions for the first time in Italian politics. Elly Schlein was
   elected leader of the Democratic Party in February 2023, while a few
   months earlier Giorgia Meloni, leader of the radical right Brothers of
   Italy, became prime minister. When Schlein and Meloni celebrated their
   victory with the identical phrase `They {[}the men] didn't see us
   coming', both leaders showed great awareness that their rise shook the
   traditionally Italian male dominated political environment. Will the
   election of the two leaders result in a more structural change? The
   article seeks to address this issue, focusing on three key aspects: the
   historical roots of the women's exclusion from Italian politics; the
   distinctive political careers of Meloni and Schlein; and the success of
   the radical right Meloni government in defending the traditional family,
   while Schlein is facing difficulties to revive the party and to build a
   single opposition.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {A growing literature posits that vote buying dynamics depend on
   characteristics of the context and its voters. We explore vote buying in
   Nepal using a multi-methods approach combining survey experiments,
   semistructured interviews, and focus group discussions. We find that
   vote buying in Nepal aligns somewhat with other contexts. A list
   experiment reveals approximately 25\% of Nepali voters receive a
   voter-buying offer and, in an unmonitored but contingent exchange, the
   same percentage vote for the offeror candidate or party. Cash and other
   private goods are the most common offers. In contrast to findings from
   other contexts, however, voter education level is the strongest
   predictor of refraining from vote buying in Nepal, and wealth is not a
   significant predictor. Our list experiment also finds that, in Nepal,
   clientelism appears to be a socially undesirable activity. Overall, our
   results support the increasingly dominant viewpoint that vote buying is
   highly context dependent.},

Abstract = {When do electoral incentives encourage candidates to target immigrants
   with discriminatory rhetoric? address this question through a novel
   dataset of refugee -related tweets by elites in Lebanon, the country
   hosting the most Syrian refugees per capita globally. I find that
   Lebanon's 2018 election, the first under new set of electoral rules,
   precipitated an increase in anti -migrant tweets. However, the electoral
   campaign not affect candidates' rhetoric uniformly, but rather fueled
   xenophobic discourses specifically among Christian candidates, whose
   voter base is particularly hostile towards refugees, and especially
   among Christians facing the fiercest electoral competition. This paper
   makes three contributions: theoretically, it elucidates consequences of
   partisan competition for xenophobia; conceptually, it relaxes an
   assumption common in ethnic institutions literature that ethnic
   composition is fixed over time; and empirically, it demonstrates social
   media data can be harnessed for expanding a nascent literature on
   migration politics in the Global South.},

Abstract = {This article examines the formation and continuity of the legal identity
   of Karabakh Armenians as a group, focusing on the challenges they faced
   after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the war between Armenia
   and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. Trapped between two newly
   independent states, Karabakh Armenians managed to establish their own
   legal identity while lacking a connection to statehood or even external
   recognition of their state-like entity. The study combines a descriptive
   qualitative approach with doctrinal legal analysis, considering the
   external and internal dimensions of collective legal identity and the
   legal system constructed by the group. Unlike other cases such as, for
   example, Taiwan and Macau, Karabakh Armenians faced hostile conditions
   and challenges to their identity from Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the
   international community. The article argues that their legal identity
   should be viewed from the perspective of access to rights rather than
   the legality of their self-constructed (illegal) entity. Although their
   external legal identity is contested, the internal legal identity
   maintains continuity and structures. However, the vulnerability of such
   constructed legal identities becomes apparent due to challenges to the
   external identity of Karabakh Armenians, risking the group's ability to
   maintain its collective legal identity in case of reintegration into
   Azerbaijan.},

Abstract = {Variation in election boycotts in Africa and the Middle East raise the
   question of the factors that influence the likelihood of boycotts.
   Examining this dynamic in Africa, the Middle East and around the globe,
   we explore one possible factor influencing national election boycotts:
   the relative level of popular support between the regime and opposition.
   Utilising the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) dataset, we find that when
   the regime has greater popular support than the opposition, the
   likelihood of major boycotts is low. In contrast, when the opposition
   has more popular support than the regime at the point of election, the
   likelihood of boycotts increases. These findings highlight the
   importance of publicly observable levels of support as a means for
   opposition parties to gauge the possible payoff for boycotting,
   particularly in authoritarian and hybrid regimes where lack of
   transparency creates uncertainty regarding other sources of regime
   strength or weakness.},

Abstract = {Political theory, and American political thought especially, has
   recently seen a surge in scholarship on James Baldwin. This article
   combines two threads in Baldwin scholarship concerning self-knowledge
   and the political importance of love and argues that only such a
   synthesis makes Baldwin's thought clear. We ought to recognize that
   Baldwin' quintessential action of love is a confrontation that is
   inextricable from the liberating power of self-examination. Love becomes
   political through the artist, who functions as a lover for society at
   large. I develop my account of Baldwin's political love by examining his
   nonfiction, and I demonstrate Baldwin's commitment to this vision with
   an analysis of his often-overlooked play Blues for Mister Charlie.
   Baldwin's connection between love, politics, and art is especially
   relevant to considerations of the ongoing crises of race in America, but
   it also speaks more broadly to questions raised by the democratic
   tension between inclusion and exclusion.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the rising number of LGBTIQ+ politicians across the
   world has been matched by an increase in academic attention on which
   factors foster or hinder their careers. Here, we provide a comprehensive
   analytical review of the relevant literature, with the goal of
   illustrating both its synergies and imbalances. We show that most of the
   existing evidence specifically concerns LGBTIQ+ politicians' electoral
   performance. Moreover, this knowledge has largely been produced in very
   similar contexts politically and socioculturally. Finally, we highlight
   the potential of investigating a number of additional factors that may
   impact LGBTIQ+ political careers, such as intersectional dynamics that
   may have a differentiated impact within this population. Future works
   could expand the scope of this literature by considering these elements
   and focussing more on the direct experience of LGBTIQ+ politicians.},

Abstract = {Indonesian Islamic thought is important in the context of contemporary
   Indonesian politics. Contemporary politics has seen a shift from
   sectarian and ideological toward more inclusive and dynamic dialogues.
   In Indonesian Islamic thought, there is a contestation in the public
   sphere between conservative and progressive currents. The conservative
   trends are usually rather closed to new interpretations, while the
   progressive tend to be open to new trends based on social realities. The
   future of open Islamic thought in Indonesia as a characteristic of
   wasatiyah Islam will be maintained as its two largest Islamic
   organizations, Muhammadiyah and the Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), continue to
   fight for the ideals of Islam. In addition, inclusive Islam will gain
   strength if political parties are no longer sectarian but extend the
   post-Islamism movement.},

   works focus on the so-called ``modern presidency.{''} This article
   examines the issue of presidential power in the 18th and 19th centuries
   using the actual words of presidents themselves. We examine how these
   presidents referred to power in their Inaugural Addresses, Special
   Messages, Veto Messages, and Annual Messages. Analyzing textual data
   from the American Presidency Project focusing on Washington through
   McKinley, we find important variations in how presidents referred to
   power in presidential communications, across administrations, document
   type, and over time. Results indicate that these presidents were quite
   active in discussing a variety of policy areas. Our results add to our
   understanding of earlier presidents, as well as to the nature of
   presidential rhetoric and policymaking.},

Abstract = {Emotions shape strategic conflict dynamics. However, the precise way in
   which strategic and emotional concerns interact to affect international
   cooperation and contention are not well understood. We propose a model
   of intergroup conflict under incomplete information in which agents are
   sensitive to psychological motivations in the form of anger. Agents
   become angry in response to worse-than-expected outcomes due to actions
   of other players. Aggression may be motivated by anger or by beliefs
   about preferences of members of the other group. Increasing one group's
   sensitivity to anger makes that group more aggressive but reduces
   learning about preferences, which makes the other group less aggressive
   in response to bad outcomes. Thus, anger has competing effects on the
   likelihood of conflict. The results have important implications for
   understanding the complex role of anger in international relations and,
   more generally, the interplay between psychological and material aims in
   both fomenting and ameliorating conflict.},

Abstract = {Why do autocratic ruling parties adopt certain candidate selection
   processes, and what effects do they have on political outcomes? This
   article argues that many contemporary autocracies democratize candidate
   selection to address the demands of multiparty elections, but that this
   creates unforeseen hazards. Autocrats centralize candidate selection to
   reassert control over the composition of legislatures, but not
   necessarily to recruit more effective representatives. These ideas are
   explored in Cameroon, a longstanding authoritarian regime that has
   altered its candidate selection twice. Using an original biographical
   dataset and elite survey that measures legislative role orientations,
   the article shows how changes to candidate selection allowed the
   Cameroonian regime to retain more partisan legislators and to recruit
   new candidates who were more oriented to the party than the
   constituency. The article expands the comparative study of candidate
   selection to new settings and provides insights into how candidate
   selection helps shape and sustain authoritarian regimes.},

Abstract = {Slovenia, a small state, was actively involved in the formation of the
   Responsibility to protect (R2P) and continuously supports the principle
   through its own normative development (such as in the 2015 Declaration
   on Foreign Policy of the Republic of Slovenia and its Foreign Affairs
   Strategies) and by regular appointment of its R2P national focal points,
   which provide relevant domestic capacity to actively promote R2P's
   operationalization domestically, regionally, and at the global level,
   most prominently within the UN. Several regional European R2P Focal
   Points Meetings and six biennial academic interdisciplinary conferences
   on R2P have been organized in Slovenia, providing opportunities to
   enhance its capacity to lead a well-informed active advocacy for R2P.
   Moreover, in July 2020 Slovenia supported the first standalone HRC
   Resolution on the Fifteenth anniversary of the R2P. In April 2022,
   Slovenia was among the 83 cosponsors of the UN General Assembly
   Resolution on Standing mandate for a General Assembly debate when a veto
   is cast in the Security Council. Now, with Slovenia's election as a
   non-permanent UN Security Council member for the period 2024-25, an
   important opportunity has arisen to use accumulated knowledge and
   experience and strive for efficient operationalization of R2P, including
   through peace operations. The aim of this paper is to discuss Slovenia's
   relationship with the R2P, including during Slovenia's candidacy for the
   non-permanent seat at the UN Security Council, and to suggest possible
   future developments.},

   measures of ideology. We evaluate these widely used measures through an
   original national survey. Descriptively, we show that Americans'
   understandings of ``liberal{''} and ``conservative{''} are weakly
   aligned with conventional definitions of these terms and that such
   understandings are heterogeneous across social groups, casting doubt on
   the construct validity and measurement equivalence of ideological
   self-placements. Experimentally, we randomly assign one of three
   measures of ideology to each respondent: (1) the standard ANES question,
   (2) a version that adds definitions of ``liberal{''} and
   ``conservative,{''} and (3) a version that keeps these definitions but
   removes ideological labels from the question. We find that the third
   measure, which helps to isolate symbolic ideology from operational
   ideology, shifts self-reported ideology in important ways: Democrats
   become more conservative, and Republicans more liberal. These findings
   offer first-cut experimental evidence on the limitations of
   self-reported ideology as a measure of operational ideology, and
   contribute to ongoing debates about the use of ideological
   self-placements in American politics.},

Abstract = {Collaboration and relations are essential for most civil society
   organizations (CSOs). Still, little is known about what drives CSOs to
   collaborate among themselves when supporting refugees. By analysing
   drivers for collaboration and relational aspects in Malmo, Sweden, as
   the empirical setting, including how past, present, and anticipated
   future relations affect CSOs' organizational behaviour, the article aims
   to contribute to our understanding of CSOs' collaboration when
   supporting refugees. While collaborative drivers are important to
   understand the motivation to collaborate, adding a relational
   perspective helps us understand the complexity of collaboration,
   especially when CSOs do not exclusively collaborate to benefit their own
   organization. Past relations are essential for some collaboration,
   whereas other collaboration and behaviour create new ties and intensify
   existing ones. Moreover, the results demonstrate that on a local level,
   a variety of CSOs is crucial as they complement each other in covering
   different needs.},

Abstract = {U.S. homesteading has been linked to establishing federal sovereignty
   over western lands threatened by the Confederacy, foreign powers, and
   the Indian Wars in the last half of the nineteenth century. However, the
   bulk of homesteading actually took place in the early twentieth century,
   long after these threats to federal ownership ceased. We argue that this
   ``late homesteading{''} was also an effort to enforce federal rights,
   but in response to a different threat-a legal one. Questionable federal
   land policies in the late nineteenth century dispossessed massive
   amounts of Indigenous lands, and exposed the federal government to
   legal, rather than violent, conflict. Late homesteading was used to make
   the dispossession permanent, even in cases where a legal defeat
   eventually occurred. Examining the qualitative evidence, and using data
   on the universe of individual homesteads and federal land cessions
   across the 16 western states, we find evidence consistent with this
   hypothesis.},

Title = {Selecting Out of ``Politics{''}: The Self-Fulfilling Role of Conflict
   Expectation},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {119},
Number = {1},
Pages = {40-55},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent decades, the term ``politics{''} has become almost synonymous
   with conflict. Results from eight studies show that individuals averse
   to conflict tend to select out of surveys and discussions explicitly
   labeled as ``political.{''} This suggests that the inferences
   researchers draw from ``political{''} surveys, as well as the
   impressions average Americans draw from explicitly ``political{''}
   discussions, will be systematically biased toward conflict. We find
   little evidence that these effects can be attenuated by emphasizing
   deliberative norms. However, conflict averse individuals are more
   willing to discuss ostensibly political topics such as the economy,
   climate change, and racial inequality, despite reluctance to discuss
   ``politics{''} explicitly. Moreover, they express greater interest in
   politics when it is defined in terms of laws and policies and debate is
   deemphasized. Overall, these findings suggest the expectation of
   conflict may have a self-fulfilling effect, as contexts deemed
   explicitly ``political{''} will be composed primarily of conflict
   seekers.},

Abstract = {Political campaigns increasingly conduct experiments to learn how to
   persuade voters. Little research has considered the implications of this
   trend for elections or democracy. To probe these implications, we
   analyze a unique archive of 146 advertising experiments conducted by US
   campaigns in 2018 and 2020 using the platform Swayable. This archive
   includes 617 advertisements produced by 51 campaigns and tested with
   over 500,000 respondents. Importantly, we analyze the complete archive,
   avoiding publication bias. We find small but meaningful variation in the
   persuasive effects of advertisements. In addition, we find that common
   theories about what makes advertising persuasive have limited and
   context-dependent power to predict persuasiveness. These findings
   indicate that experiments can compound money's influence in elections:
   it is difficult to predict ex ante which ads persuade, experiments help
   campaigns do so, but the gains from these findings principally accrue to
   campaigns well-financed enough to deploy these ads at scale.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the effectiveness of potential partisan
   gerrymandering of the US House of Representatives across a range of
   states. We use a heuristic algorithm to generate district maps that
   optimize for multiple objectives, including compactness, partisan
   benefit, and competitiveness. While partisan gerrymandering is highly
   effective for both sides, we find that the majority of states are
   moderately biased toward Republicans when optimized for either
   compactness or partisan benefit, meaning that Republican gerrymanders
   have the potential to be more effective. However, we also find that more
   densely populated and more heavily Hispanic states show less Republican
   bias or even Democratic bias. Additionally, we find that in almost all
   cases we can generate reasonably compact maps with very little sacrifice
   to partisan objectives through a mixed-objective function. This suggests
   that there is a strong potential for stealth partisan gerrymanders that
   are both compact and beneficial to one party. Nationwide, partisan
   gerrymandering is capable of swinging over 100 seats in the US House,
   even when compact districts are simultaneously sought.},

Abstract = {While the number of women standing as candidates in federal elections in
   Canada has surged, it is unclear how voters respond to the increased
   presence of women in politics. In this paper, we study who votes for
   women candidates in four recent federal elections. Using Canadian
   Election Study data and biographical information on candidates for the
   2011, 2015, 2019 and 2021 federal elections, we examine the impact of
   the presence of women candidates on voting in Canadian elections.
   Leveraging the individual-level nature of our data, we also explore
   heterogeneity in voting for women candidates, with specific attention to
   patterns of gender affinity voting, and the moderating effects of gender
   consciousness and gender attitudes on voting for women. Our findings are
   similar to previous work in failing to show much evidence of an
   electoral disadvantage for women candidates. We also find very little
   evidence of heterogeneity in this basic null effect in terms of voters'
   gender or their gender attitudes.},

Abstract = {This is a reflective piece on my trajectory and contributions in the
   field of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) in Scotland and beyond.
   I start with a highlight in my career and then reflect back in order to
   identify what helped me get there. I want to share some insights into
   EDI work that I have gathered along with others over the past 23 years
   or so. EDI is a fertile career path and even an industry these days,
   partly as a result of the consciousness-raising of contemporary
   movements like \#MeToo and Black Lives Matter. Yet, the issues raised by
   these movements internationally, have been well-known locally for
   decades and a great deal of work has been done to respond to them. What
   does this seemingly novel interest in, for example, intersectionality,
   equality, diversity, inclusion, belonging, anti-racist approaches and
   the decolonisation of the curriculum mean? I know where my interest
   stems from and, whilst sharing some reflections around these terms as
   buzzwords, I have rather focused in this piece on some lessons and on
   the processes that led me to learn them in my career in EDI.
   Necessarily, in this piece, I will share my EDI experience as a Mexican
   in Glasgow, which includes migration's mark on my well-being,
   opportunities and safety in hostile anti-migrant environments. However,
   I also want to share what has become a life mantra of mine, a means of
   survival, my permanent wish to find in everything, a positive note.},

Abstract = {The post 9/11 global proliferation of counterterrorism legislation is
   increasingly being interpreted as part of a longer story of colonialism.
   Scholars have shown how expansive counterterrorism can be interpreted
   not merely as an exceptional state of violence in situations where the
   rule of law and guarantees of ordinary civil liberties are suspended,
   but as a form of law-making that draws upon colonial logics and
   frameworks of governance. However, a major lacuna in this scholarship is
   the lack of attention to counterterrorism laws in postcolonial states
   and their negotiations with colonial logics of law-making. This article
   makes a postcolonial contribution to Critical Terrorism Studies and
   International Politics by showing how colonial logics of
   counterterrorism are repurposed by postcolonial states in comparable
   ways. By comparing counterterror laws in two postcolonial states, India
   and Egypt, this article shows how colonial logics intersect with
   nationalist ideologies, postcolonial anxieties, as well as an attempt by
   postcolonial states to seek international legitimacy post 9/11 vis-a-vis
   the War on Terror. In both states, counterterror laws are weaponised to
   target civil society activists, journalists, and religious, ethnic and
   other minorities in comparable ways. This article, therefore, challenges
   the centrality of 9/11 and state of exception/emergency in the framing
   of counterterror laws. In so doing, it advances knowledge of
   counterterrorism vis-a-vis postcolonial engagements with colonial
   epistemes and ``normal{''} practices of security.},

Abstract = {In terms of party systems, Canada's system is an outlier. In our present
   work, we develop Richard Johnston's account of Canada's polarized
   pluralism in three ways. First, we link the literature on party systems
   to social identity theory. Second, we make an empirical contribution by
   directly testing Johnston's claim that intergroup affect plays a central
   role in shaping the dynamics of the party system. Using Canadian
   Election Study data from seven elections, we offer strong empirical
   support for the theory of polarized pluralism. Congruent with existing
   research, we find that the most important feature summarizing
   group-based affect in Canadian politics corresponds with the ideological
   left/right divide, but we also find that feelings toward groups on a
   second, uncorrelated axis (feelings toward Quebec and minority groups)
   shape vote choice. Yet our results show that fault lines in the
   polarized pluralist structure of the Canadian party system are emerging.},

Abstract = {Democratic innovations scholars note that deliberation has the potential
   to counteract populism. However, so far, we do not know what the
   theoretical foundation would be to expect such an effect, nor do we know
   to what extent the supposed effect actually materialises empirically.
   This study adds to the literature by offering a theoretical framework
   and by testing this framework empirically. Specifically, we examine to
   what extent citizens with a high degree of populist attitudes became
   less populist after participating in a deliberative event. We study an
   actual citizens' assembly on climate mitigation policy in the
   Netherlands via pre- and post-surveys and carry out an SEM analysis (N =
   105). We find that citizens with a higher degree of populist attitudes
   do become less populist, but find no evidence that this is due to the
   (perceived quality of the) deliberation. At the same time, the climate
   skeptics who participated became more populist.},

Abstract = {Emerging health crises challenge and overwhelm federal political systems
   (Greer et al. 2020, Global Public Health 15: 1413-6). Within the context
   of COVID-19, states and governors took charge in the absence of a
   coordinated federal response. The result was uneven policy responses and
   variance in health-related and economic outcomes. While existing
   research has explored public evaluations of state COVID-19 policies, we
   explore primary care physicians' trust in state government for handling
   the pandemic, as well as their evaluations of their state government's
   treatment responsibility for the pandemic and their state's policy
   response. We find that general preferences for the role of the
   federal/state government in addressing the pandemic are shaped by
   individual-level physician partisanship. Specific evaluations of state
   policy responsiveness are influenced by whether physicians' partisan
   preferences matched their governor. We also find, however, that
   Republican physicians were critical of Republican governors and
   physicians were less partisan than the general public. At least within
   public health, there are limits to the influence of partisan identity on
   expert (physician) political evaluations.},

Abstract = {A large literature has shown that ballot order and ballot structure can
   influence vote choice. We focus on another behavioral cue for voting,
   the symbols that are assigned to candidates in many democracies. We take
   advantage of a naturally occurring experiment in India, where
   independent candidates can choose from a list of free symbols and
   conflicting choices are resolved by a drawing of lots. We find that
   winning the draw has a substantial positive effect on vote share. We
   also find some evidence that candidates attempt to choose their symbols
   strategically, for instance choosing household goods common in their
   constituencies.},

Title = {A Deepening/Widening Tradeoff? Evidence from the GATT and WTO},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {77},
Number = {2},
Pages = {549-561},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper proposes that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
   (GATT) and its successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO),
   experienced a deepening/widening tradeoff: as their membership increased
   (greater width), their effectiveness in promoting trade between
   members/participants declined (lesser de facto depth). This proposition
   is tested using gravity models of bilateral trade, first separating the
   GATT and WTO, which are usually combined into a single variable, and
   then adding a width variable corresponding to each institution. The
   results show that (1) both regimes were the deepest, or the most trade
   effective, when they had the fewest member-states and (2) their trade
   effectiveness declined, eventually becoming statistically insignificant,
   as more countries joined. As a quantitative case study, this paper
   provides some of the first evidence consistent with a tradeoff between
   depth and width within international institutions.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of the course of the Russian-
   Ukrainian war (2014-2022) in the geopolitics context. Russia's war
   against Ukraine is determined by geopolitics and Vladimir Putin's
   imperial policies. The emphasis on the military aspects of this
   international political phenomenon is due to the return of conventional
   war to its traditional place in the international relations system,
   which has become a key threat to international security. During the
   period under review, Russia moved from implementing hybrid warfare to
   conventional warfare concept.},

Abstract = {Can anger appeals create support for separatism? This article presents
   the results of a region-wide field experiment conducted by a third-party
   local organization during the 2017 Catalan regional elections,
   estimating the effect of anger-inducing campaign messages on actual
   electoral outcomes. The organization randomly assigned municipalities to
   three conditions: proindependence anger-inducing leaflets depicting
   state repression, proindependence emotionally neutral leaflets, or no
   leaflets. Results show that anger-inducing leaflets increased the
   prosecessionist parties' vote share by 1\%-1.7\% compared to a zero
   increase in municipalities that received emotionally neutral leaflets or
   no leaflets. I assess the mechanisms and generalizability of the field
   experimental results in two independent survey experiments. These
   findings demonstrate how anger-inducing reminders of state repression
   through electoral campaigns can shape voting behavior in the real world,
   even in highly polarized settings.},

Title = {Insiders and Outsiders: Feminists in the Academy Influencing
   Gender-Sensitive Parliamentary Change},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {While the idea of a gender-sensitive parliament is over 20 years old
   (Childs \& Palmieri, 2023), institutional reforms in the name of gender
   equality have been slow to materialise around the world. Where change
   has occurred, it appears to have been catalysed by a limited range
   of-sometimes confluent-factors including the public airing of
   allegations of sexual misconduct in the \#MeToo era, the increasing
   salience of gender-sensitive parliament international norms, and the
   role of feminists in the academy. Celis and Childs (2020) identify
   feminist academic critical actors as those who rather than simply
   researching parliamentary change, explicitly undertake institutional
   (re)design and (re)building work (see also Childs, 2024). In this
   article, we uncover the work undertaken by feminists in an Australian
   academic institution to support the 2021 independent inquiry of the
   Australian Human Rights Commission into Commonwealth parliamentary
   workplaces. This work-undertaken by the authors as both insiders and
   outsiders-informed the analysis and recommendations in the Australian
   Human Rights Commission's report, and since its launch, has also kept
   pressure on the various bodies entrusted with implementing
   gender-sensitive changes. We argue that feminists in the academy are
   uniquely positioned to navigate insider and outsider roles in support of
   gender-sensitive parliamentary reform.},

Abstract = {The article argues that Russia's regime changed considerably under the
   rule of Vladimir Putin. It evolved from authoritarian and autocratic to
   a personal dictatorship with totalitarian elements. While Putin and his
   entourage initially tried to build an authoritarian system that relied
   more on mass-media than on violence they changed course after the crisis
   of 2011 and increasingly relied on repression and outright violence. The
   possibility of returning to a dictatorial rule may also be explained by
   pointing to pillars of the Soviet system that survived the collapse of
   communism unreformed, i.e. the secret police and the armed forces. The
   return of both Russia and China to personal dictatorships constitutes a
   challenge to the liberal order of 1989.},

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-90},
Abstract = {How do government budgets affect autocrats' incentives to share or
   consolidate power? We estimate a dynamic decision problem in which
   autocrats build their ruling coalitions to maintain power and maximize
   rents amid fluctuating budgets. Even for unconstrained autocrats, we
   find that ousting (potential) rivals is costly and, when budgets are
   tight, reduces their short-term survival prospects. Despite these
   upfront costs, exclusion has dynamic benefits during periods of
   prolonged budget contraction: autocrats reduce patronage obligations
   that they may struggle to afford on a tighter budget, which increases
   their long-term survival chances and share of spoils. By contrast,
   budget upswings have lasting positive effects on power sharing. Our
   counterfactuals indicate that budget shocks comparable to those
   generated by recent commodity booms increase the probability of
   inclusive ruling coalitions by over 10 percentage points over 25 years.
   Case studies of Sudan and Liberia indicate that our model and results
   describe the tradeoffs and survival strategies of real-world autocrats.},

   multiple issues concerning the procedures of monetization of reparations

Abstract = {Great powers play an important role in global and regional processes. In
   the context a shift towards deglobalization among Western countries,
   China and Russia are maintaining their positions on economic
   globalization and implementing their ideas to advance Eurasian
   integration. The objective of this study is to analyze and compare the
   Chinese and Russian perspectives on globalization and regionalization,
   and to examine the implications for Eurasian integration. Based on a
   comparison of the official positions and expert views of the two
   countries, the author came to the conclusion that despite some
   differences in Chinese and Russian views, they share common positions on
   two important matters of globalization and regionalization:
   globalization should be beneficial to all humanity, and regional
   integration does not contradict globalization. This provides the basis
   for cooperation between the two countries in the Eurasian integration
   processes- the SCO, the EAEU and the BRI.},

Title = {Saying no. The intersectional forces behind chambermaids' strikes},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2024},
Number = {148},
Pages = {45-68},
Abstract = {Strikes led by chambermaids often aroused more surprise, even sympathy,
   than other forms of mobilization. This astonishment, which reveals the
   strength of the denial of anteriority surrounding the struggles of
   working-class women, is amplified by the supposedly ``improbable{''} and
   rare nature of female struggles. In order to break with this narrative,
   which associates the working-class population with ``ressource less{''}
   groups, this article aims to deconstruct the study of involvement in
   trade union mobilisations by adopting a general and intersectional
   sociology. From which spaces do these mobilizations emerge? How do they
   unfold in practice? To give an accurate account, it is necessary to
   observe in practice the intersection of multiple forms of
   dominations-class, race and gender-in order to identify how they
   organise a collective identification based on an understanding of these
   mechanisms of oppression (1), but also how mobilisation can represent an
   opportunity to escape from these dominations (2). The quest for autonomy
   and the defense of the right to live with dignity have their origins
   well upstream of the conflicts observed. In this respect, they form part
   of a continuum between the private and professional spheres. The article
   draws on an ethnographic survey made up of observations and interviews
   with chambermaids mobilized in Marseille between 2017 and 2022.},

Title = {The Non-contributory Monetary Transfers of the Fourth Transformation's
   Government in Mexico (2018-2024)},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Abstract = {The article studies the foundations, the implementation, the impact and
   the relevance of non-contributory monetary transfers (NCMT) during the
   presidency of Andr \& eacute;s Manuel L \& oacute;pez Obrador, who
   headed what he called the ``Government of the Fourth Transformation of
   Public Life of Mexico{''} (4T) in the 2018-2024 six-year period. The
   study was based, first, on a discursive analysis of the central texts of
   the 4T Government to examine causal connections between diagnoses,
   proposals and objectives, and, secondly, on a study of official
   in-formation sources to investigate the mechanisms, amounts,
   distribution schemes and results of the NCMT, framing the analysis with
   a historical and systemic approach to social policy in Mexico. The main
   results indicate that the NCMT during the presidency of L \& oacute;pez
   Obrador favored the increase in household income, even helping to
   improve poverty levels, but their distribution mechanisms affected the
   progressivity of social spending in Mexico. It is concluded that, if the
   country wants to build a universal, redistributive, supportive and
   comprehensive social protection system, then the social policy based on
   TMNC must address three latent risks: the disparity in the care of
   people's life cycles, the familiarization of social policy and fiscal
   unsustainability},

Abstract = {The European Court of Justice (ECJ) isn't a political actor,
   nonetheless, can play a role in solving political debates. ECJ makes
   rulings on political issues decided by EU bodies. Although ECJ has never
   elaborated a comprehensive political question doctrine, it did decide
   case-by-case whether a political problem is justiciable from the 1970's
   up to now. ECJ legally reviews the operation of the Executive on EU and
   national level. Besides, courts usually refrain from cases of directly
   political substance because they cannot take over the role of political
   actors. The aim of the research is to examine how ECJ has tried to
   balance between these requirements, and in which cases did it shape
   European intergovernmental relations. The analysis is mainly based on
   court cases and their political context. Main conclusion of the research
   is that ECJ can make a valuable contribution to Europe on becoming a
   real political community.},

Title = {Gus Dur's Enduring Legacy: Accruing Religious Merit in the Afterlife},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Abdurrahman Wahid (Gus Dur), Indonesia's fourth president (1999-2001)
   and leader of the traditionalist Islamic organisation Nahdlatul Ulama
   (1984-1999), continues to influence Indonesia in positive and meaningful
   ways despite his death in 2009. He proved that Islam and a pluralistic
   political culture were compatible and that Indonesian Islam had a global
   role. His legacy continues through the Wahid Foundation, Nahdlatul
   Ulama, and the National Awakening Party. The Wahid Foundation operates
   under the directorship of his daughter, Yenny Wahid, and is dedicated to
   improving Islam and Indonesian society through documenting religious
   intolerance and injustice and by issuing recommendations. Following
   Nahdlatul Ulama's National Congress in December 2021, its leadership has
   been dominated by Gus Dur's allies, including his wife and four
   daughters, and his former presidential spokesperson Yahya Cholil Staquf,
   all of whom have a deep commitment to his values. Gus Dur's former
   political party, the National Awakening Party, remains another
   institution which supports pluralism and secular inclusiveness. However,
   the relationship between Gus Dur's allies and this party remains
   fractured, just as it was before he died. Despite an impeached
   presidency, a fallout with the National Awakening Party, and the
   considerable time that has passed since his death, he has produced an
   enduring legacy. Public deference to the late Gus Dur is reminiscent of
   the nine saints who Islamised Java half a millennia ago. This is because
   traditionalist Muslims believe that one's deeds which produce on-going
   benefits to society will, in the afterlife, continue to accrue religious
   merit, and millions visit Gus Dur's grave every year to demonstrate
   this.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the challenges of democratic sustainability of
   Georgian political parties in modern Georgia. It tries to reveal the
   main reasons why, according to some researchers, there is a crisis of
   intra-party democracy in the modern Georgian party system, why the
   state's drive towards democratic development has not been reflected in
   the organizational structure of parties. The article examines the
   challenges of leader hierarchy, ideological fragmentation, and
   organizational fragmentation in modern Georgian political parties using
   the conceptual framework of the theory of resource dependence and
   in-depth qualitative research methods.},

Abstract = {The mobilization of the Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity (
   MpjD ) in Mexico is acknowledged as a key moment in the country's
   contemporary history. We analyze how the MpjD has been studied and what
   we know about this social movement. Based on a review of articles
   published in the most prestigious journals in Mexico, we argue, first,
   that most studies about the MpjD are characterized by a non-systematic
   treatment of information that leads to conclusions that are rather
   hypotheses that need to be tested; second, that the academic production
   on this social movement has provided reflections and analyses around six
   themes relevant to social movement studies.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},

Pages = {181+},
Abstract = {Chechens were involved in the fight against the Tsarist Empire's
   expansion into the Caucasus in the 19th century. However, the centre of
   resistance was in Dagestan, and the Circassians fought longer than they
   did. Even under Soviet rule, when Stalin had entire ethnic groups
   deported, the suffering of the Chechens did not exceed that of the other
   peoples who also suffered this trauma. The special case refers to the
   massive experience of violence and extermination that the Chechens
   experienced in two wars against Russian troops after the dissolution of
   the Soviet Union, to the character of the political order that emerged
   after the ceasefire between Moscow and Groznyi, and to Chechnya's
   position in the federation. Chechnya under Ramzan Kadyrov has become a
   ``private state{''} that, although committed to Russia, claims a degree
   of autonomy and dynastic rule that is at odds with Putin's ``power
   vertical{''}.},

Title = {Protecting Future Generations Through Minilateralism: Climate Clubs and
   Normative Legitimacy},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Despite three decades of global climate negotiations and high
   expectations for the 2015 Paris Agreement, global emissions continue to
   grow. To protect future generations from severe harm, scholars,
   environmentalists, and politicians alike explore potential supplements
   to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change process.
   One potential supplement is climate clubs of a type where a small number
   of ``enthusiastic{''} countries embark on ambitious mitigation efforts
   while encouraging other, more ``reluctant{''} countries to join.
   Previous research has shown that this club type possesses a significant
   potential for expanding membership and eventually becoming highly
   effective in reducing global emissions. A common criticism of climate
   clubs, however, is that they lack legitimacy. Assessing this criticism,
   we argue that climate clubs of the type considered here can be
   normatively legitimate. The main challenge for normative legitimacy
   concerns climate clubs' use of incentives, particularly negative
   incentives, to attract members. However, we argue that even negative
   incentives for participation can be legitimate, assuming they meet a set
   of relevant legitimacy criteria-including that the club respects human
   rights, provides a comparative benefit, maintains institutional
   integrity, implements only proportional incentives, and fulfills a
   requisite set of epistemic criteria. We also argue that the normative
   legitimacy of climate clubs' use of incentives for compliance is less
   challenging than the normative legitimacy of their use of incentives for
   participation.},

Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-63},
Abstract = {This article argues that German Antifa is historically grounded in
   radical counterpublics, established and maintained via discursive
   infrastructures by which activists declare, debate, justify and limit
   their direct actions. This process of discursive communication not only
   allows them to legitimize their direct action (up -to and including
   violence) as morally justified Militanz, but also delineates these
   actions as political rather than criminal. Beginning with the case study
   of the criminal trial against the so-called Antifa East, the paper
   argues that factions of German Antifa have abandoned these
   infrastructures, but in doing so have also lost the moral justification
   for their actions. By abandoning their -own movement limits and
   traditions, the Militanz wielded instead evokes only a ghost of that
   justification. Instead, these clandestine assaults - enacted without any
   discursive explanation or counterpublic engagement - cannot be
   understood as political, leaving those involved charged under the German
   legal code ( 129) regarding criminal rather than political and
   potentially terrorist ( 129a) engagement.},

Abstract = {This article examines the junction of state healthcare and punishment
   through HIV criminalization. By problematizing the application of
   criminal law to HIV in Finland, the study locates a genealogy of the
   ``infectious criminal{''} - a figure at the cusp of these two forms of
   state power. The article traces how this figure, evoked in official
   debates from the early 20th century onwards, justified punitive measures
   to control marginalized people, from poor merchants to prisoners -of
   -war, sex workers, vagrants, and later, migrants. Drawing on
   parliamentary archives, the article asks how punishment and existing
   social injustices are narrated, maintained, and connected. Revealing a
   continuum of punishment and healthcare, HIV criminalization - especially
   within a nation deemed exceptionally non -punitive and welfare -oriented
   - is a crucial point from which to examine the connections of social
   injustice and criminal justice.},

   SOCIAL MOVEMENTS STUDIES},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Pages = {135-150},
Abstract = {The current article examines the notion of transformism within the
   framework of Gramscian theories. This term was initially used to
   describe parliamentary politics in Italy and meant the cooptation of
   radical parties into the government under the leadership of moderate
   parties and the subsequent moderation of radical parties. Antonio
   Gramsci rethinks transformism and defines it as the strengthening of the
   ruling class through the absorption of active elements from other
   classes. Although this can be found in works of some scholars utilizing
   different Gramscian approaches, it still requires some concretization.
   The article examines the development of this notion in Gramsci's texts
   as well as its usage in the Gramscian political economy and Ernesto
   Laclau's theory. The article demonstrates that the notion of
   transformism can be applied to social movements studies. Under
   conditions of transformism separate achievements of social movements
   turn into strategic failures. The functioning of transformism is based
   mainly on trade-offs between upper and lower classes. Upper classes
   satisfy some demands from below and lower classes constrain their
   discontent to cooperate with upper classes. Transformism amounts to the
   absence of independence of social movements, their readiness for
   trade-offs, cooperation with the authorities and parliamentary
   mechanisms as well as organizational weakness.},

Abstract = {What would a peaceful resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war look like? To
   begin to answer that this article views the origins of the conflict
   through a geographical lens rather than the reductive historical framing
   that has dominated political punditry in the US and UK. Located in
   comparative literature on nationalism which suggests that territorial
   disputes are the norm rather than the exception in post-Soviet
   borderlands, it explores how the Ukraine conflict demonstrates a series
   of political geographical issues at the local, regional, and national
   scales. Following Millar in adopting a trans-scalar conception of the
   inter-relation of peace and conflict, it draws on comparative examples
   to suggest creative ways in which these issues might be addressed in
   future peace negotiations.},

Abstract = {China follows the logic of profit, Russia the logic of rent. The logic
   of profit demands competitiveness. This is achieved through innovation,
   a willingness to take risks, and investments that increase productivity.
   Apart from the defence and nuclear sectors, Russia's industry is not
   competitive on the world market. The country resembles a raw material
   export economy, as the dependency theory diagnosed for Third World
   countries in the 1970s. Russia's war against Ukraine acts as an
   accelerant for the development of a new global constellation. At the
   centre of this constellation is the hegemonic conflict between the old
   power, the United States, and the new power, China. They are the leading
   powers of a liberal and an authoritarian camp. In this respect, the
   Ukraine war, like the Korean War, is a proxy war between East and West,
   except that China and Russia have swapped roles. Russia has found itself
   in indirect opposition to the United States, because the latter is
   Ukraine's biggest supporter. At the same time, Russia has become
   completely dependent on China.},

Title = {Financing the Energy Transition in Latin America: the Role of
   Multilateral Development Banks},
Journal = {DESAFIOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The need to transform the energy matrix in the face of climate change
   demands the financing of strong investments in infrastructure,
   transportation, and productive capacity. Multilateral development banks
   (MDBs) are influential political and economic stakeholders that finance
   and mobilize green resources, but the literature has not extensively
   studied their financing in Latin America. This paper aims to identify
   and systematize some of the main trends regarding the role of
   multilateral banks in financing the energy transition in this region.
   Based on recent secondary sources, we analyze the relationship between
   climate financing and energy transition, reconstructing the trends of
   the main MDBs in Latin America, as well as their commitments and
   recommendations for financing that sector. We find that multilateral
   climate financing is insufficient to address regional needs in terms of
   energy transition. The historical record of assistance and standing
   commitments predict a growing role for MDBs, not exclusively in
   financing. It is less clear whether their conditionalities and
   recommendations, together with their role as financing catalysts, will
   overcome the tensions observed in their previous historical
   interventions in developing countries.},

Abstract = {The corruption scandals of recent years in Peru have highlighted the
   existence of a politico-administrative system based on circulations
   between ``public{''} and ``private{''} spaces. This article invites us
   to look at these revolving doors beyond the single issue of conflict of
   interest, to consider what they reveal about the struggles and power
   relations that seek to preserve, or on the contrary to change, the
   legitimate characteristics of those who hold state power. More
   specifically, it seeks to link the study of these circulations back to
   the social and political environment in which they took place. The
   article also stresses the need to take account of the broader
   sociological dimensions underlying these movements, pointing out that
   strategies for professionalisation (and movement) are not the same
   depending on the social origin of civil servants.},

Abstract = {The election of the histrionic economist Javier Milei, self-identified
   as anarcho-capitalist, a complete outsider with ultraliberal economic
   ideas, conservative social ideas, and with authoritarianism overtones in
   relation with democratic institutions, it is a novelty for the
   Argentinean political system. Amid an economic crisis with inflation
   above 200\%, the majority chose this outsider whose victory seemed
   impossible just one year before. The com-bination of economic voting and
   antisystem protest vote, with the promise of change and the failed
   electoral strategies of the traditional parties were key to produce this
   result. The incapacity of both traditional parties to resolve the long
   economic crisis during their terms in office generated a rejection of
   the status quo and an opportunity to renovate the political supply,
   which was leveraged by Milei. This article describes the emergence of
   Milei and the 2023 electoral results at all levels. It then moves to
   discuss the conditions that explain his victory and the perspectives for
   governability created by the combination of these electoral results and
   the new political system characterized by political fragmentation.},

   Closure of Borders by COVID-19: A Reading from Everyday Objects},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICAS-REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS SOBRE ESPACIO Y PODER},

Pages = {357-378},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the situation of border mobility in the
   Peruvian-Chilean territory in the context of border closures due to
   COVID-19. Despite the official closing, popular understanding was that
   the border never was fully closed and that trucks, capital, commodities,
   grocery products, among other things, continued to make it across the
   border. Hence, to analyze the production of border mobility in the
   context of COVID-19, we suggest a more complex approach to the concept
   of mobility itself, as well as the adoption of alternative empirical
   approaches. In this piece the mobility turn and object tracking
   approaches are adopted. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with
   eighty-six formal and informal economic actors on the Tacna border, from
   which we selected border economic actors from the health and food
   sectors. Among the main findings, the analytical possibilities of the
   mobility turn to study border mobility are corroborated, as well as the
   presence of the border-device as an element that engages in the
   production of mobilities beyond being considered only as a device that
   crosses between an origin and a destination.},

Abstract = {In October 2016, the Colombian electorate narrowly rejected in a
   plebiscite the final agreement to end the conflict with the
   longest-running armed insurgency in the Western Hemisphere, the FARC.
   The plebiscite's result provides a unique opportunity to assess dynamics
   in civil conflict termination preferences. I exploit the unexpected
   victory of the No vote, observed during the AmericasBarometer fieldwork,
   to estimate the effect of the uncertainty about the trajectory of the
   conflict generated by the outcome of the plebiscite. The unexpected
   defeat of the peace plebiscite did not measurably change the expressed
   support for the recently rejected agreement. However, it increased the
   public support for a negotiated rather than military settlement to the
   conflict, as well as respondents' willingness to give concessions to
   FARC members. These findings inform the broader literature on civilian
   preferences toward civil conflict termination and compromise.},

Abstract = {Russia has activated its Central Asia policy since the attack on
   Ukraine. Ideologically, this is part of its ``turn to the East{''}. The
   states in the area, which Moscow sees as its sphere of interest, are to
   be integrated into an anti-Western coalition. In the five countries,
   concern about Moscow's imperial expansion has grown. At the same time,
   however, they are benefiting from the increased interest. Kazakhstan and
   Uzbekistan can simultaneously deepen their relations with Russia and
   expand those to the West. Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan remain heavily
   dependent on Moscow. Turkmenistan is not giving up its isolationist
   course.},

   political struggle of the popular classes in Latin America in what is

   thoughts of Antonio Gramsci, particularly in the concepts of hegemony,
   intellectuals, and transformism, which inform our analysis of the
   situation and guide our understanding of reality. The analysis of the
   first hundred days of the Lula government supports subsequent
   reflections on the (mis)paths of education in Brazil.},

   into the radical flank effect (RFE) on movementcountermovement dynamics.
   Through an analysis of media coverage, primary sources, and interviews
   with past participants, the study shows how Anti -Racist Action (ARA)
   functioned as a radical flank within the antiracist movement,
   contributing to the collapse of the Heritage Front, in part by
   reorganizing relationships among less militant anti -racists. It reveals
   how, under certain conditions, radical organizations can remake the

Abstract = {The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is not only an unprecedented
   cross-continental infrastructure investment program, it is also a key
   pillar of China's foreign policy. The Chinese government seeks to tie
   BRI member states closer to its political system and to enhance its soft
   power across the globe. Whether this has been successful has been
   analyzed for individual countries but, as of yet, there is a paucity of
   cross-national evidence on the geopolitical impact of the BRI. We
   collected a novel global dataset on bilateral cooperation agreements
   with China in the context of the BRI for all states across the globe. We
   rely on voting similarities in the United Nations General Assembly
   (UNGA) to analyze whether the decision to join the BRI is linked to
   geopolitical alignment with China. We apply generalized synthetic
   control models and community detection algorithms to estimate the impact
   of BRI membership on voting similarity to China. Our findings show that
   the signature of BRI membership agreements had no discernible short-term
   impact on voting similarity to China in most regions of the world. The
   exception is Europe, where BRI membership induced a backlash against
   China. Our findings suggest that European states counter-balance to the
   US and signal their independence from China after signing a BRI
   agreement.},

Number = {1},
Pages = {95-114},
Abstract = {The U.S. Administration has been increasingly using secondary sanctions
   to make legal persons in foreign jurisdictions comply with the U.S.
   regimes of economic restrictive measures. The practice of secondary
   sanctions has been towering since the outbreak of Russia's special
   military operation in Ukraine. Hundreds of companies in third
   jurisdictions found themselves in Specially Designated Nationals List of
   the U.S. Department of the Treasury. At the same time the concept of
   secondary sanctions as well as empirical reflections of their use hardly
   enjoy satisfactory reflection in the academic literature. The purpose of
   the article is to fill in this gap. Key research questions concern the
   intensity of the use of the U.S. secondary sanction in relation to
   Russia, the main reasons of their use against particular persons, the
   distribution of sanctioned persons in terms of country of origin and
   other variables. Main hypothesis implies the quantitative rise of
   sanctions related to the violation of export control and connections to
   already sanctions persons in such countries as China, UAE, Turkey and
   others. The processing of 511 cases of secondary sanctions database is
   the main tool to test this assumption.},

Title = {Food in the international institutional discourse: A lexical analysis of
   official documents on climate change},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {the WHO or the EU- have revealed an increasing concern about climate
   change and its effects, both on the planet and on human health. In light
   of these developments, the identification of the causes and strategies
   to mitigate the effects of climate change has become a central issue on
   the international political agenda.This work aims to analyse the role
   that food plays in the international official documents considered as
   the ``road maps{''} for addressing climate change. To this end, a
   lexical and semantic analysis of four key documents has been conducted:
   ``Climate Change: Synthesis Report{''} (IPCC, 2014), ``2030 Agenda for
   Sustainable Development{''} (UN, 2015), ``The Paris Agreement{''} (UN,
   2015) and the ``European Green Deal{''} (European Commission, 2019).The
   results show that food is addressed in these documents, albeit with not
   a significant weight. The limited references found are related to
   agri-food production but not linked to consumption or diet, despite the
   pivotal role of food in driving changes in the agri-food system and,
   therefore, in achieving sustainable development},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {656-674},

Abstract = {Despite technological innovation and the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a
   dearth of experimental research on the effects of virtual instruction.
   Using an original field experiment conducted among 100 UAE and USA
   students, we investigate how a Collaborative Online International
   Learning (COIL) project on international development shapes social
   trust, tolerance, and political engagement. In an experimental design,
   UAE-based students were randomly assigned to a group with either their
   classmates or, through online interaction, with USA-based students,
   while in a quasi-experimental design, USA-based students collaborated
   online with UAE-based students. UAE-based COIL students developed
   greater interpersonal trust of others in their society, but a reduced
   desire to make friends with Americans. USA-based students developed a
   greater desire to follow international issues (i.e., political
   engagement). Proposing a social identity theory (SIT) of social capital
   formation, we argue that UAE-based students, who live in a society in
   which social identity is highly salient, redefined their social in-group
   boundaries and came to see members of their own diverse society more
   warmly while perceiving greater differences from Americans. By
   illustrating COIL's complex effects, our research extends the literature
   on social capital formation and offers insights for enhancing the
   benefits of COIL.},

   anti-BLM attitudes},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {93},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {For at least 75 years, social scientists have pointed to racial
   attitudes as a dominant force in American politics. But the relative
   positioning of outgroups can be dynamic, suggesting that attitudes
   toward one group might be predictive of vote choice in one electoral
   context, but not another. Here, we estimate which group attitudes in the
   U.S. were correlated with presidential vote choice from 2012-2020. Panel
   data at four time points during this period indicates that attitudes
   towards Muslims were the strongest predictor of Republican presidential
   support until 2019, but faded in substantive importance in 2020 when
   anti-BLM attitudes became highly prognostic. High-frequency weekly data
   from 2019-2020 pinpoints when this shift occurred: anti-Muslim prejudice
   shaped Trump approval from 2019 through May 2020. After the George Floyd
   murder, pro-police and anti-BLM attitudes immediately become the most
   important predictors of Trump approval, whilst the effect of anti-Muslim
   attitudes diminished.},

Title = {Making sense of comeback prime ministers},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 23},
Abstract = {Comeback prime ministers (CBPMs), who return to office after a break,
   have been a notable, but conspicuously understudied, feature of several
   parliamentary democracies. This article provides the first ever
   comparative study of CBPMs. To make sense of the varying frequency of
   CBPMs in 18 established democracies from 1945 to 2024, we refer to
   competing party rationales of (re-)selecting prime ministers in
   different contexts, with the latter shaping the former. Apart from
   powerful presidents in semi-presidential regimes, the frequency of early
   replacements of prime ministers, the scope of alternations of the prime
   minister's party, and the degree of intraparty personalization offer
   plausible explanations for the cross-national and temporal variation of
   prime-ministerial returns. While CBPMs have become less common since
   1990, the remaining cases include some particularly powerful party
   leaders, underscoring the continuing importance of this neglected
   feature for understanding chief executive selection in established
   parliamentary democracies and beyond.},

Abstract = {Youth wings fulfil vital democratic functions. They connect parties with
   young people, socialise them into political life, and train future
   candidates and officials. Yet, youth wings have been largely overlooked
   by party scholars. In this article, we present the Youth Wing Membership
   Survey (YOUMEM) dataset. With responses from over 5000 members of 12
   centre-left and centre-right youth wings in Australia, Austria, Germany,
   Italy, Spain, and Sweden, YOUMEM is the largest comparative study of
   youth wing members ever conducted. Using the dataset, we examine some
   basic questions about youth wing members: who they are, when and why
   they join. We find that youth wing members are primarily men and highly
   educated. Many have relatives who were party members, and most are
   extremely ambitious compared to senior party members. Beyond these
   commonalities, we also uncover differences across party families and
   countries. Our project provides a unique window on the young people in
   contemporary youth wings.},

Abstract = {This study examines the conditions under which insurgent groups can be
   successfully integrated into the state at political and military levels
   during post-conflict stabilization. While previous research emphasizes
   disarmament, demobilization, and integration, these steps are neither
   universal nor linear. Our research proposes an alternative approach:
   integrating insurgent groups into military and political institutions
   without requiring disarmament. This strategy hinges on a two-pronged
   method that divides insurgent groups into leaders and soldiers. Leaders
   are integrated into the political system, ensuring their power,
   legitimacy, and regional influence, while soldiers retain their arms
   within the military, reducing the risk of splinter groups and
   resentment. This approach provides insurgents with a compelling
   incentive to join state structures, discouraging a return to violent
   non-state activities. Through a mixed-methods analysis, including
   t-tests and case studies from the Philippines and El Salvador, we
   demonstrate that maintaining armed insurgents within state institutions
   reduces violence and fosters stability. This study builds on previous
   research by exploring tactics to draw insurgent groups into negotiations
   and offers significant contributions to state-building literature.},

Title = {Explicit partisan candidate support and bureaucratic responsiveness in
   hyper-partisan environment: Evidence from a field experiment},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {93},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Previous studies have analyzed public officials' responsiveness toward
   citizens based on citizens' racial and ethnic, gender, or religious
   identities. However, much less attention has been paid to whether a
   citizen's explicit partisan identification influences election
   officials' responsiveness. Therefore, this study investigates whether
   election officials discriminate against partisan identifying
   constituents when responding to election-related email inquiries using a
   nation level audit experiment. In doing so, email inquiries about voting
   information with varying experimental conditions are sent to election
   officials across the United States (n = 6606). I find a lower likelihood
   of response for email inquiries with explicit partisan identifying
   conditions compared to those without any explicit partisan
   identification. The results provide implications on how recent increase
   in burdens associated with election official duties, aided by
   extraordinarily high levels of affective polarization and negative
   partisanship in the United States, can undermine some American voters'
   general ability to freely and fairly participate in elections.},

Abstract = {Extensive research explores women's entry into parliament and their
   political influence. However, reasons for women leaving, particularly in
   the European Parliament context, remain unclear. This study investigates
   departure patterns of women European parliamentarians from 2009 to 2019,
   investigating the role of politicians themselves, national parties, and
   voters. The study finds less gender differences in parliamentarians'
   exit than expected, highlighting national parties' pivotal role in a
   women-friendly European setting and the importance of the mediating
   power of the electoral system. Contrary to expectations, national
   parties do not disadvantage women during re-selection. Women experience
   higher re-election probabilities, influenced by parties' strategies and
   voter preferences. Also, those women who want to progress to the
   national political level from the EP are not less likely to succeed in
   their post-parliamentary career. I conclude that electoral institutions,
   along with their interaction with political actors, influence women's
   career paths.},

Abstract = {The divergent transition trajectories on which some countries in the
   MENA region embarked after the 2011 uprisings sparked extensive
   scholarly attention. While the state remained largely intact in Egypt or
   Tunisia, the violent revolt in Libya led to civil conflicts and the
   collapse of governmental institutions. However, there is limited
   research examining the consequences of such collapse in the
   post-conflict scenario. This article aims to fill this void in the
   literature and analyses what shaped the transition path in Libya after
   regime change focusing on the security factors. It uses qualitative
   content analysis of official documents and media reports, and 26
   semi-structured interviews conducted in 2023 with key Libyan respondents
   including a former deputy prime minister, former ministers, current and
   former MPs, a former secretary general of a political party, a former
   director of a Libyan TV channel, radio broadcasters, NGOs leaders, human
   rights activists, and others. The data analysis is done with the help of
   process tracing. The main results indicate that several domestic and
   international security factors such as, the type of military response to
   the uprising, non-state armed groups, and external intervention shaped
   the country's transition.},

Abstract = {Value conflict is at the heart of opposition to multiculturalism in
   Europe. Yet previous studies have not established which type of value
   conflict generates more anti-immigrant bias. We present a simple,
   cost-effective, and easily scalable experimental design to test how
   anti-immigrant bias responds to perceptions of value conflict generated
   by violations of welfare state norms and gender equity norms. Both types
   of norms are central to public debates about immigration in Europe. We
   collect new data from three European countries on natives' beliefs
   regarding immigrants as likely violators of these norms, and we measure
   the salience of these norms in native society. We find that natives do
   not always sanction immigrants more for norm violations and their
   reactions to norm adherence or violations are consistent with a logic of
   ``updating{''} for high-salience norms in countries where norm adherence
   is itself a norm.},

Abstract = {From the bottom to the top of society, many white men are angry. This
   article provides a reputation-based rationale for this anger.
   Individuals care about their social status (elite vs. non-elite) and
   their social reputation (how they expect others to perceive them).
   Everyone is uncertain about how one becomes a member of the elite. When
   new information reveals that the system is biased in favor of white men,
   the social reputation of all white men decreases, causing a payoff loss.
   In contrast, policies meant to reduce inequalities in the access to the
   elite can be supported by some white men and opposed by others. The
   article highlights how the backlash from white men in recent years needs
   not be driven by racial animus or sexism and may instead be caused by a
   loss of status and/or reputation.},

Abstract = {The Elections Act 2022 requires voters to present photo identification
   at general elections in Great Britain and local elections in England. In
   this article, we use data from the British Election Study Internet Panel
   to identify who does and does not own the necessary photo documents and
   how this affected turnout in the 2023 and 2024 local elections, as well
   as the 2024 General Election. We find that around 5\% of the voting-age
   population lack valid voter identification and that this is related to
   age, education, socio-economic status, and social grade. The data also
   give us a reliable indication of the party-political impact of the photo
   ID requirement. We find that conservative voters are more likely to hold
   valid photo identification than supporters of other parties. We also
   find that a small but significant proportion of registered voters
   (between 1.2\% and 2.4\%) reported either being turned away or dissuaded
   from voting at these elections because of the requirement.},

Abstract = {Existing research on digital activism in autocratic regimes tends to
   treat Central Asia as a homogenous entity with similar approaches to how
   new digital technologies are used for the purposes of state repression.
   Drawing on Feldstein's taxonomy of digital repression and new empirical
   evidence, this essay shows that digital state repression varies across
   the region. The presented findings add to current scholarship in three
   ways. First, we consider different forms of autocracies within Central
   Asia as a differentiated geography. Second, we examine the factors which
   led to a shift in how technologies could be used by autocracies as
   policy instruments to control their citizens. Third, given the growth of
   technological innovations that can sustain autocracies, we examine the
   specific mix of technologies within the different types of autocracies
   that shape the strategies of repression in Central Asia. The research
   presents a variegated picture of digitally-enabled deepening
   autocratization in Central Asia.
   Die bisherige Forschung zum digitalen Aktivismus in autokratischen
   Regimen tendiert dazu, Zentralasien als homogene Einheit mit \&
   auml;hnlichen Ans \& auml;tzen hinsichtlich der Nutzung neuer digitaler
   Technologien f \& uuml;r staatliche Repression zu behandeln. Basierend
   auf Feldsteins Taxonomie der digitalen Repression und neuen empirischen
   Erkenntnissen zeigt dieser Aufsatz, dass sich digitale staatliche
   Repression in den L \& auml;ndern der Region unterscheidet. Die
   Ergebnisse erg \& auml;nzen die aktuelle Forschung in dreierlei
   Hinsicht. Erstens betrachten wir verschiedene Formen von Autokratien in
   Zentralasien als differenzierte Geografie. Zweitens untersuchen wir die
   Faktoren, die zu einer Verschiebung darin, wie Technologien von
   Autokratien als politische Instrumente zur Kontrolle ihrer B \&
   uuml;rger eingesetzt werden konnten, gef \& uuml;hrt haben. Angesichts
   der Zunahme technologischer Innovationen, die Autokratien
   aufrechterhalten k \& ouml;nnen, untersuchen wir drittens den
   spezifischen Technologiemix innerhalb der verschiedenen Arten von
   Autokratien, der die Repressionsstrategien in Zentralasien pr \&
   auml;gt. Die Forschung pr \& auml;sentiert ein vielf \& auml;ltiges Bild
   der digital erm \& ouml;glichten, sich vertiefenden Autokratisierung in
   Zentralasien.

   eacute;rique \& eacute;tatique varie \& agrave; travers la r \&
   eacute;gion. Les r \& eacute;sultats enrichissent les recherches
   actuelles de trois mani \& egrave;res. Premi \& egrave;rement, nous

   technologies pourraient \& ecirc;tre utilis \& eacute;es par les
   autocraties comme instruments politiques pour contr \& ocirc;ler leurs
   citoyens. Troisi \& egrave;mement, compte tenu de la croissance des
   innovations technologiques qui peuvent soutenir les autocraties, nous
   examinons la combinaison sp \& eacute;cifique de technologies au sein
   des diff \& eacute;rents types d'autocraties qui fa \& ccedil;onnent les

   Finora la ricerca sull'attivismo digitale nei regimi autocratici aveva
   la tendenza a trattare l'Asia centrale come un'entit \& agrave; omogenea
   con approcci simili al modo in cui le nuove tecnologie digitali vengono
   utilizzate per scopi di repressione statale. Basandosi sulla tassonomia
   di Feldstein della repressione digitale e su nuove prove empiriche,
   questo studio mostra che la repressione statale digitale \& egrave;
   assai variegata in questa regione del mondo. I risultati offrono tre
   tipi di contributi agli studi esistenti. In primo luogo, consideriamo
   diverse forme di autocrazie all'interno dell'Asia centrale come una
   geografia differenziata. In secondo luogo, esaminiamo i fattori che
   hanno portato a un cambiamento nel modo in cui le tecnologie potrebbero
   essere utilizzate dalle autocrazie come strumenti politici per
   controllare i propri cittadini. In terzo luogo, data la crescita delle
   innovazioni tecnologiche in grado di sostenere le autocrazie, esaminiamo
   lo specifico mix di tecnologie all'interno dei diversi tipi di
   autocrazie che modellano le strategie di repressione in Asia centrale.
   La ricerca presenta un quadro variegato dell'autocratizzazione sempre pi
   \& ugrave; profonda, e sostenuta dalla digitalizzazione, in Asia
   centrale.},

Abstract = {Building on the body of literature that calls for a human-rights-based
   approach to the tragic phenomenon of the loss of identities of migrants
   who go missing on their journeys, this article aims to provide a legal
   conceptualization of the `right to identification' that may serve as the
   backbone of a normative framework defining state obligations regarding
   the missing in this context. It takes as a prompt the statement that
   `human beings have the right not to lose their identities after death'
   in the preamble to Interpol Resolution No. AGN/65/RES/13 concerning
   disaster victim identification, and examines the rights to dignity and
   identity, including how they operate and interact with each other and
   with the right to truth. Recognizing that both the missing themselves
   and their loved ones may be regarded as victims of involuntary
   disappearance, a central argument here is that dignity is the right of
   the dead as well as the living, that dignity serves to protect identity
   as an integral aspect of personhood, and that the right to
   identification is exercisable by next of kin via the right to truth. The
   article's final section outlines the state obligations incorporating
   identification, as derived from human rights and humanitarian law. The
   author hopes that this inquiry into the right to identification can spur
   further action on the part of states to fulfil their humanitarian
   duties.},

Abstract = {Democracy is backsliding in Europe and around the world as citizens'
   trust in elected representatives and institutions wanes. Representation
   theories and studies have mostly centred on the representatives, rather
   than the represented. But how do citizens perceive political
   representation? Are their perceptions of any consequence at all? In this
   paper, we set forth a framework of representation in the eyes of
   citizens, based on Pitkin's classic concept of representation in
   conjunction with Weissberg's distinction between dyadic and collective
   representations. We use Israel as a proof of concept for our theoretical
   framework, employing an original set of survey items. We find that, in
   keeping with Pitkin's framework, citizens perceive representation as
   multidimensional and depreciate the descriptive and symbolic-the
   standing-for-dimensions. Furthermore, citizens' democratic attitudes are
   shaped by collective representation by the parliament rather than by
   dyadic representation by an elected representative. We conclude with a
   call for a greater focus on representation from the citizens'
   standpoint.},

Abstract = {A large-scale study of US local policymaking has long been hindered by a
   lack of centralized data sources. Our own project, LocalView,
   supplements data collection efforts by creating the largest existing
   database of local government meeting transcripts, audio, and video yet
   released. In this article, we describe promises, implications, and best
   practices for using nontabular sources of meeting data in the study of
   federalism. Throughout, we argue that these new sources of data allow
   scholars to ask new kinds of research questions. We demonstrate this
   potential with an empirical application focused on the use of national
   partisan language in local government meetings. We find that nationally
   salient partisan phrases are common in local policymaking discussions
   (especially in large cities), although prominent national terms vary
   drastically in how often they are used at the local level. Finally, the
   slant of partisan language (i.e., the amount of partisan language that
   is identifiably Democratic or Republican) across local governments is
   correlated with local partisan preferences.},

Abstract = {Drawing on documentary and oral evidence presented in Module 2 of the UK
   Covid-19 Inquiry, this article asks what the inquiry tells us about the
   nature and dynamics of intergovernmental relations (IGR) from the UK and
   devolved governments' interactions over the course of the pandemic. In
   so doing, the article focusses on formal IGR structures (since
   reformed), the actions of political leaders within these formal and
   informal structures and entrenched institutional cultures, with a
   particular focus on the ways in which decision-making processes and
   devolved dynamics were understood by the principal actors over the
   course of the pandemic. The article concludes with reflections on how
   IGR might be reset or reformed by the newly elected UK government.},

Abstract = {Congress is more polarized than ever. At the same time, there are fewer
   military veterans serving in Congress than ever before. Candidates with
   military experience, along with their supporters, argue that electing
   more veterans could help reduce dysfunction and gridlock. They claim
   that military values, such as duty and teamwork, translate into
   differences in legislative behavior. But are veteran lawmakers more
   effective than those without military experience? Are they more
   bipartisan? Using House data from the 104th to 116th Congresses
   (1995-2021), I examine the extent to which military experience
   influences a lawmaker's ability to legislate and engage in bipartisan
   behavior. I find that veteran lawmakers are more effective at advancing
   consequential legislation. Additionally, veterans appear more willing to
   collaborate with members of the opposite party, especially in recent
   Congresses. These effects are particularly evident among those who
   served on active duty. I conclude by considering the implications of
   these findings for maintaining healthy civil-military relations in
   America.},

Abstract = {A number of important studies have documented gender gaps in the
   effectiveness or performance of individual representatives. Yet whether
   these differences are observable when it comes to responsiveness to
   public opinion is unclear. In this article, I examine the degree to
   which representatives use social media to dynamically respond to shifts
   in issue salience among the electorate. After combining nearly 400
   bi-weekly repeated public opinion surveys from YouGov asking voters
   about their issue priorities, I trained a large language model to
   classify the universe of elected U.S. and UK representatives' social
   media messages on Twitter to the same issues. Findings reveal that women
   representatives demonstrate greater responsiveness than their male
   counterparts to shifts in issue salience according to both women and men
   constituents. Despite an overall bias toward male constituents, female
   representatives play a crucial role in narrowing the gender gap by
   consistently aligning their attention with the issues prioritized by
   female constituents. These fi ndings not only contribute to our
   understanding of elite-voter responsiveness but also underscore the
   substantive benefits that women representatives provide for all
   constituents.},

Abstract = {This article draws on Max Weber's account of legitimate authority to
   argue that there are three key mechanisms that drive the personalization
   of power in political regimes: the mobilization of charisma, the
   mobilization of legality or formal authority, and the mobilization of
   informal authority. The mobilization of charisma involves leaders using
   emotional connections with followers to undermine formal institutional
   constraints. The mobilization of legality refers to using legal
   discourses and procedures to expand formal executive powers. The
   mobilization of informal authority relies on leaders occupying strategic
   positions in patronage networks to undermine or expand formal authority.
   Each mechanism allows leaders to escape elite accountability through
   different means. The article illustrates these mechanisms through
   historical and contemporary examples. It argues that understanding these
   distinct mechanisms can help explain variation in trajectories and
   consequences of personalization across regimes. The framework advances
   theories of personalization by highlighting how personal power relies
   not just on disrupting elite coordination but on deploying different
   forms of authority.},

Abstract = {Scientific expertise is crucial for responding effectively to
   environmental crises. Nevertheless, under conditions of political
   inequality, expert policy making can inhibit policy solutions by
   altering incentives of powerful interest groups. This is the situation
   facing the predominantly Alaska Native communities of the YukonKuskokwim
   Delta, which have long relied on salmon for subsistence and are now
   experiencing a collapse of the salmon population. Scientific evidence
   indicates that climate change is a primary cause, and experts therefore
   have opposed demands by Native subsistence fishers for ameliorative
   measures-especially restricting pollock fishing-as likely to be
   ineffective. However, this approach eliminates incentives for the
   influential pollock industry to support policies to address the salmon
   crisis, including climate-change mitigation. This article presents a
   simple formal model that demonstrates these incentive effects. This
   argument contributes to theories of business power and shows how expert
   policy making can inadvertently force marginalized communities to bear
   the burden of climate change.},

Title = {Empowered Minipublics for Democratic Renewal? Evidence from Three
   Conjoint Experiments in the United States, Ireland, and Finland},

Abstract = {T his article investigates the potential of deliberative minipublics to
   provide a new set of institutions for democratic renewal. Using three
   preregistered and identical conjoint experiments in the United States,
   Ireland, and Finland, it first shows that minipublics are moderately
   attractive institutional innovations, but that in all three country
   contexts, citizens in general are very reluctant to grant them
   empowerment and autonomy as well as ask for additional provisions (such
   as large size or large majorities for recommendations). Subgroup
   analyses, however, reveal that especially participation in minipublics
   as well as trust in other citizens as decision-makers in combination
   with low political trust produces more support for empowered and
   autonomous minipublics. But what stands out in the empirical analysis is
   that most citizens want minipublics as additions to the representative
   system, not as a replacement of the existing democratic infrastructure,
   as some minipublic advocates have suggested.},

Abstract = {While extant research has identified several determinants of the
   Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s unprecedented victory in the 2019 general
   election, they have overlooked the party's populist radical right (PRR)
   nature, particularly under the leadership of Narendra Modi. Based on the
   demand side of PRR voting, this article examines the effect of Indian
   voters' populist attitudes on their voting choices for the BJP during
   the 2019 election. Using binary logistic regression (BLR) and conducting
   a robustness check, this article identifies that the variable of
   individuals' populist attitudes does indeed exert a significant effect
   on their vote choices for the BJP during the 2019 election. In addition
   to this main variable, a number of controls that were included in the
   analysis were also found to be significantly correlated with the
   dependent variable. In light of the findings, the article proposes some
   theoretical implications.},

Abstract = {Existing literature on climate politics predominantly concentrates on
   democracies. However, there is a pressing need to examine how
   authoritarian regimes respond to climate change, given their growing
   impact on global carbon emissions and their populations' acute climate
   vulnerability. Extant research often assumes that authoritarian regimes
   have inherent advantages in addressing climate change, leading to overly
   optimistic perspectives on their capabilities. This study highlights the
   necessity of qualifying those assumptions and evaluates the comparative
   advantages and disadvantages of autocracies relative to democracies
   throughout the policy process: policy formulation (or outputs),
   implementation, and outcomes. I argue that whereas climate-conscious
   autocracies may efficiently produce policy outputs based on scientific
   evidence, they often face more challenges related to information about
   local enforcement during implementation. This may result in greater
   hurdles than democracies, even with adequate state capacity and
   monitoring infrastructure. Furthermore, this analysis contends that a
   country's developmental stage, rather than its regime type, is related
   more directly to the effectiveness of translating implementation efforts
   into tangible policy outcomes. Therefore, this article posits that the
   political science discourse, which often juxtaposes democracies with
   autocracies, should expand its scope to better understand how a
   country's developmental level influences the success of its climate
   strategies.},

Abstract = {PurposeChina's digital rise and data localization policies, grounded in
   the principle of ``data sovereignty,{''} are reshaping international
   digital borders. These policies contrast sharply with the United States'
   market friendly data governance model and the European Union's General
   Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) framework, which prioritizes the
   protection of individual rights. This study advances the discourse on
   digital re-bordering by examining the intersection of digital
   sovereignty, security, and borders in the context of China's digital
   rise and intensifying data competition between the US and
   China.MethodsThrough comparative analysis, this study reveals an
   increasing divergence in global digital governance structures and the
   emergence of competing digital borders.ResultsThese findings underscore
   the need for a new theoretical framework that reconciles differing views
   on data sovereignty and security, ultimately proposing a cohesive
   approach to address the fragmented landscape of transnational data
   governance.ConclusionThis study highlights the urgent need for a global
   data governance framework to address the current fragmented landscape of
   data regulations and the misuse or overuse of data localization.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the link between non-liberal attitudes and
   adverse exposure to market disturbances during the 2008 global financial
   crisis, drawing from the premise that anti-liberal sentiments among
   Western voters stem from economic distress. We delve into three facets
   of liberal ideology in a Swedish sample: economic liberalism, liberal
   multiculturalism and liberal internationalism. Using variation in crisis
   exposure within identical twin pairs, comprehensive longitudinal
   economic data and detailed survey responses, we find no significant
   shift in economic or multicultural liberal attitudes with different
   crisis exposures. However, exposure to increased unemployment risk
   significantly lowered support for liberal internationalism, increasing
   scepticism towards global governance and multilateral cooperation.},

Abstract = {Government responsiveness is a key feature and justification for
   democracy. Yet, previous studies show that the ability of governments to
   deliver responsive policies critically depends on the availability of
   resources. This study suggests that the shadow economy hurts democratic
   responsiveness because it reduces government revenues and decreases the
   reliability of economic statistics. Governments facing lower resources
   then respond to wider economic constraints and not to their publics.
   Using Eurobarometer data to evaluate public opinion in 15 European
   democracies and data on welfare generosity to measure policy outputs,
   this study finds that larger submerged economies correspond to less
   responsive governments. Additionally, the empirical analysis highlights
   that the shadow economy makes welfare systems less generous and taxation
   rates more demanding. These novel results have important implications
   for our understanding of democracy and help us clarify the conditions
   under which governments are more or less likely to deliver responsive
   policies. Finally, these results demonstrate the importance of studying
   the political consequences of the shadow economy.},

Abstract = {This paper is a response to Emily McTernan's book, Taking Offence. I
   focus on how to evaluate taking offence comparatively against
   alternative attitudes such as anger or blame. Drawing on some of my work
   on blame, emotion and expressive action, I sketch a way in which we
   might reach a more convincing answer than that provided by McTernan.},

Abstract = {This paper delves into Regional Organizations' reactions to crises,
   exploring whether such occurrences lead to disintegration. Crisis
   situations pose immediate and unforeseen challenges to regional
   cooperation and integration. The responses to these crises vary, with
   potential outcomes ranging from increased cooperation to disintegration
   or maintenance of the status quo. To understand why organizations
   disintegrate or hold together after crises, we compare the 2009 Eurozone
   budgetary crisis with the 1999-2001 financial crisis in Mercosur. Using
   Most Different Systems Design, we analyze factors preventing member
   defection. Our findings suggest that regional powers play a crucial role
   in preserving bloc integrity, acting as a sufficient condition to
   prevent defection. This study contributes to theory consolidation by
   testing models across different regions and moments, offering insights
   into causal mechanisms of regional disintegration or cohesion.},

Abstract = {This study analyses the implications of the adoption of online format in
   the design of democratic innovations, specifically in three key
   dimensions: the inclusiveness of participants, the provision of
   information and the interaction between participants. The main objective
   is to explore these qualities of face-to-face and online participatory
   initiatives in Spain and to try to explain their differences. Part of
   these differences may be due to the format (face-to-face versus online),
   but we will also analyse other possible explanatory factors of the
   design, such as the vocation for stability, the ideology of the local
   governments and the income of the municipalities. To do so, we follow a
   quantitative methodological design based on the analysis of data from an
   online survey addressed to all town councils of municipalities with more
   than 1000 inhabitants in Andalusia and Madrid. The database collected
   608 participatory experiences that were being implemented in 2020 at the
   local level. The main findings suggest that online initiatives show a
   greater intention of inclusiveness of participants, with more open
   selection mechanisms, as well as providing information about the process
   in a more diversified way, through various channels. In contrast, the
   online format tends to be less conducive to horizontal interaction and
   debate among participants than face-to-face initiatives.},

Abstract = {When migrants and displaced people make claims about their rights to be
   political and become acting political subjects, they challenge
   conventional notions of political and political communities. Drawing on
   ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Prague with Ukrainian citizens
   displaced by the 2022 Russian invasion, this article brings into
   conversation critical citizenship studies and literature on solidarity
   with refugees to explore the political acts of displaced Ukrainians and
   the solidarity practices of local activists. By doing so, the article
   focuses on the intricate transformations that (re)shape politics in
   terms of new subjectivities and social relations. When displaced people
   from Ukraine disrupted presumptions about their political invisibility
   and formed synergetic solidarity relations with local activists, their
   actions made new ways of relating and caring possible. This further
   transformed their political subjectivities from claimants of rights to
   Czech society (and its institutions) to claimants of rights within Czech
   society.},

Abstract = {This article suggests that since people who believe in magic and those
   who believe in conspiracy theories produce meaning and make sense of the
   world by engaging in the same process of signification, they should be
   more likely to have one such belief if they hold the other. To test this
   proposition, we perform both macro- and micro-level analyses using,
   respectively, cross-national datasets and an original set of Tanzanian
   data. Our findings from both sets of analyses reveal a strong
   association between witchcraft beliefs and the belief in conspiracy
   theories.Related ArticlesGainous, Jason, and Bill Radunovich. 2008.

   mismo proceso de significaci \& oacute;n, deber \& iacute;an ser m \&

   Para probar esta propuesta, realizamos an \& aacute;lisis a nivel macro

   un conjunto original de datos de Tanzania. Nuestros hallazgos de ambos
   conjuntos de an \& aacute;lisis revelan una fuerte asociaci \& oacute;n

Abstract = {This article interrogates the role of urban peripheries in creating
   political imaginaries and understandings of citizenship among children
   and grandchildren of insurgent citizens in urban Northeast Brazil. The
   analysis draws on data collected through 10 ethnographically informed
   focus groups with youth between 18 and 35. The article argues that,
   contrary to beliefs that young people are apathetic about politics or
   enthusiastic to engage in progressive social movements, youth have an
   ambivalent relationship with the state, informed by everyday encounters
   with precarious infrastructure, awareness of previous forms of
   collective action that determines their civic engagement, and feelings
   of belonging to home communities. The article suggests revisiting the
   concept of insurgent citizenship considering new socio-political changes
   that framed the lives of young people living in urban peripheries in the
   past two decades in Brazil and proposes ambivalence as a productive
   theoretical angle to make sense of ruptures and discontinuities in
   political practices.},

Journal = {LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the determinants of contact between
   citizens and Members of Parliament (MPs) in Africa by combining theories
   of contact developed in advanced Western democracies with theories of
   clientelism developed in the Global South. Based on Afrobarometer data
   matched with constituency-level electoral data, we provide a first
   analysis of the determinants of citizen-MP contact in 32 African
   countries, encompassing a broad range of regime types. We find that
   smaller districts and single-member districts strengthen contact across
   regime types, while electoral competitiveness is only positively
   associated with contact in more democratic settings. In line with
   clientelist theories of public resource access, district links to
   national ruling coalitions are positively associated with contact, but
   we find little evidence of partisan bias. Overall, we find that contact
   theories travel remarkably well across regions and regime types, and we
   caution against interpreting clientelistic contacts as harmful for
   democracy.},

Abstract = {This article challenges the prima facie differences between the Scottish
   independence and pro-Brexit movements, drawing similarities based on
   shared promotion of nationalism, incorporation of populism, and policy
   radicalism challenging consensuses over austerity/immigration. The
   analysis tests four hypotheses: first, their respective supporters hold
   nationalist beliefs; second, their supporters adhere to different but
   relatively radical policy preferences (tested on three dimensions:
   economic, cultural, immigration); third, their supporters adhere with
   populism; and fourth, their supporters are cynical towards perceived
   experts. The article finds the expected nationalist support, as well as
   supporters of independence/Brexit holding more radical policy beliefs
   compared to anti-independence/anti-Brexit voters. Furthermore, the
   analysis reveals a clearer picture of anti-expert and anti-elite
   populism support for Brexit, with little evidence showing these being
   features of Scottish independence support. This leaves the conclusion of
   some voter-level similarities between supporters of both movements, but
   also differences in the levels of populism among their respective
   voters.},

Abstract = {Previous research on political scandals has largely focused on the
   effects of different types of scandals or the means by which they spread
   and affect the world. Less work has examined how changes in specific,
   but common, elements of scandals can produce different results. This
   study is the first to evaluate how a spouse's decision to either leave
   or stay with a male candidate embroiled in an infidelity scandal affects
   citizen evaluations of the candidate and spouse. We leverage an online
   survey experiment to test this. The data suggest that people punish
   candidates for infidelity more for those candidates whose spouse leaves
   them. Further, the effects on candidate and spousal evaluations are
   conditional on candidate and participant partisanship. The electoral
   consequences of political scandals involving cheating candidates go
   beyond the candidates' choices.},

Title = {Assessing electoral coordination: A quasi-experimental design of changes
   in district magnitude over time},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 15},
Abstract = {This paper examines the impact of district magnitude, defined as the
   number of representatives elected per district, on the number of
   political parties. Conventional wisdom, supported by cross-national and
   within-country studies, indicates a positive and curvilinear
   relationship between district magnitude and the number of parties, with
   diminishing returns in larger-magnitude districts. However, this
   relationship is complicated by the increasing regionalization of party
   systems and the distinct socio-economic compositions of districts
   correlated with district magnitude. To address these limitations and
   obtain an appropriate counterfactual, we employ a quasi-experimental
   design using data from Spain, where district magnitude changes by only
   one seat in some districts and elections. Our findings align with
   previous research, confirming that the number of electoral parties
   increases with district magnitude, particularly in low-magnitude
   districts.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the effect of priming the existence of corrupt
   connections to the bureaucracy and of trusted references on the demand
   for intermediary services. We performed an experimental survey with
   undergraduate students in Caracas, Venezuela. Participants are presented
   with a hypothetical situation in which they need to obtain the apostille
   of their professional degrees in order to migrate and are considering
   whether to hire an intermediary ({''}gestor{''}) or not. The survey
   randomly reveals the existence of an illicit connection between the
   gestor and the bureaucracy and whether a trusted individual referred the
   intermediary. Our findings are not consistent with the ``market
   maker{''} hypothesis that revealing the existence of illicit connections
   increases demand. Consistent with the view that trust is a key element
   in inherently opaque transactions, we find that the demand for
   intermediaries is price inelastic when gestores are referred by trusted
   individuals.},

Title = {ecolRxC: Ecological inference estimation of R x C tables using latent
   structure approaches},
Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 14},
Abstract = {Ecological inference is a statistical technique used to infer individual
   behavior from aggregate data. A particularly relevant instance of
   ecological inference involves the estimation of the inner cells of a set
   of R x C related contingency tables when only their aggregate margins
   are known. This problem spans multiple disciplines, including
   quantitative history, epidemiology, political science, marketing, and
   sociology. This paper proposes new models for solving the problem using
   the latent structure theory, and presents the ecolRxC package, an R
   implementation of this methodology. This article exemplifies, explains,
   and statistically documents the new extensions and, using real inner
   cell election data, shows how the new models in ecolRxC lead to
   significantly more accurate solutions than ecol and VTR, two Stata
   routines suggested within this framework. ecolRxC also holds its own
   against ei.MD.bayes and nslphom, the two algorithms currently identified
   in the literature as the most accurate to solve this problem. ecolRxC
   records accuracies as good as those reported for ei.MD.bayes and
   nslphom. Besides, from a theoretical perspective, ecolRxC stands up for
   modeling a causal theory of political behavior to build its algorithm.
   This distinguishes it from other procedures proposed from different
   frameworks (such as ei.MD.bayes and nslphom) which model expected
   behaviors, instead of modeling how voters make choices based on their
   underlying preferences as ecolRxC does.},

Abstract = {The modern state is often taken as the only legitimate claimant to the
   division of the globe. Political theorists offer many theories of
   territorial rights but tend to agree that the state remains the proper
   institutional bearer of such rights. This article examines how states
   became the exclusive bearers of territorial rights by returning to the
   international theory of the eighteenth-century Prussian jurist Christian
   Wolff (1679-1754), who wrote in a moment when sovereign states were not
   the heirs apparent to the globe but competed with other claimants to
   territorial rights. Despite proposing a radically pluralistic and
   anti-imperial account of land ownership, Wolff nonetheless paved the way
   for the state to become the sole bearer of territorial rights. Wolff's
   international thought is an illustration of how building a state-centric
   international order was a double-edged sword: it criticized imperial
   overreach while also closing the international arena to nonstate forms
   of collective life. In this process, he offered two distinct ideas of
   political space: the territorial space of states, and the land ownership
   tracts of nonstate peoples, including pastoralists and nomads. To Wolff,
   only states were entitled to full and permanent territorial rights,
   while nonstate peoples were shut out of the international system, made
   both de facto and de jure stateless.},

Abstract = {Does gender affect candidate selection and list placement under
   proportional representation (PR)? Existing research argues that PR
   systems have a positive effect on women's representation due to a more
   inclusive candidate selection process. However, analysing the actual
   process of candidate selection under PR before observing the final party
   list is challenging, and little is known about the preferences and
   strategies of party elites when selecting and ranking candidates. To
   address this lacuna, we conduct a novel two-stage conjoint experiment
   with party elites in Austria, which allows us to differentiate between
   two distinct mechanisms in candidate nomination under PR: selection and
   ranking. Our findings indicate that women generally have an advantage
   with respect to selection but find themselves subject to same-sex
   preferences when it comes to ranking on the list, for which they
   otherwise benefit from being low in supply. These findings have
   important implications for understanding patterns of female
   under-representation in PR systems.},

Title = {Drivers of differentiation between EU Member-states in the UN General
   Assembly},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},
Pages = {834-850},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) has laboured hard to gain the right to make oral
   interventions in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in pursuit
   of a more active international role. At the same time, though, EU
   member-states continue to take the floor to make their own
   interventions, thus differentiating - but not necessarily distancing -
   their stance from the officially expressed EU position. In that respect,
   it is important to examine the drivers behind the differentiating
   activity of EU member-states and their engagement in UNGA deliberations.
   We identify structural, institutional, political and thematic drivers.
   They relate to resources, the EU system of external representation in
   the form of the EU rotating Council Presidency and the opportunities
   that it provides during each country's period in office, national
   political aspirations for greater influence, as well as issue-specific
   assertiveness. We operationalize and control for these drivers by
   looking at the size and economic resources of EU member-states, their
   individual statements while holding the EU rotating Council Presidency,
   their membership in the UN Security Council (UNSC) or candidacy for it,
   and the issue specificity of each UNGA Main Committee. Our analysis is
   based on a three-level longitudinal multilevel random intercept model
   and relies upon a new dataset that compiles the oral interventions made
   by representatives of EU member-states and by EU officials in UNGA
   through an automated content analysis of the verbatim records of the
   UNGA meetings from 1998 to 2017.},

Abstract = {If policies make politics, can they also make politicians? We argue that
   being a bureaucrat with discretion over policy benefits can catalyze
   political ambitions and boost electoral success. As agents of the state
   rather than parties or interest groups, such bureaucrats wield a broadly
   accepted political currency. We examine the political careers of
   Brazilian bureaucrats who issue DAPs, a document granting benefits to
   small farmers. Leveraging a panel analysis from 2004 to 2020, we show
   that as bureaucrats issue more DAPs, they are more likely to become
   candidates, gain votes, and win election. DAP issuers run for office at
   higher rates than other public-facing bureaucrats with less control over
   policy benefits, suggesting that discretion is the key political
   currency, not social status or public contact. Our analysis underscores
   how the adoption of means-tested social policies can create new sources
   of political capital and brokerage in areas long dominated by
   traditional elites.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 1},
Abstract = {Mearsheimer and Rosato's How States Think argues rational foreign policy
   decision-making proceeds from deliberations whereby state actors link
   credible theories regarding policies' effects to states' strategic ends.
   Mearsheimer and Rosato's emphasis on the importance of theories in the
   minds of state decision-makers, and their willingness to consider the
   state as an important ``unit level{''} variable in international
   politics, establishes a unique position in international relations
   theory. However, their procedural definition of rationality is at odds
   with their recognition that irrational outcomes may result from actions
   that are based on credible, but inaccurate theories that fail to predict
   foreign policy decisions' consequences. Rather than emphasizing
   deliberative rationality, key features of international politics are
   better understood as being caused by the limited forms of policy
   experimentation states can engage in, and the corresponding difficulties
   in identifying the accuracy of rival theories. Hardly due to poor
   incentives or various psychological biases, these limits are due to the
   monopolistic properties of state authority, and the corresponding limits
   to experimenting with the rival theories that foreign policy elites hold
   regarding the international environment.},

Title = {THE UNDERSTANDING OF TOLERATION OF YOUNG LEIBNIZ},

Abstract = {This article clarifies Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's understanding of
   toleration, a topic that has become controversial in the last few
   decades. For the purpose of brevity and exactness, only his writings and
   letters dating from the beginning of his philosophical thought (1668 to
   1676) are analysed, while the main focus is on Leibniz's understanding
   of political toleration, or the relation of the state towards the
   existence of confessions (i.e., churches or denominations) different
   than the ruler's. The article investigates the understanding of
   toleration in the 17th-century Holy Roman Empire, which turns out to be
   the sufferance of difference rather than its affirmation or celebration,
   as well as the historical context of tolerating different confessions in
   various states of the 17th-century Empire. While indirect evidence is
   shown that Leibniz favoured toleration in confessionally mixed German
   states, the main point of the article is that young Leibniz cannot be
   counted among the proponents of toleration only if his vision of
   politically and ecclesiastically united Empire didn't tolerate further
   existence of differing confessions. Based on the analysis of the
   memorandum Securitas Publica from 1670, it is conclusively shown that
   Leibniz was in favour of toleration of differing confessions even in the
   united Empire that he envisioned. The last part of the article explains
   Leibniz's attitude towards ``atheism{''} on the cases of celebrated
   philosophers which were widely perceived as atheists in the learned
   world of the time, namely Thomas Hobbes and Baruch Spinoza. It is
   concluded that the relation of young Leibniz to them and their work
   cannot be characterized as intolerant or censorious.},

Abstract = {What effect did infrastructure expansion have on state coercive
   capacity? A growing body of literature ties infrastructure-particularly
   for communication and transportation-to increased state capacity and
   control. Yet, the same infrastructure that extends the reach of the
   state simultaneously alters local contexts in ways that may unravel
   social control and enable resistance to state-led coercion. Drawing on
   novel time series cross-sectional data on draft evasion in French West
   Africa-a measure of resistance to coercive policies-this article
   demonstrates that railway expansion did not neatly increase the colonial
   regime's ability to monitor the population and effectively extract
   conscripts. Railway infrastructure disrupted many of the economic and
   social conditions that enabled coercion, including legibility and local
   compliance. Railways drove displacement and urbanization, altered
   opportunity costs and incentivized everyday resistance, and opened
   possibilities for exit. By heightening mobility and undermining
   conditions of social control, railroads were associated with higher
   draft evasion.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigate how eco-social attitudes are interlinked
   with various modes of political action aimed at preventing environmental
   change and promoting social welfare. Using multiple correspondence
   analysis and cluster analysis, we explore the links between attitudes
   and political action, and associated socio-political characteristics, in
   the case of Sweden. Our results show a three-node pattern forming a
   political action triangle: individuals expressing joint support for
   social welfare and environmental concerns are most actively engaged in
   political action, while those supporting environmental concerns are
   sympathetic to take part in political action without actually
   participating, and those supporting social welfare or expressing low
   support for either set of concerns seem overly reluctant towards all
   types of political action. This pattern, which is also tied to
   distinctive socio-political characteristics, has wider implications for
   understanding the agency and the mobilization of support for tackling
   the multiple ecological and social crises contemporary societies are
   facing.},

Abstract = {While people use the term `mainstream' on a regular basis, there has
   been relatively little discussion about what it actually means. Within
   far-right studies, attempts to define the mainstream often center around
   party politics and the impact of mainstream party strategies on the far
   right. While a useful starting point, this focus has led to more rigid
   conceptions which encourage particular normative assumptions about its
   identity. Through poststructuralist discourse theory, supported by
   insights from music studies and critical discourse studies, this article
   proposes a definition which accounts for its contingency and
   construction, challenging dominant narratives about its nature. These
   issues are crucial when we consider the relationship between the
   mainstream and far right because they encourage us to question their
   perceived relative positioning. By introducing the concepts of talking
   `with' and `about' the far right, this piece establishes the need for us
   to take the role of the mainstream in the mainstreaming of the far right
   seriously.},

Title = {The conditional effects of party system change on economic growth in
   Africa},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 27},
Abstract = {African party systems vary considerably in their patterns of stability
   and change over time. This article examines how economic growth has been
   shaped by such party system fluidity-in particular, the frequency, scope
   and variety of change-while taking account of the constitutional regime
   (i.e., level of democracy) within which these party system dynamics
   occur. To do so, we use Arellano-Bond generalized method of moments
   models to test the impact of party system fluidity and the level of
   democracy on economic growth in Africa during the post-independence
   period (1970-2018). We find, consistent with previous research, that
   democracy has an uncertain effect on growth. However, party system
   fluidity is reliably and positively correlated with growth. Its effects
   are particularly strong whenever an unstable party system coexists with
   an autocratic regime, which suggests that this specific political
   context-which has often been associated with democratization-is
   especially conducive to economic growth.},

Abstract = {Although extensive research has been conducted on the extreme right (ER)
   and radical right (RR), their foreign policy remains understudied.
   Hence, we provide a comparative analysis of 42 ER and RR parties in
   Europe to identify their stances on two key issues of contemporary
   international politics: the Israeli-Palestinian and the Russia-Ukraine
   conflicts. The results suggest that ER and RR parties do not choose who
   to like but who to hate more: either Israel (Jews) or Palestine
   (Muslims); either Russia or the West (and Ukraine as its proxy).
   However, ER and RR parties are substantially different in their
   positions towards both conflicts, and a stance in one conflict
   corresponds to a specific position in the other: the ER tends to be
   supportive of Palestine and Russia, while the RR supportive of Israel
   and Ukraine. We argue that these profound differences are due to a
   combination of ideological and competitive incentives.
   Obwohl die extreme Rechte und die radikale Rechte umfassend erforscht
   wurden, wissen wir noch wenig \& uuml;ber ihre Au ss enpolitiken. Dieser
   Artikel erbringt eine vergleichende Analyse von 42 Parteien der extremen
   und radikalen Rechten in Europa und ermittelt deren Haltung zu zwei
   gegenw \& auml;rtigen internationalen Konflikten: den Konflikten
   zwischen Israel und Pal \& auml;stina und zwischen Russland und der
   Ukraine. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Parteien der extremen und der
   radikalen Rechten weniger ausw \& auml;hlen, wen sie m \& ouml;gen,
   sondern eher, wen sie mehr hassen: Israel (Juden) oder Pal \& auml;stina
   (Muslime); Russland oder den Westen (die Ukraine als Stellvertreter).
   Jedoch unterscheiden sich die Positionen der extremen und der radikalen
   rechten Parteien zu beiden Konflikten erheblich. Eine Haltung zu dem
   einen Konflikt entspricht zudem einer bestimmten Haltung zum anderen
   Konflikt: Extrem rechte Parteien unterst \& uuml;tzen tendenziell Pal \&
   auml;stina und Russland, radikale rechte Parteien Israel und die
   Ukraine. Diese gewichtigen Unterschiede sind auf eine Kombination aus
   ideologischen und Wettbewerbsanreizen zur \& uuml;ckzuf \& uuml;hren.
   Bien que de nombreuses recherches aient \& eacute;t \& eacute; men \&
   eacute;es sur l'extr \& ecirc;me droite et la droite radicale, leurs
   politiques \& eacute;trang \& egrave;res restent peu \& eacute;tudi \&
   eacute;es. Nous proposons une analyse comparative de 42 partis de l'extr
   \& ecirc;me droite et de la droite radicale en Europe afin d'identifier
   leurs positions sur deux conflits cl \& eacute;s de la politique
   internationale contemporaine: celui entre Isra \& euml;l et la Palestine
   et celui entre la Russie et l'Ukraine. Les r \& eacute;sultats sugg \&
   egrave;rent que les partis de l'extr \& ecirc;me droite et de la droite
   radicale ne choisissent pas qui aimer mais qui ha \& iuml;r le plus:
   Isra \& euml;l (Juifs) ou Palestine (Musulmans); la Russie ou l'Occident
   (et l'Ukraine comme son mandataire). Cependant, les partis de l'extr \&
   ecirc;me droite et de la droite radicale sont fondamentalement diff \&
   eacute;rents dans leurs positions vis-\& agrave;-vis des deux conflits,
   et une position sur un conflit correspond \& agrave; une position sp \&
   eacute;cifique sur l'autre: l'extr \& ecirc;me droite a tendance \&
   agrave; soutenir la Palestine et la Russie tandis que la droite radicale
   soutient Isra \& euml;l et l'Ukraine. Nous soutenons que ces diff \&
   eacute;rences profondes sont dues \& agrave; une combinaison
   d'incitations id \& eacute;ologiques et concurrentielles.
   Sebbene siano state condotte numerose ricerche sull'estrema destra e
   sulla destra radicale, la loro politica estera rimane poco studiata.
   Partendo da tale costa articolo offre un'analisi comparata di 42 partiti
   di estrema destra e di destra radicale in Europa al fine di identificare
   le loro posizioni su due questioni chiave della politica internazionale
   contemporanea: i conflitti israelo-palestinese e russo-ucraino. I
   risultati dimostrano che i partiti di estrema destra e di destra
   radicale non scelgono tanto chi amare ma piuttosto chi odiare di pi \&
   ugrave;: Israele (ebrei) o Palestina (musulmani); la Russia o
   l'Occidente (e l'Ucraina come suo proxy). Questi partiti sono
   sostanzialmente diversi nelle loro posizioni nei confronti di entrambi i
   conflitti, e una posizione in un conflitto corrisponde a una posizione
   specifica nell'altro: l'estrema destra tende a sostenere la Palestina e
   la Russia, mentre la destra radicale sostiene Israele e l'Ucraina.
   Riteniamo che queste profonde differenze siano dovute a una combinazione
   di incentivi legati all'ideologia e a una questione di concorrenza.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the impact of factionalism on the survival of
   social movements under state repression. Shifting the focus from
   mobilisation to survival as the dependent variable, it proposes a theory
   that maximalist movements with high factionalism are more likely to
   survive repression than seemingly unified movements due to their
   capacity for resource and tactic diversification. Utilising the NAVCO
   2.1 dataset, this research tests the proposed theory and evaluates two
   alternative explanations: repression severity and movement violence.
   Survival analysis and logistic regression models suggest that greater
   factionalism enhances movement survival, while repression severity and
   movement violence have no significant effect. These findings challenge
   conventional wisdom and highlight the potential benefits of factionalism
   for movement resilience. It discusses additional dimensions of
   repression and their potential interactive effects with factionalism to
   further elucidate the complex dynamics of the repression-survival
   relationship.},

Abstract = {As drones become more ubiquitous on and off the battlefield, the
   emerging field of drone forensics is increasingly important to global
   security. Drone forensics entails investigating, collecting and
   preserving critical information regarding a drone, its operation and how
   it was used, through scientific methodologies, for use in law
   enforcement, national security or other investigations. It may involve
   recovering flight parameters around where, when and at what altitude the
   drone flew; tracing the origins of drone components; or recovering
   fingerprints. Drone forensics can help: defenders build better drone
   countermeasures; law enforcement agencies detect and deter crimes;
   states establish and enforce sanctions; militaries adopt pre-emptive and

Abstract = {Latin America has seen both recurrent crises and a surprising resilience
   of its regional organizations. This article explores how different
   approaches have attempted to explain this seemingly paradoxical record.
   Combining insights from European Union (EU) studies and comparative
   regionalism, we ask whether neofunctionalism as a theoretical approach
   developed for the study of the EU can travel across the Atlantic and
   enrich the analysis of Latin American regionalism. Neofunctionalist
   theorists posited that functional spillover could lead to politicization
   and subsequent deepening of regional integration. But while spillover
   has been the engine of European integration, it has never been a real
   option in Latin America. Past applications of neofunctionalist
   approaches to Latin American regionalism have therefore above all
   revealed its limitations. Comparative regionalism approaches fared
   better in that they identified characteristics that account for the
   repeated crises of Latin American regional organizations. However, this
   article suggests that the ``second-best{''} strategies mentioned in
   neofunctionalist analyses, such as encapsulation, spill-around, or even
   spillback, can help explain the resilience of regionalism in Latin
   America. While those strategies posed an obstacle to deeper integration,
   as shown by classical neofunctionalist studies, we draw on a set of case
   studies to illustrate that Latin American regionalism survived through
   expansion (spill-around) rather than deepening (spillover), as well as
   through encapsulation and, in some cases, even spillback. A new reading
   of neofunctionalism therefore helps to explain the resilience of Latin
   American regionalism under adverse conditions.},

   networks intersect},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 12},
Abstract = {Amid rapid urbanization in the developing world, there is growing
   interest in the effects of urban context on political behavior. An
   underexplored element of urban context is the built environment
   itself-the physical architecture and design of urban space-which can
   structure how residents interact both with each other and with the
   state. Drawing on street network data and an original survey from urban
   Ghana, I suggest that more gridded, orderly neighborhoods reduce the
   social interactions residents have with neighbors, lower embeddedness in
   political problem-solving networks, and depress electoral turnout.
   Rather than making residents more legible to state officials, gridded
   streets make the local state and political realm less legible to
   residents by reducing opportunities to forge politically valuable social
   ties in a context of clientelist politics. The paper demonstrates that
   greater focus is needed on built environments to understand the social
   structures undergirding grassroots urban politics.},

Title = {Development and Validation of the Political Brand Positioning \&
   Marketing Scale: A Study in Pakistan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 10},
Abstract = {Positioning is the process of establishing and maintaining voters'
   perceptions, connections, and images of a political brand based on the
   values and beliefs associated with it through clear, consistent, and
   coherent marketing communication. However, there is no scale available
   that can be used to measure the effects of political brand positioning
   and marketing efforts. Then, this study aims to develop and validate a
   new method - the Political Brand Positioning \& Marketing Scale. This
   will be done in the political context of Pakistan. It is expected that
   by using this method, researchers, political consultants, and political
   brand managers will be able to reflect on their brand image formulations
   and positioning strategies. It will also help them strengthen their
   contact with voters and the public to increase the quality of election
   campaigns and determine whether the brand image and perception are
   compatible with what was planned.},

Title = {Care, democracy and `being part of the story'},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 9},
Abstract = {Standard notions of democracy assume people's equality. This poses a
   dilemma for conceptualising democracy in the context of caregiving and
   receiving among asymmetrically positioned people. One way to overcome
   this dilemma is to generalise dependency as a universal human condition.
   However, addressing how democracy is possible among unequally situated
   people is necessary for developing a distinctive theory of democracy
   that takes the fact of human dependency seriously. To this end, I
   develop an expanded conception of democracy that goes beyond the
   individual exercise of voice to that of interacting with others
   according to an ethic of care that supports the autonomy of others.
   Drawing on Hannah Arendt's notion of a `common world' as a web of
   narratives arising from the complex interaction of plural perspectives,
   I argue that democracy conceived as `being part of the story' can foster
   such an ethic. This has practical relevance for societies where the
   sites of social cooperation are shifting from employment to care.},

Abstract = {The root causes, nature and impact of Indonesian women's involvement in
   terrorism has yet to influence Indonesian Counter Terrorism (CT) and
   Preventing Violent Extremism (PVE) policies. Through a feminist
   discourse analysis of semi-structured interviews with 28 Indonesian
   government representatives, this article argues that Indonesian CT and
   PVE policies continue to rely on gender stereotypes rather than
   addressing the gendered realities of Indonesian women's relationship
   with violent extremism. This reflects broader global discourses
   regarding women and terrorism but are shaped by unique religious,
   cultural, political and historical influences within the Indonesian
   context - the Indonesian gender order. This article finds that the
   stereotypes - depicting female extremists as immature, brainwashed and
   poor - lead to a generalised applicability of the one-size-fits-all
   approach of income generation, overlooking female extremists'
   culpability, focusing on protection of ``women and children{''},
   neglecting the roles diverse actors in CT and PVE efforts, and
   reinforcing the Indonesian gender order.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the delegitimation of the Other in selected messages
   of Boko Haram (BH), using seven of the messages delivered by the
   longest-serving BH leader, Abubakar Shekau. The messages delivered
   during Shekau's period as the BH leader between 2009 and 2021, were
   identified using f4analyse as a coding tool and discussed analytically
   using Theo van Leeuwen's Discourse Legitimation approach to discourse
   analysis. The analysis unearths Shekau's deployment of four
   delegitimation strategies: authorisation, moralisation, rationalisation
   and mythopoesis to discredit the actions and practices of the Other -
   those who do not associate with BH. The four delegitimation strategies
   are linguistically realised through negative other-presentation
   strategy. The messages deployed polarisation, other-condemnation,
   other-blaming, negative tagging (derogatory labelling/nomination) of
   anti-BH, other-exclusivity in perceived positive contexts,
   metaphorising, hyperbolising and euphemising to accentuate in-group
   consensus and in-group solidarity. The strategies are deployed to
   negatively represent the Other in order to delegitimise their actions,
   beliefs and principles.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the intrinsic relationship between life, power,
   and critique of power. It considers the key-role played by the concept
   of human life in critical theory, as a qualitative tool for the critique
   of oppressive social contexts, and questions the severance instituted by
   Axel Honneth's theory of recognition between an inter-objective and an
   inter-subjective approach to human life. Firstly, I show that according
   to the concept of life adopted a certain conception of power and a
   certain diagnostic capacity of the critique of power follow, and that
   the separation between an inter-objective and an inter-subjective
   approach to the concept of life results in mutual critical
   inefficiencies. Secondly, I support the importance of bringing the
   concept of nature back to the centre of an intersubjective conception of
   human life, while keeping in mind the contemporary risks and
   requirements of such a concept. To this end, I finally argue that the
   naturalistic and intersubjective concept of human life outlined by John
   Dewey can be a point of departure to overcome the severance between
   nature and recognition, disclosing important perspectives for the
   critical analysis of the ``lives{''} of power.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The City of Rosario has faced an increase in violence and
   crime related to organized crime, especially drug trafficking, in recent
   years. In response to this situation, the Ministry of National Security
   implemented an intervention model in 2020 that involved the creation of
   a ministerial delegation and an increase in the presence of federal
   security forces, as part of a plan aimed at dismantling and defunding
   criminal organizations. Objective: In this regard, this paper aims to
   analyze the state capacities of this delegation to address the issue
   based on two main dimensions: political and administrative capacities.
   Methodology: The case analysis is exploratory and descriptive, with a
   qualitative approach. Conclusions: A detailed analysis of both samples
   shows that the Ministry's capacities have been low and have not
   generally met the previously set objectives.},

Abstract = {The demand side of populism has been in the scope of social scientists
   since the early 2010s. Since then, ample scholarly evidence has
   suggested that populist attitudes are strongly tied to the feeling of
   relative deprivation. Our study's focal point revolves around the above
   findings and focuses on Hungary, a country where populism flourishes.
   This study analyses the possible connections between the populist
   attitudes of Hungarian citizens and their feelings of relative
   deprivation using a representative sample (n = 994). Regression analyses
   revealed that relative deprivation is a significant predictor of
   populist attitudes in Hungary regardless of age, sex, and education.},

Abstract = {Introduction: This document offers an approach to the primary challenges
   and vulnerabilities of liberal globalization, stemming from the tensions
   generated by China's growing influence in strategic sectors and the
   relative decoupling process undertaken by Western powers. Objective: The
   objective is to understand how and why global supply chains,
   particularly those related to semiconductors, have emerged as the new
   geopolitical battleground between Western powers and China. Methodology:
   The analysis is based on a systematic review of various sources that
   address the current risks facing global supply chains for the
   development of key technologies in the competition between major powers.
   Conclusions: The article concludes that the geopolitics of global supply
   chains and the securitization of China reveal an exhausted economic
   globalization system undergoing transformation, which no longer appears
   to serve the interests of Western powers.},

Abstract = {This research examines the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on
   Russian hegemony in the post-Soviet sphere (Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and
   Armenia). Hegemony is conceptualized through coercion, consent, and
   attraction. The study concludes that while Russia positions itself as a
   hegemon in the post-Soviet domain, its military actions in Ukraine are
   undermining its hegemonic status. Rather than enhancing its potential,
   the invasion of Ukraine has led to a drain of material resources and
   diminished Russia's capacity to engender consensus among those it seeks
   to lead. Russia is also losing its attractiveness for potential
   followers in the region.},

Abstract = {A growing body of literature highlights the benefits of using classroom
   games to help students understand policy concepts. In practice, however,
   instructors often use games as ad-hoc activities to increase student
   engagement, rather than as an integrated way to consolidate student
   understanding of core course topics. The goal of this paper is to help
   instructors design and systematically integrate games into their
   undergraduate policy courses. Drawing on our experiences as instructors
   and researchers, we describe how we developed a sequence of games to
   help undergraduate students understand three of the core concepts in
   environmental policy, and how we integrated them into our undergraduate
   courses on environmental policy. We then provide a basic framework for
   instructors who are interested in designing games that illustrate core
   policy concepts by simulating real-world policy interactions.},

Abstract = {The United States has a longstanding tradition regarding its overall
   foreign policy, in the form of a bipartisan consensus. This
   includes-among other things-maintaining alliances and curbing the
   influence of rivals (e.g., Russia). Since this consensus has been in
   place, traditionally the Republican Party (GOP) has been especially
   intent on a less cooperative and more containing or deterring stance
   towards Russia. With former U.S. President Donald Trump, we can see a
   turning point in this behaviour by the GOP. Trump's obvious admiration
   for Russian president Putin and his statements about Putin being overly
   favourable, while simultaneously questioning NATO and the United States'
   commitment to defend Eastern European partners, show a distinctive shift
   in the GOP's discourse. This renunciation has subsequently been picked
   up by parts of the Republican Party, rendering the bipartisan consensus
   a contested issue. The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in
   February 2022 now constitutes an important external shock influencing
   said discursive shift. By drawing on discourse-bound identity theory and
   discourse analysis, the GOP's discourse regarding Russia and NATO is
   expected to have (substantially) changed in a kind of Zeitenwende-back
   towards the bipartisan consensus. This article will, therefore, analyse
   the statements of prominent Republicans after the Russian invasion,
   compare them to Trump's positions on these issues, and identify whether
   the invasion serves as a formative event that creates an overall shift
   in rhetoric and positions.
   Die USA haben eine langanhaltende Tradition in ihrer allgemeinen Au ss
   enpolitik, in Form des sog. ,,bipartisan consensus{''}. Darin enthalten
   sind u. a. das Erhalten von Allianzen und die Einschr \& auml;nkung des
   Einflusses von Rivalen (bspw. Russlands). Seit dieser Konsens existiert,
   verfolgen die Republikaner traditionellerweise einen weniger
   kooperativen, eher einhegenden und abschreckenden Kurs gegen \& uuml;ber
   Russland. Mit dem fr \& uuml;heren US-Pr \& auml;sidenten Trump kann man
   hier eine Wende im Verhalten der Partei erkennen. Die Verschiebung des
   Republikanischen Diskurses zeigt sich klar mit seiner offensichtlichen
   Bewunderung f \& uuml;r Russlands Pr \& auml;sident Putin und seinen
   lobenden Aussagen \& uuml;ber diesen, w \& auml;hrend er die NATO und
   die Verteidigungspflicht gegen \& uuml;ber osteurop \& auml;ischen
   Partnern hinterfragt. Diese Abkehr von fr \& uuml;heren Positionen wurde
   daraufhin von Teilen der Republikanischen Partei \& uuml;bernommen,
   wodurch der bisherige ,,bipartisan consensus{''} contestet wird. Die
   russische Invasion der Ukraine im Februar 2022 stellt hierbei nun einen
   entscheidenden externen Schock dar, der diesen diskursiven Wandel
   beeinflussen kann. Unter der Einbeziehung der diskursgebundenen Identit
   \& auml;tstheorie und einer Diskursanalyse wird davon ausgegangen, dass
   sich der Republikanische Diskurs zu Russland und der NATO (erheblich)
   gewandelt hat - zur \& uuml;ck zum ,,bipartisan consensus{''} in einer
   Art Zeitenwende. Daf \& uuml;r werden in diesem Artikel Aussagen
   relevanter Republikaner:innen nach der russischen Invasion analysiert,
   mit den Positionen Trumps zu diesen Themen verglichen und festgestellt,
   ob es sich demnach um ein formatives Ereignis handelt, durch das ein
   genereller Wandel in Rhetorik und Einstellungen entsteht.},

Abstract = {What is the relationship between electoral manipulation and postelection
   protests in Latin America? The political science literature has
   traditionally expected that election manipulation can lead to
   postelection demonstrations, but the research has not dealt much with
   how the elections were manipulated. This study aims to fill this gap. An
   analysis of 221 elections in Latin America between 1980 and 2020 shows
   that the relationship between electoral manipulation and postelection
   protests is far more complex than conventional explanations suggest. The
   results show that pre-election manipulation does not increase the
   likelihood of postelection protests. Regarding manipulation during
   elections, it appears that citizens of Latin American countries are
   susceptible to administrative fraud. Contrary to previous studies,
   intimidation and vote buying also have no effect.},

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {The theory of the ``personal vote{''} assumes that constituent service,
   or the process by which members of Congress help their constituents
   navigate the federal bureaucracy, is a component of representation that
   transcends partisanship. However, recent research suggests that
   affective polarization and negative partisanship may discourage
   constituents from reaching out to ask for help from cross-partisan
   legislators. Using a conjoint experiment, I show that shared
   partisanship has a strong effect on constituents' decisions about which
   of their legislators to contact for assistance. However, positive
   in-party affect is unrelated to these preferences, suggesting that
   negative partisanship is responsible for this result. Gender and
   seniority also matter for constituents' preferences even when accounting
   for shared partisanship. The results suggest that legislators' ability
   to build a ``personal vote{''} by performing constituent service may be
   weakened in an era of strong partisanship.},

Abstract = {Does supporting a minority cabinet harm a party's electoral prospects?
   While minority governments have become more common in recent years, the
   electoral implications for parties supporting such cabinets remain
   unclear. Previous research suggests that support parties enjoy a
   favorable position, exerting policy influence while avoiding electoral
   losses associated with joining the government. However, we argue that
   this is only true for support parties without written agreements, as
   their support is less visible to voters. To test our argument, we
   compiled a novel dataset on the electoral performance of 563 parties in
   304 elections across 31 countries since 1980. We estimate the effect of
   being a support party on subsequent electoral performance. Our findings
   indicate that parties which declare support perform better electorally
   than junior partners, while contract support parties do not. These
   insights shed light on the relationship between minority governments and
   electoral competition amidst growing party system fragmentation.},

Title = {An examination of capitalism's influence on student affairs labor in
   higher education},
Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 8},
Abstract = {This essay aims to uncover capitalism's influence over student affairs
   labor in higher education, by which is meant the labor of non-faculty,
   student-facing professionals on collegiate campuses globally. It
   contrasts with works foregrounding neoliberal analyses of the
   profession, which tend to show the impacts of neoliberal capitalism on
   student affairs labor in the present, disembodied from the whole of the
   capitalist system. With assistance from Marx's notion of contradiction
   (derived from his dialectical approach), this essay reveals how
   capitalism's influence on American higher educational institutions
   transformed the faculty role and paved the way for student affairs to
   come into existence. The use of Marx's value-form helps explain the
   nature of student affairs practitioners' labor as abstract. Following
   that, this work establishes student affairs labor as producing the
   labor-power commodity for capitalism and implements Marx's subsumption
   categories to identify the ideal subsumption of student affairs labor.
   To conclude, there is brief discussion of an alternative to the current
   neoliberal university and student affairs labors' place within it.
   Achieving this alternative will require political struggle against
   capitalism and organizing for the common.},

Abstract = {The ``modern{''} gender vote gap - where women are generally more
   supportive of left parties than men - is established in many Western
   democracies. Whilst it is linked to societal changes, and in particular
   the transformation of gender roles and relations, scholars still grapple
   with its underlying mechanisms. This paper tests one mechanism currently
   untested in existing accounts: that women's specific experiences in less
   traditional social statuses - in employment, education, or out of
   marriage - drive their support for the left. Analyses using German,
   Swiss, and English panel data do show differences in left party support
   between men and women, and amongst women, according to these social
   statuses. However, we do not find evidence that these occur because of
   these experiences directly. Rather, our findings indicate that
   left-leaning women self-select into certain life trajectories. This
   suggests that women's shifting political views due to societal change
   have corresponding changes in individual life choices.},

Abstract = {Contrary to the recent argument developed by Matthew Kramer, edificatory
   perfectionism is an integral part of the purpose of the state and as
   such is required by justice. This claim can be supported by an
   appropriate understanding of the common good and the principle of
   subsidiarity. The purpose of the state rests in its duty to secure for
   its citizens the common good, which is a set of conditions under which
   all individuals and associations can attain for themselves various
   reasonable goods or cooperate together to attain them. This includes
   perfectionist goods, such as living in a favourable moral environment.
   The relationship between the common good and justice is clarified by the
   application of the principle of subsidiarity. Its negative formulation
   is well known as a principle limiting the government's competence. I
   draw attention to the positive formulation, which mandates that the
   state is obliged to assist when individuals and communities cannot
   achieve their reasonable goals, including perfectionist ones, by
   themselves. This obligation, though enabling perfectionist actions, is
   still limited by prudential considerations and plurality of intrinsic
   goods which requires respect for personal freedom.},

   reverse election setbacks - evidence from Turkey and Israel},

Year = {2025},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Through a comparative study of Turkey and Israel, this article
   highlights a specific strategy that autocratizing populist incumbents in
   ethnically divided societies utilize when they face election setbacks. A
   ``blood gambit{''} entails fomenting violent conflict to keep the
   opposition divided along identitarian cleavages, while creating a
   rally-around-the-flag effect to help the incumbent win a renewed
   election. After failing to secure a parliamentary majority in June 2015,
   Erdo \& gbreve;an ended the Kurdish peace process and engineered repeat
   elections amidst heightened nationalist fervour and renewed conflict
   with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). These elections gave the
   Justice and Development Party (AKP) a majority and marked the beginning
   of its alliance with the ultranationalists. Following Israel's March
   2021 elections, Netanyahu increased state repression of Palestinians,
   which triggered interethnic violence and renewed confrontation with
   Hamas. The violence threw a wrench into coalition-building efforts
   between ideologically and ethnically diverse opposition parties. The
   comparison of Israel and Turkey as two countries with different majority
   religions, ethnic compositions and socioeconomic levels shows that
   ``blood gambit{''} is not a parochial strategy. Our analysis also
   demonstrates that the outcomes of these strategies are shaped by
   differing institutional and political contexts, in particular, the
   extent of executive aggrandizement and the level of party fragmentation.},

Abstract = {Focusing on Germany and the United Kingdom as two most dissimilar cases
   in terms of labour market and political institutions, the article
   examines the impact of trade union membership on partisan preferences.
   Leveraging panel data to control for time-invariant selection effects
   shows that trade unions exert a small but consistent left-wing influence
   on wage earners who become affiliated, but they are no longer able to
   modify the preferences of working-class members. A longitudinal approach
   reveals that unions mainly attract individuals who already share the
   unions' political inclinations before joining. The additional shift to
   the left experienced by already left-leaning new members is consistent
   with a value congruence mechanism triggered by interactions with even
   more left-leaning long-term union members. Symmetrically, working-class
   joiners exhibit less pronounced left-wing inclinations before becoming
   affiliated, a gap that widens further after they join. These findings
   imply that unions' political influence and class allegiances have been
   both eroded and altered by changes in the labour market and political
   landscape.},

Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {49},
Number = {3},
Pages = {419-440},

Abstract = {In the last decade, repurchase-agreements (repos) between banks and
   financial institutions have grown significantly as banks systemically
   low on cash see repos as the cheapest, safest, and quickest way to get
   the funding they need for running regular services. However, hikes in
   interest rates by the Federal Reserve since March 2022 have increased
   the cost of interbank borrowing. This causes stress on many banks, and
   ultimately, brings into question the financial system's long-term
   reliance on repos and other obscure short-term funding methods.
   Awareness of the Fed's repo market policy, and their monetary policy in
   general, ought to matter to political economists and workers alike
   because it reveals precisely how the economy is controlled by a few
   levers inside the marriage between state and finance capital.
   Consequently, in this article I outline the repo market and its
   significance to the Fed's management of economic crises. This requires a
   relative understanding of their general monetary policy, which in itself
   requires significant material economic contextualizing. It is this
   context that ultimately matters most, and which will therefore be the
   focal point of discussion. Only after such contextualization does the
   discussion end with a word on the rise of repos, the risks of increased
   reliance on it, and possible future directions from the perspective of
   both capital and labor.},

Abstract = {This article examines the depiction of the Belt and Road Initiative
   (BRI) in elite English media across Europe to discern sentiments and
   ideological disparities between China and the Western world. Using the
   PRISMA method, 1826 relevant research articles on the BRI were
   identified, and 42 were selected for detailed analysis. Additionally,
   1357 news articles from the Financial Times, The Guardian and BBC from
   2015 to 2023 underwent linguistic corpus analysis. Employing a
   three-dimensional critical discourse analysis (3d-CDA), the study
   scrutinized sample news articles, revealing ideological underpinnings
   across various dimensions and frames. The analysis indicates a growing
   negativity towards the BRI in European English media, with sentiments
   averaging 38\% from 2015 to 2023 and peaking at 56\% and 54\% in 2022
   and 2023, respectively. Ideological differences often discussed in
   academic circles include a contrast between the emphasis on
   individualism in the West and the values of collectivism prominent in
   Chinese culture. However, it is important to recognize the diversity
   within these broad categories. This research offers insights for BRI
   stakeholders and enriches academic discourse with updated data. Its
   novelty lies in its dual-tiered approach to news relevance for content
   analysis and the application of three-dimensional CDA to BRI news
   discourse, revealing ideological disparities not previously explored.},

Title = {Experts replacing governments? The socio-cultural and authoritarian
   roots of citizens' preferences for experts in government in 58 countries},

Abstract = {Technocracy is seen as a solution to the political challenges of our
   time by an increasing number of citizens. Using survey data from the
   World Value Survey, this study confirms the existence of a positive
   inclination towards experts replacing politicians as policy-makers in
   both democratic and non-democratic countries. Confirming what we already
   knew about individual drivers, citizens with low political interest and
   trust appear to be more supportive of experts in government.
   Counter-intuitively, a preference for right-wing market capitalism does
   not affect attitudes towards experts in government. The novelty of this
   study is that an expert-led model of governance is particularly
   appealing to citizens who oppose immigration (social conservatism) and,
   above all, to those who favour social order and control over democracy
   (authoritarianism). The latter finding holds across continents,
   highlighting that support for experts in government has common roots
   among individuals living in very different contexts. Despite this common
   trend, the cross-continent analyses reveal important divergences from
   the pooled patterns for other individual-level drivers, calling for
   further exploration of contextual factors.},

Abstract = {Why do Republicans sometimes decline to enact voter suppression
   measures, even when contextual conditions (unified control of state
   government, electoral threats from Democrats, and racial threats from
   African American and Latinx voters) suggest that they should? We argue
   that ideological diversity within state Republican parties plays an
   important role in moderating Republican efforts to adopt policies that
   substantially increase the cost of voting. When a state Republican Party
   is more ideologically diverse, members may differ significantly on the
   preferred severity of voting restrictions and the priority of ballot
   restrictions relative to other issues. Thus, more heterogeneous
   Republican Parties may be less willing and able to institute voter
   suppression measures. In contrast, more ideologically unified Republican
   Parties face fewer barriers to collective action in advancing ballot
   restrictions, facilitating their adoption of voter suppression measures.
   We illustrate our arguments with case studies from Georgia and Alabama.},

Abstract = {News of Russian generals getting killed on the battlefields raises the
   question of whether a commander should lead an operation remotely,
   taking advantage of improved technical capabilities, or whether his
   presence close to the battlefield is necessary to meet the needs of his
   troops. The requirements of multi-domain operations and multi-domain
   integration call for command posts with enhanced capabilities along
   human, informational and physical dimensions. Unfortunately, these types
   of command posts have become very large, easily recognisable and
   vulnerable to attack. Alexander Kohli argues that commanders should not
   exclusively remain in remote command posts but should also provide
   support close to the front through personal contact with subordinate
   commanders and troops. Therefore, they must be able to rely on a command
   post concept encompassing several smaller forward and alternate command
   posts operating inconspicuously, yet capable of using a comprehensive
   command and control system.},

Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {The fact that physical activity (PA) is considered an important tool for
   promoting human health and a determinant of the right to health has
   contributed to the promotion of a separate human right to PA at the
   global level. This article compares the government policies and legal
   mechanisms for ensuring the right of citizens to health through PA in
   various EU member states and Ukraine. It has been established that in
   the absence of a single standard or conditions for implementing this
   right, the experiences of different European states are different in
   significant ways. According to our findings, the obstacles to ensuring
   the right of citizens to PA in Ukraine are due to (1) an inconsistent
   national development strategy, and adoption of unsystematic regulations
   without effective mechanisms for their practical implementation; (2) a
   lack of effective sectoral programs on PA for different social groups;
   (3) a low level of interest of the majority of citizens in PA as a means
   of promoting human health. The problem of realizing the rights of
   Ukrainian citizens has become much more acute due to the full-scale
   invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, starting in February
   2022.},

Abstract = {This essay explores cross-national patterns in state feminism, or
   women's policy agencies, in relation to broader trends in autonomous
   feminist organizing. The role and effectiveness of such agencies in the
   context of resistance to feminist initiatives, democratic backsliding
   and backlash against progress towards gender justice are considered. The
   essay contends that connections and relations of solidarity between
   autonomous and state feminism, across borders, and across class and
   identity-groups in a variety of contexts is important for maintaining
   and/or continuing progress towards gender justice. Some promising new
   directions for future research are identified.},

Abstract = {An essential component of a representative's job centers on deciding
   where to allocate scarce resources. How do legislators attempt to
   allocate spending across the geographic units of their constituencies,
   and what determines a legislator's success in securing these resources?
   To answer these questions, we create a new dataset of all earmark
   requests made by U.S. senators in the 117th Congress. This data was
   recently made available as part of reforms, allowing researchers to
   examine both requests and outcomes. We show that senators prioritize
   seeking earmarks for areas of their constituencies critical to their
   electoral success. We then match these requests to earmarks funded by
   the Appropriations Committee and show that a legislator's institutional
   standing and the behavior of their same-state colleague-but not
   electoral concerns-shape whether projects are successfully funded. We
   provide insight into a behind-the-scenes aspect of representation and
   illuminate the strategic dynamics that shape federal spending.},

Abstract = {Trust in the police in England and Wales has diminished steadily over
   the past decade. Police still enjoy levels of trust that other some
   institutions might envy, so calling this a crisis risks over-statement.
   Yet, declining trust and intense media, political and social pressure on
   police-symbolised by a number of high-profile instances of police
   failure and malpractice-certainly makes many working in and around
   policing feel like it is a crisis. And trust has gone down; action is
   needed to protect the idea of policing by consent, the bedrock ideology
   that underpins British policing. In this article, we review some
   potential solutions to declining trust, while also acknowledging some
   costs and difficulties. We close by noting that, despite its importance,
   public trust is not enough to ensure `good policing', and that more is
   needed in terms of transparency, accountability and governance.},

   interdependence of online and offline, which takes shape in the special
   context of the dominant discourse of traditional Islam and the
   securitization of Islamic activism. The construction of ``right{''} and
   ``wrong{''} Islam determines the special structure of media consumption
   of Russian Muslims and the content of the political agenda. In addition
   to verbalized political agendas, I describe the phenomenon of an
   ``unspoken{''} political agenda hidden beyond religious messages and
   identified precisely only through background by actors transmitting it.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on interactions and cooperation between peoples and
   countries of the Global South which are getting more relevant in the
   contemporary era. It analyses mainly socialist tendencies in the
   South-South cooperation by specifying three issues: a conceptual
   typology of states, and interrelated concepts of independence and
   development. It proceeds in the following sequence of steps. First, it
   explains the typology of states in the Global South, specifically by
   using the global comparative typology of socialist countries in Africa,
   Latin America, and Asia. Second, it identifies the basic kinds of
   periods of the struggle for independence and the struggle for
   development since World War II to specify the cooperation conceptually
   in a chronological way. From perspectives of social and political
   philosophy and global studies, the article contributes to the
   understanding of cooperation in the contemporary multipolar and
   multilateral tendencies in the world.},

   Jack Amariglio's interlocutors to explore the circumstances in which
   their paths have crossed with Jack's and how that encounter has
   influenced them. In this exchange, Bruce Norton recalls Jack Amariglio's
   solidarity work at the graduate school (Department of Economics,

   offers a case for reading Jack Amariglio's writings on Marxism as an
   immanent critique, a postmodern Marxian encounter with modernist Marxian
   economics.},

Abstract = {Jack Amariglio was the founding editor of Rethinking MARXISM (as it was
   then typographically rendered) in 1988. He held the post for nine years,
   followed by many more years on the editorial board. During his nine
   years of editorship, nothing appeared in RM under Jack's name alone. His
   work was deeply embedded in a collective endeavor and can only be
   understood in relation to the others in the collective; at the same
   time, Jack's work was an attractive force that did much to hold the
   collective together. Simultaneously, and for an additional two decades
   beyond his editorship of RM, Jack was a member of the Merrimack College
   faculty. In both of these roles, Jack was an exemplar of a claim from an
   early issue of RM. The editors' introduction in volume 1, number 2,
   invited readers to quote the Herr Keuner stories by Bertolt Brecht,
   newly translated by Lee Baxandall: ``Love,{''} wrote Brecht-as-Keuner,
   ``is the art of producing something with the capabilities of the
   other.{''} This sort of love has been Jack's work.},

Abstract = {Why do politicians publicly attack the leaders of their own party, even
   when they have no opportunistic reasons to do so and such attacks are
   electorally costly? The article addresses this question by presenting a
   model in which the leader faces a preference conflict with dissenting
   members of his party, and voters are learning about their own policy
   preferences over time. Here, by publicly attacking the leader (and
   thereby harming the party in the upcoming election), the dissenters can
   change his incentives to choose more or less extreme policies, which
   affects the amount of voter learning. This induces a trade-off between
   winning the current election and inducing the party leadership to pursue
   the dissenters' all-things-considered more preferred policy. Optimally
   balancing this trade-off sometimes involves public dissent that damages
   the party in the short run. In equilibrium open dissent arises precisely
   because it is electorally costly, in order to induce a policy response
   by the leader.},

Abstract = {Greece experienced near political implosion between 2010 and 2012 with
   large-scale demonstrations, strikes, riots, damage to public and private
   property, and multiple clashes between protestors and the police. This
   paper provides a political economic explanation for unrest in Greece
   based on the labour market and argues that sudden labour market
   deregulation imposed by the `Troika' institutions exposed exceptionally
   immobile labour groups in Greece to a radical degree of uncertainty and
   risks. The strict austerity measures and external conditionality made
   the political authority unable to address those rising grievances. As a
   result, we witnessed severe unrest and instability in the country.
   Putting Greece in comparative perspective with seven other European
   bailout programs during the global financial crisis, the paper shows
   that, as opposed to the existing explanations based on Greek
   exceptionalism, such severe labour immobility combined with abrupt
   labour market deregulation would result in unrest in any country.},

Abstract = {A competitive country has the capacity to increase the productivity of
   its companies and improve the quality of life of its population.
   However, Mexico does not have the same levels of competitiveness in its
   32 states. The Mexican Institute for Competitiveness (IMCO) created an
   index to compare the competitiveness of the country and its states. The
   objective of this work was to identify the asymmetries in
   competitiveness among the states, through the analysis of the State
   Competitiveness Index proposed by IMCO. This index is composed of 10
   sub-indices that consider economic and social variables. A cluster
   analysis was performed in order to group the states according to their
   level of competitiveness. The results showed that, although economic
   variables are important for growth, they are not determinant for
   reducing poverty and improving competitiveness. What distinguishes the
   most competitive states from the least competitive is the government's
   ability to promote and implement public policies that benefit business
   development and also have a social impact.},

Abstract = {Global Catastrophic Risks (GCRs) pose an urgent threat to humanity with
   the potential to impact on a global scale and endanger the continuity of
   civilization. Despite their severity, investment in mitigating these
   risks remains limited due to factors such as competition for resources
   and subjective perceptions of these risks by communities and
   decision-makers. This article examines the crucial role of social
   perception of risk in managing GCRs, noting that communities assess and
   respond to risks subjectively, influenced by cultural, social and
   historical factors. It argues that understanding this subjective
   dimension can improve GCR management and reduce their impact. To this
   end, three case studies are analyzed to illustrate how social perception
   of risk has influenced risk management at a smaller scale, considering
   factors such as international coordination, State policies and expert
   knowledge. Finally, the article explores the benefits of scaling up and
   incorporating this perspective into larger-scale risks, including better
   decision-making, greater community resilience and better identification
   of management measures.},

Abstract = {Conventional invocations of republicanism and populism presuppose their
   absolute incompatibility. However, several recent works question this
   opposition by highlighting important points of continuity in the
   axiological orientations that animate each of these traditions. Under
   what theoretical and normative assumptions does the conjugation of
   republican populism become viable? This paper explores the internal
   diversity contained in both political traditions in order to explore
   their possible convergences. We argue that such an assembly would
   require specific vari-ants of republicanism and populism that
   simultaneously accommodate the constitu-tive antagonism of the social
   and the unifying institutional frameworks for the res publica. This
   double condition is traced in some readings of Machiavelli's
   republi-canism, as well as in populist thought that connects with
   Mouffe's agonist theory and contrasts with Laclau's rupturist and
   anti-institutionalist approach},

Abstract = {Mobile instant messaging is widely used in governing circles today. This
   article considers the implications for political legitimacy, examining
   how far the technology encourages those in authority to act consistently
   with the obligations that come with their roles. It looks at several
   recent political scandals in which officeholders are alleged to have
   transgressed public norms with their use of instant messaging. It goes
   on to argue that the concerns raised are well grounded, as the
   affordances of the technology point to personalized, informal, and
   untransparent modes of rule. As the final section argues, that figures
   in public authority embrace the technology despite the scandals it can
   yield tells us something important about their political priorities, in
   particular their willingness to prize output over procedural legitimacy.},

Abstract = {This article proposes multimodal methodologies as a path to revitalising
   criticality in CTS. It begins by assessing the strengths of existing
   scholarship on ``terrorism{''}, whilst also noting this scholarship's
   overwhelmingly linguistic source materials. It considers shortcomings of
   such a monomodal methodology: including the reproduction of binary
   conceptual codes, which I argue are uniquely highly codified in
   linguistic sources; and an imbalance towards structured logics, rather
   than unstructured affects, in CTS' conception of terrorism discourses.
   The article suggests greater diversity of source materials can resolve
   these shortcomings: deepening our critical project by heightening our
   sensitivity to transformative, non-binary ways of knowing; and
   reorienting our analyses from logical to affectual modes of cognition. I
   demonstrate these possibilities with a review of multimodal materials
   from Northern Ireland's so-called ``peace walls{''} (built by state
   security to contain violence of the ``Troubles{''}). I end with
   reflections on why CTS might have operationalised a predominantly
   textual methodology to date - and, further, with a call for readers to
   integrate multimodality in disseminating our research, as much as
   selecting our source materials.},

Abstract = {This article engages with the restoration of broken resilience in Dutch
   secondary radicalisation prevention programmes. It demonstrates the
   simultaneity of disciplinary techniques and affective governance in case
   management captured through the concept of ``affective discipline{''}.
   Affective discipline consists of four elements: 1) Surveillance and
   affective engagement, 2) a pre-conceived ideal, i.e. a norm of what it
   means to be resilient, 3) measures benefitting compliance and punishing
   non-compliance, and 4) affective discipline also disciplines the
   affective relations of those in the programme, as the aim is to restore
   a sense of belonging and a sense of cultural identity. The article
   positions resilience as affective discipline within a broader turn of
   affective governmentality, focusing on the disciplinary aspects of the
   governance of and through affect.},

   divergent outcomes, we begin by assessing and comparing the performance
   capabilities of these coalitions. We then review the ``classic
   account{''} of their (under)performance, which focuses on the role of
   external support in sustaining coalitions. Finally, we use an organized
   hypocrisy lens to show how external funding only ensures a coalition's
   sustainability if, firstly, political relations between participating
   countries and between them and donors align; and secondly, the
   decoupling between discourse and performance does not become too great.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the works of Alfonso Daniel Manuel Rodr \&
   iacute;guez Castelao (d. 1950) from the lens of art historiography, to
   show how Galician art historical contributions from the beginning of the
   twentieth century connected art and artistic styles from the past with
   identity significations. My discussion is mainly based on the discourse
   analysis of Sempre en Galiza (1944) and As cruces de pedra na Galiza
   (1950), along with mentions to other texts such as Alba de Groria (1948)
   or several essays from Revista N \& oacute;s. The examination of these
   texts is complemented with the study of Castelao's visual production.
   Two main arguments are extracted from Castelao's approach to the history
   of Galician art: the Celtic ethnic foundation of Galicia and the
   establishment of two national styles, Romanesque and Baroque, which are
   seen as intrinsic to this territory.},

   ideologues and the betrayal of the democratic transition},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 13},
Abstract = {Throughout its decades-long history, Hungary's governing party, Fidesz,
   has turned to intellectuals for a sense of political direction. This
   article explores the ideas of Gyula Teller, a sociologist who shaped the
   party's worldview from the mid-1990s until his passing in 2023. Teller
   served as an advisor to Viktor Orban for many years and was responsible
   for the content of his infamous illiberalism speech of 2014. His central
   thesis was that socialist managers and liberal ideologues had united to
   form a ruling class in post-communist Hungary. In his view, that ruling
   class operated a vast political, economic and cultural apparatus, which
   impeded the realization of the nation's democratic and bourgeois
   aspirations. His ideas were not an expression of some kind of shapeless
   populism. They were inspired by new class theory, a tradition of
   sociological analysis which has a long history in Eastern Europe and the
   United States. This article breaks down Teller's core arguments about
   the post-communist elite and situates them within the frame of new class
   theory. Teller's ideas facilitated Fidesz' pivot to the right in the
   mid-90s and justified its authoritarian practices in the years to come.},

Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, parliaments around the world implemented
   virtual arrangements to facilitate participation by legislators who were
   negatively affected. This article explores if the pandemic had a
   differential impact on MP participation in parliamentary proceedings by
   age or gender and whether virtual arrangements have mitigated these
   adverse effects. Using the adoption of hybrid proceedings in the United
   Kingdom House of Commons as its case study, and exploiting the change in
   its form and application during the pandemic period as treatment, this
   article demonstrates that the pandemic has had an especially adverse
   impact on women MPs' participation in parliamentary proceedings and that
   virtual arrangements had a substantive role in mitigating the gendered
   effect of the pandemic when its application was more extensive. These
   results suggest that maintaining virtual arrangements for parliamentary
   proceedings post-pandemic is potentially beneficial for the descriptive
   representation of women.},

Abstract = {This study examines the evolution and impact of terrorist networks in
   the Horn of Africa, primarily focusing on Somalia and the surrounding
   region. Following the 9/11 attacks, the Horn of Africa emerged as a
   critical front in global counter-terrorism efforts due to the presence
   of groups like al-Shabaab and ISIS. This paper explores these groups'
   organizational structures, strategies, and operations, highlighting
   their adaptability, resilience, and the sociopolitical dynamics that
   have enabled them to thrive. It delves into the persistent challenges
   faced by Somalia, including political fragmentation, economic
   deprivation, and the complex interplay of local and international
   actors, such as the United States and Turkiye. The study emphasizes the
   need for a multifaceted approach to counter-terrorism that integrates
   military, political, and diplomatic strategies, addressing the immediate
   security threats and the underlying causes of extremism. By analyzing
   current counter-terrorism efforts and their limitations, this paper
   offers strategic recommendations to achieve long-term stability in the
   region.},

Title = {Seeing the radical right movement parties as activist parties. The case
   of EKRE in Estonia},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {60},

Pages = {38-55},

Abstract = {Researchers often struggle to classify some radical right parties,
   which, on the one hand, act as regular electoral-orientated parties but,
   on the other, are using social movement tactics and are actively engaged
   in protest politics. The recent conceptual innovation by Pe \& ntilde;a
   (Polit Stud Rev 19:637-655, 2021), who coined the term ``activist
   party{''}, helps somewhat to overcome the conceptual and empirical
   confusion. The current analysis builds on Pe \& ntilde;a's framework and
   applies the activist party's conception to the Conservative People's
   Party of Estonia (EKRE), which epitomizes many features of the
   aforementioned party type. However, the paper moves beyond the original
   framework and shows that the radical right parties do not always have
   fluid social movement-like organizational structures, but they may
   develop relatively centralized and well-institutionalized party
   organizations and come to resemble even modern mass parties.
   Nevertheless, those mass-party-like organizations do not disqualify them
   as activist parties; instead, they could further reinforce some of their
   characteristic features. The article also demonstrates that the activist
   party notion could be successfully applied beyond the EKRE's case-a
   review of the existing literature indicates that similar activist
   parties could be found both in Western and Eastern Europe.},

Abstract = {In his article in this journal, Michael Jacobs lists the multiple
   overlapping crises which now affect the world. These include climate
   change and rising economic inequality. This comment endorses his
   emphasis on institutions and his call for richer institutional analyses
   to help develop viable policies to deal with these problems. But, on the
   other hand, this comment criticises his use of the term `neoliberalism'
   to identify a major source of our current difficulties. Many
   `neoliberals' are said to favour market solutions. But the term has
   become so vague that it is linked to not only economists such as Milton
   Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, but also to others who accept some markets
   in a mixed economy. Opposition to `neoliberalism' then involves a
   rejection of market reforms in economies such as China and of mixed
   economies more generally. The word now means so many different things
   that it has becomes unusable.},

Abstract = {Can we increase students' grasp and integration of research methods in
   political science, and do so in a fun way? We believe the answer is yes.
   In this article, we introduce the workshop-based narrative framework
   ``The Tale of Folke Folkesson,{''} where students role-play as the
   methods expert group Linnaeus Opinion Laboratory (LOL). Through an
   interactive engagement with the story, students are exposed to the
   combined utility of various qualitative and quantitative techniques such
   as content analysis, survey research, experiments, and interviews. This
   methodological exercise enables students to recognize not only the
   individual strengths and weaknesses of each method, but also how one
   method can offset the limitations and/or amplify the benefits of
   another. Importantly for student learning, it does so in a fun and
   engaging way. Beyond introducing the narrative framework, we describe
   how educators can adapt the ``Tale of Folke Folkesson{''} to meet their
   specific educational needs.},

Abstract = {How does the state of the German economy influence the performance of
   the German Green Party? Investigating the strong correlation between
   Germany's economic standing and the German Greens' electoral results
   over the past two decades, this article tests the post-material
   contention that throughout the 21st Century, confidence in the economy
   has enabled citizens to more fully consider socio-cultural issues,
   including those key to the Greens' political appeal, translating to
   stronger Green Party performance. Data from Politbarometer support this
   argument, showing that concern for key socio-cultural issues mediates
   and helps explain the relationship between satisfaction with the
   national economy and Green electoral performance over time. However,
   this trend does not hold when considering personal economic
   satisfaction, suggesting there are further considerations which impact
   how economic development influences the Greens' performance.},

Abstract = {This paper explores whether language shapes political culture by
   examining the case of French and a possible transnational francophone
   political culture. Using original survey data from Canada, Belgium,
   Switzerland, and France collected in autumn 2020, we find only small
   within-country differences between francophones and non-francophones and
   limited transnational alignment. National patterns dominate even in
   multilingual federations with divided media landscapes and centrifugal
   politics. Only regarding feminism and drug policy do we find evidence of
   a common francophone orientation. In both domains, French mother tongue
   is correlated with the same distinct attitude regarding the role of the
   state compared to non-French speakers. These findings suggest that
   language is indeed related to political culture, albeit in a
   circumscribed manner. We thus contribute to scholarship on political
   behaviour and multicultural federalism by exploring how language shapes
   attitudes for individuals and groups alike.},

Abstract = {Whereas the literature on colonial legacies has flourished in recent
   years, relatively less attention has been paid to the origins of
   colonial institutions. What explains variation in the design of colonial
   institutions? Some scholars have stressed the importance of precolonial
   factors, arguing that institutions were designed to reflect the
   environmental and socio-political conditions that the colonizers
   encountered in the colonies. Others hold that policymaking reflected the
   colonial powers' metropolitan identity and aims. We believe these
   literature have been insufficiently attentive to the colonial state and
   the political ideals of colonial bureaucrats. Drawing on evidence from
   British India and French Algeria, we show that land policy was shaped by
   intense competition between ideologically motivated officials, who
   disagreed over the uses and aims of state power. Theorizing the role of
   ideas allows us to explain variation in colonial policies across both
   space and time while highlighting the indispensability of qualitative
   methods of analysis.},

Abstract = {Despite growing interest in how parties use social group appeals to
   reach out to different groups within society, the combination of policy
   issues and social groups in parties' campaign strategies remains poorly
   understood. Building on existing theories of issue competition, this
   study develops and tests new hypotheses about the relationship between
   policy appeals and group appeals. It proposes that the use of group
   appeals in policy communication depends on parties' perceived issue
   competence and the public salience of the issue. It is hypothesised that
   parties frequently employ appeals to social groups to improve the
   communication about their owned issues and about issues that are
   important to voters. However, if their best issues lack public salience,
   parties will link them with appeals to related groups to increase their
   relevance. Conversely, when parties lack competence for salient issues,
   they will try to reframe these weaker issues using appeals to unrelated
   groups. These expectations are tested by combining new data on issue
   emphasis and social group appeals from election manifestos (1990-2019)
   with public opinion data on public issue salience and perceived party
   competence in Austria. The results confirm that group appeals in party
   communication about policy issues are shaped by issue salience and
   competence perceptions. These findings have key implications for our
   understanding of issue competition and voter representation.},

Abstract = {What factors account for polarization in constitutional conventions
   comprised of party members and many independents without prior
   legislative experience? Using the 4,669 roll call votes in the
   155-member constitutional convention in Chile (2021-2), comprised of
   more independents than party members, we explore the determinants of
   ideological polarization. Relying on absolute values for the WNominate
   scores, we find that party members are less polarized than independents
   and that prior legislative experience does not impact polarization. In
   institutionalized party systems that allow independents to compete with
   party members on a level playing field, a larger presence of
   independents in legislatures might help increase ideological
   polarization while a larger number of party members helps reduce
   ideological polarization in roll call votes.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the transfer of political patterns between the West
   and Japan from a << what if history >> or counterfactual perspective. In
   the first paragraph, the influence of German scholars on Japan is framed
   from the perspective of expectations of what Japanese visitors wanted to
   hear. In the second part of the article, mainly based on literature in
   the original language and on primary and secondary sources on the
   politi-cal debate of the Meiji era (1868-1912), the ways in which the
   Western political ideas and concepts have transited into modern Japan,
   were translated and assimilated are explored. Finally, we will show how
   the << what if history >> is not only a distorting but also a corrective
   lens with respect to the << fallacy of retrospective determinism},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to contribute to one of the central discussions
   of the affective turn, the distinction between affect and emotion,
   especially regarding its relationship to language. To do so, it
   addresses some questions concerning the complex but crucial relationship
   between language and negative feelings, focusing on the problem of
   depression. We need words for pain, but words can also deepen it. There
   are words for pain, there are indeed too many, often in competition with
   each other: thus, it certainly matters which words we use to name our
   pain. Drawing on feminist philosophical traditions and the
   interdisciplinary field of translation studies, I will explore some
   philosophical and political discussions on the plurality of languages
   when it comes to naming, understanding, and experiencing negative
   feelings, and its implications for the distinction between affect and
   emotion.},

Abstract = {Climate disasters raise the salience of climate change's negative
   consequences, including climate-induced migration. Policy action to
   address climate displacement is especially contentious in the United
   States, where weak support for tackling climate change intersects with
   high opposition to migration. Do climate disasters foster receptivity
   toward climate migrants and broader willingness to combat climate
   change? To study this question, we leverage the occurrence of Hurricane
   Ian during fielding of a preregistered survey in autumn 2022. Hurricane
   exposure increased concern about and support for policies to address
   climate migration. Hurricane exposure also increased support for climate
   action and belief in anthropogenic climate change. Effects of hurricane
   exposure cross-cut partisanship, education, age, and other important
   correlates of climate attitudes but decay within 6 months. Together,
   these results suggest that climate disasters may briefly increase
   favorability toward climate migrants and climate policy action but are
   unlikely to durably mobilize support even in severely impacted areas.},

Abstract = {Although in recent years populism has emerged from within mainstream
   conservative parties around the world, populism and conservatism are
   still rarely studied together. Trying to establish a link between the
   two may appear paradoxical, given their opposing ideational content, as
   populism mobilizes the people against the elites, while conservatism
   defends established hierarchies and traditions. This article argues
   however that we can identify many more similarities and overlaps between
   populism and conservatism if we adopt a broader conceptualization of
   political ideologies that includes not only their ideational content but
   also their discursive, strategic, organizational and structural
   dimensions. On this basis, the article views populism and conservatism
   as modes of politics that mobilize followers primarily on the basis of
   idealized visions of the political community and state-society
   relations. Although populism puts forth an antagonistic vision of these
   relations and conservatism a deferential one, both are otherwise quite
   similar to strategies aimed at defining the boundaries and character of
   the political community on the basis of its relationship with political
   authority. The article conducts an empirical probe demonstrating how its
   theoretical argument can be applied in comparative research.},

Abstract = {Theories of populism have been troubled by the problem of essentially
   contested definitions of its basic properties. It is difficult to
   distinguish populism from conventional political behavior. This produces
   the problem of `degreeism', while other features of populism are
   expressed in relationships rather than as specific categories of
   attitudes and behaviors. These problems cannot be eliminated by
   redefining or excluding aspects of populism in favor of a more
   restrictive definition. We argue that, given that conceptual
   indeterminacy is inherent in populism, it is better conceptualized as a
   relational concept. The article articulates a new, relational conception
   of populist ideology, discourse/rhetoric, and leadership style in terms
   of relative distance from an implicit `center ground'. Populism is
   marked by position-taking of distance away from the center in policy
   (distal), a wide distance between people and elites and/or outsiders
   (distal), and close distance between leaders and followers (proximal). A
   general, relational model of populism is deduced in this form: distal -
   distal - proximal. Far from being an abstract claim, we illustrate how
   the relative distance framework offers descriptive and analytical tools
   for social scientists focused on populism.},

   and the UK},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 26},
Abstract = {Data-driven campaigning is often depicted as the latest iteration of
   modern campaign practice. This term captures the idea that political
   parties now routinely gather data from online and offline sources to
   inform decision making in regard to a range of campaign actions. Within
   existing scholarship, however, comparative studies of campaign practice
   are lacking, meaning that we lack an understanding of how and why
   data-driven campaigns vary across different contexts. In this paper we
   offer an in-depth analysis of data-driven campaigning in two European
   countries; Austria and the UK. Using elite interviews with party
   officials and campaigners in nine parties, we conduct a qualitative
   thematic analysis to explore data-driven campaigning practices and
   perceptions. Through this research, we highlight hitherto unappreciated
   cross-national variations in data-driven campaigning and suggest that
   differences can be attributed to structural and agential factors.},

Abstract = {France is the only European Union Member State which did not meet its
   objective of 23\% renewable energy in final consumption in 2020. Among
   the reasons cited by public authorities and developers is litigation,
   presented as one of the main hurdles to renewable energy development.
   Indeed, authorizations for wind power projects are almost systematically
   contested in the courts. But developers also have the chance to defend
   their projects there. Yet there is a lack of statistics and the reality
   of this obstacle needs to be verified. On the basis of a study of the
   French Council of State's decisions on wind power projects, this paper
   aims to provide an analysis of the current case law. It highlights who
   the litigants are and what their arguments are. In-depth comparison of
   decisions shows how judges assess specific contexts in light of national
   rules. Some profound tensions that run through the European
   climate-energy multilevel governance framework thus become apparent.},

Abstract = {Using the Round 9 Afrobarometer survey data for Niger, this study
   examined the determinants of support for military intervention with
   particular focus on political instability, perceived corruption in the
   democratic government, and socioeconomic deprivation. The descriptive
   results showed that Nigeriens generally do not have a strong aversion
   towards military rule. In fact, about 70 percent of them agreed that the
   military should intervene when the democratic government is corrupt. The
   regression results showed that political instability, which was measured
   using the total number of violent conflict incidents in the region where
   respondents resided, was positively correlated with support for military
   intervention. This might be because people who are exposed to violence
   feel that a military government would do a better job at providing
   security. Perceived corruption in government was also positively
   correlated with support for military intervention. This might be because
   corruption engenders discontent with democratic institutions, prompting
   people to see military intervention as a way of curtailing the
   democratic government's excesses. Socioeconomic deprivation was
   negatively correlated with support for military intervention, which
   suggests that the poor prefer democracy to a military government.},

Abstract = {From 1965 to 2020, the National Science Foundation constituted the
   single largest funding source for political science research. As such,
   the NSF played a central role in defining the cutting-edge of our
   discipline. This study draws on historical records of the American
   Political Science Association to examine the political and
   administrative contexts that shaped the funding priorities of the NSF
   Political Science Program. Additionally, the study presents a new
   dataset and analysis of the nearly three thousand projects funded over
   the 55-year life of the program. The dataset shows that NSF funding was
   principally channeled toward quantitative research, whereas qualitative
   methods received little support, and work advancing normative, critical,
   or interpretive approaches received virtually no support. The archival
   record and awards-level data make visible the material forces that
   shaped knowledge production, and they underline the NSF's instrumental
   role in consolidating behavioralism and marginalizing non-positivist
   approaches. The study sheds new light on the history of the discipline
   and helps to contextualize some of the distinctive features of American
   political science.},

Abstract = {Since the establishment of the Journal of Political Science Education
   (JPSE) in 2004, the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning has become more
   rigorous and data-based, thanks in large part to the efforts of editors,
   peer-reviewers, and submitters to the journal. Where does the field go
   from here? I argue that our greatest strengths lie in multimethod
   approaches. To best understand how to improve teaching and learning in
   political science, we need to use all of our methodological tools. To
   illustrate these tools, I provide examples of some of the most-cited
   pieces in JPSE over the past 20 years, including ones using large-n
   statistical, experimental, case study, student self-report, qualitative
   evaluation, and reflective methodologies. I also provide examples of
   multimethod SoTL work and argue that the best way to move the field
   forward is to use multiple methodological tools together. Multimethod
   approaches help us better understand both the teaching problems that are
   facing the field of political science today and how best to respond to
   them. For instance, big data can help us understand overall trends, but
   may hide the individual experiences of students; experiments may reveal
   causal relationships, but surveys can help us understand how they
   function in practice. By bringing multiple methodological approaches
   together, we can get better answers to important questions. The
   widespread adoption of multimethod SoTL approaches in the future will
   require rethinking graduate school training, thoughtful research design,
   and providing intentional collaboration opportunities through
   conferences and infrastructure.},

Abstract = {We revisit Arunachalam and Watson's contention that a person's physical
   height may be used as instrument for income because it affects economic
   well-being solely by causing more conservative political preferences
   among people who are taller. To evaluate whether other early-life and
   genetic factors might serve as mechanisms connecting height and
   political preferences, we analyze a unique data source that includes
   political, economic, and demographic data on same-gender siblings.
   Models that include fixed effects for siblings provide a strong test of
   the Arunachalam and Watson thesis. We find that height is not a
   consistent predictor of political preferences once shared sibling
   characteristics are controlled in this way, raising doubt about whether
   height can in fact be used as an instrument for income.},

Abstract = {On 1 April 1923, a `temporary frontier' on imported goods was placed on
   the boundary line between Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State.
   This temporary frontier lasted for over 70 years, only being rescinded
   due to the introduction of the Single Market throughout the European
   Union in 1993. It was the Irish Free State government that introduced
   the measure that in essence created a hard land border on the island,
   and not the Northern Ireland government, with its prime minister Sir
   James Craig claiming that `Those in the South who proposed to erect that
   barrier wall, and not the North, would be responsible for partition.
   There was no such thing as partition if they had not a Customs barrier
   between the North and the South' (Irish Times, 10 March 1923). Despite
   the Free State government's public utterances opposing partition, its
   decision to erect customs barriers helped to cement partition. This
   article looks at why the fledgling Irish Free State government chose to
   erect customs barriers, why the Northern Ireland government opposed the
   move, and how it drove a further wedge between both jurisdictions,
   politically, economically and socially.},

Title = {Right up their street? News media framing of the protest activities of
   far-right movement parties},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},

Volume = {60},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {76-97},

Abstract = {Far-right parties have increasingly emphasised their movement-like
   characteristics as a novel mobilisation strategy. Existing studies of
   these so-called `far-right movement parties' have concentrated on their
   internal organisation and communications to understand how they mediate
   between a movement and party identity through their own actions. Yet
   research is lacking on how this identity is constructed and presented by
   the news media: a crucial interface between institutional politics and
   public opinion. This paper pursues this enquiry with a comparative
   analysis of the newspaper coverage of two prominent cases-the German AfD
   and UKIP-and asks how coverage of their increasing involvement in
   protests has varied cross-nationally and evolved over time. The analysis
   reveals the relative salience of the protest activities of the
   far-right, along with the associated social movement actors, issues and
   frames used in the reporting. It shows that far-right party protest
   receives a low level of attention and tends to be accompanied by
   delegitimising framing, particularly when associated (extremist)
   movements are also present. In both cases analysed, a critical juncture
   generated increasing attention to far-right party protest, but also more
   delegitimising frames. The study provides new insights into the
   structures and processes which influence how the media has responded to
   the new far-right `movement party' form in Europe, with implications for
   our understanding of contemporary far-right mobilisation strategies.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the 2017 Kamour sit-in as an example of lived
   citizenship. Composed of young men from the marginalized south of
   Tunisia, the Kamour sit-inners mobilized in pursuit of employment,
   regional development, transparency within the oil and gas sector and a
   life of dignity. To draw attention to their cause, the sit-inners
   disrupted the region's hydrocarbon infrastructure through a series of
   roadblocks and sit-ins, culminating in turning off the pumping valve at
   the remote Kamour oil pumping facility. Throughout, the sit-inners
   framed their demands and actions in relation to Tunisian citizenship.
   The paper explores how a citizen subjectivity was constructed in
   conjuncture with the experience of living and protesting in Tunisia's
   marginalized south. Drawing on Jacques Ranciere's notion of
   subjectivization, and the attendant concept of disidentification, I
   argue for the Kamour sit-in as a site where sit-inners creatively
   disordered the content and meaning of Tunisian citizenship, reimagining
   a citizen subjectivity grounded in the lived experience of Tunisia's
   south.},

Abstract = {Surveys show that U.S. voters detest Congressional gridlock and desire
   greater legislative productivity. However, incumbents are rarely voted
   out. I argue that this lack of electoral accountability is driven in
   part by an information lacuna as to what extent individual
   representatives are working to move legislation forward. Through a
   series of survey experiments, I find that respondents reduce support for
   representatives when given information directly highlighting their lack
   of effectiveness in moving bills through the legislative process. They
   also reduce support for legislators less willing to engage in bipartisan
   lawmaking. These finding hold regardless of the strength of one's
   partisan attachment as well as whether the legislator is a member of the
   inparty or outparty. I also find that respondents reward members of
   Congress that have a demonstrated record of effective and bipartisan
   lawmaking, albeit to a lesser degree. The results suggest that if media,
   interest groups, or other institutions provide more information
   concerning individual representatives' role in the legislative process,
   the electorate can hold them accountable for their productivity.},

Abstract = {While existing studies have addressed the importance of political
   profile for media visibility, far fewer works have examined how speaking
   in parliament is associated with media attention-an important mechanism
   in reaching out to voters. This paper tests how the amount and
   particularly the style of parliamentary speech are related to media
   attention. We employ a unique data set that covers all parliamentary
   transcripts for the 2011-2015 and 2015-2019 parliamentary terms in
   Estonia and online media content from that period (similar to 2.7
   million news articles). We assume that MPs can use parliamentary speech
   as a tool to foster personal attention. First, the results show that MPs
   who speak in parliament receive more media attention than those who do
   not, and speaking more means more media visibility. Second, the media
   pays more attention to rank-and-file MPs who use more negative, complex
   language and more singular and plural first-person pronouns.},

Abstract = {The relationship between neoliberalism and democracy has been a topic of
   debate among scholars for decades. Neoliberalism, an economic and
   political ideology that emphasizes free markets, deregulation, and
   privatization, has gained global influence but has also been criticized
   for undermining democratic institutions. This article offers a critical
   perspective on the emergence of authoritarian neoliberalism and its
   impact on democratic governance in the 21st century. By examining the
   concentration of wealth and power, the erosion of public trust, and the
   privatization of essential services, this study sheds light on the
   challenges posed by neoliberalism and the need for policies that
   rebalance economic and political power.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship claims that group grievances due to political
   exclusion and discrimination drive civil wars. The grievance perspective
   suggests that socio-psychological factors allow groups to overcome
   collective action problems. We argue that the grievance perspective
   (over)focuses on the ends and not means, which are critical to explain
   how groups survive state sanction, allowing contention to escalate to
   civil war. We suggest that inclusive economic governance reduces
   investment in state-evading infrastructures for quotidian economic
   reasons, leading to the buildup of rebellion-specific capital. Physical
   and human infrastructures of state evasion form the logistical bases for
   survival against state sanction. Our analyses show that
   group-grievance-generating political factors are poorer predictors of
   civil war compared with economic freedoms measured as free-market
   friendly policies and the private ownership of economies, which should
   reduce economic rents accruing to state-evading shadow markets. Our
   results are robust to several alternative models, data, and estimating
   method. Theory that ignores the means explain the main causes of costly
   violence only partially, or mistake symptom for cause. Freedom and
   inclusiveness, which should reduce grievances, are intrinsically
   valuable, but they are hard to obtain when violence is waged
   successfully for more narrower ends.},

Title = {Strategically Hijacking Victimhood: A Political Communication Strategy
   in the Discourse of Viktor Orbán and Donald Trump},

Abstract = {This article introduces the concept of ``hijacked victimhood{''} as a
   form of strategically leveraging victimhood narratives. It is a subset
   of strategic victimhood, which is a relatively common communicative
   strategy whereby groups claim victimhood status in contests over power
   and legitimacy. Political leaders who use the strategy of hijacked
   victimhood present dominant groups as in danger, as current or future
   victims, and in need of protection (especially by the crafter of the
   narrative) from oppressive forces consisting of-or indirectly
   representing-marginalized and subaltern groups. In the process, leaders
   hijacking victimhood blunt the rights-based claims of such groups.
   Analyzing Viktor Orban's and Donald Trump's elite rhetoric in Hungary
   and the United States, respectively, we inductively document varieties
   of hijacked victimhood in their political communication, showing how
   Orban leverages historical suffering and resistance while Trump
   constructs economic and value-based harms for dominant groups. Making
   both conceptual and empirical contributions, we argue that at the heart
   of hijacked victimhood is a reversal of the victimizer-victim dichotomy,
   a new portrayal of moral orders, a teleological ordering of past and
   future harms, and a mobilization of security threats-all used to
   preserve or expand a dominant group's power.},

Abstract = {The society in which the police operate is changing radically, meaning
   that we need to rethink our policing and wider public safety
   institutions. Policing needs to be clearer as to its purpose, and needs
   to work in a much more collaborative way with other public services,
   particularly to do more to prevent crime and harm. Policing needs new or
   reformed capabilities in areas such as legitimacy, technology and
   skills. And finally, policing needs a better organisational platform if
   it is to play its role in keeping people safe in the transformed
   conditions of the twenty-first century.},

Title = {Supersession and compensation for historical injustice},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 18},
Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between Jeremy Waldron's
   supersession thesis and compensation. Recently, Waldron has argued that
   claims for material compensation for the original injustice cannot be
   superseded. He limits supersession to issues of restitution. Waldron's
   supersession thesis is frequently cited by opponents of claims based on
   historical injustice, so his view of compensation warrants close
   examination. In our article, we explain the details of Waldron's `simple
   model' of compensation, offer an internal critique of it, and try to
   sympathetically reconstruct it. We contend that a crucial claim about
   this model does not work; his model would result in many more
   backward-looking compensatory claims than he realizes. Waldron's
   allowing for material compensation claims from historical injustice is
   in tension with, or incompatible with, his long-expressed view that the
   spirit of the supersession thesis is that justice should be
   forward-looking and look to present-day costs. We have argued elsewhere
   that the abstract possibility that restitution claims may be superseded
   due to changing circumstances (what we call the `supersession thesis
   proper') is separable from the question of whether justice has a
   forward-looking or backward-looking orientation. We argue here that
   Waldron's model of compensation can best be made sense of through our
   distinction of `full supersession' and `partial supersession.' This
   allows us to show that Waldron's model relies on a more strongly
   backward-looking orientation than he seems to endorse in his earlier
   works on restitution and his most recent article discussing
   compensation. We conclude by offering external criticisms of Waldron's
   model of compensation.},

Abstract = {Despite the growing interest for lobbying in public opinion research,
   little is known about citizen's attitudes towards interest groups,
   especially after legislation making lobbying transparent is passed.
   Using data from a pre-registered survey experiment conducted with a
   panel of 569 participants from the Republic of Ireland, this study shows
   that when exposed to information about lobbying conducted by
   Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and business organisations,
   citizens do not improve their evaluations of interest groups.
   Surprisingly, against the general expectations found in the transparency
   literature, information about lobbying does not trigger positive changes
   in attitudes. A post hoc analysis of the participants' reactions to the
   transparency treatment reveals that citizens may have little interest or
   understanding of political activities such as lobbying. The study,
   however, also reveals that lobbying transparency does not backfire
   producing unexpected negative effects. This adds a new perspective to
   the recent debate on how public opinion responds to interest group
   behaviour.},

Abstract = {This study tackles several important unanswered questions about gender,
   family status, and parliamentary representation. We use the case of the
   German Bundestag to explore gender gaps in family status among elected
   politicians and subsequently to ask whether and how parenthood affects
   MPs' advancement in their political careers. Using an original dataset
   of biographical details for German MPs from 1994 to 2017, we find gender
   gaps in both marital and parental status among parliamentarians, with
   men being more likely to report being parents than women, and women
   being more likely to specify that they have no children. We also find
   variation across German political parties. Most importantly, we show
   that parenthood reduces the likelihood of serving multiple terms and
   that this parenthood penalty is greater for women.},

Abstract = {The 1980s proved critical not merely for contemporary Afghan history but
   also for the women's struggle in Afghanistan. Showcasing Afghan women's
   struggles, this article argues that the 1980s proved crucial in shaping
   feminist debates in Afghanistan. Arguably, Afghan women's lived
   experience from the 1980s drove home the conclusion that foreign
   occupation does not bring women freedoms, while religious tapestries to
   sugarcoat secular women's demands reinforce patriarchy. They learnt in
   the 1980s that their struggles antecede and should succeed foreign
   interventions. It was, therefore, understandable that the first
   demonstration against the Taliban, when they re-entered Kabul in August
   2021, was held by women.},

Abstract = {Higher education has massively expanded around the world, yet we know
   little about the political consequences of this expansion. Students
   generally have overly optimistic expectations about the returns to
   educational investment, and the effects of unmet expectations on
   graduates' political behavior have been overlooked. I study this
   phenomenon in Chile with observational and experimental methods, using
   unique panel survey data collected from new graduates covering 72\% of
   higher education enrollment. The survey tracks students before and after
   they enter the labor market and includes an experiment that induces
   variation in their expectations. The panel data reveals that 65\% of
   students have unmet expectations, and both methods indicate that this
   induces a shift toward progovernment/proequality ideology. Overall, this
   study shows that the gap between aspirations and reality upon graduation
   can be an important driver of political attitudes.},

Abstract = {Faced with the risk of submersion and erosion along their coastlines,
   both France and the Netherlands have long relied on the introduction of
   `hard' protection measures to tackle sea level rise. However, this
   approach has gradually begun to be reconsidered due to the adverse
   side-effects and decreased effectiveness that such protection measures
   may have in light of the increasingly significant impact of climate
   change on shorelines. New policy instruments such as nature-based
   solutions (NBSs) need to be found, but a lack of funding, resistance
   from local actors, and high population densities often impede the
   implementation of these instruments. While path-dependent solutions tend
   to be favoured in the short-term, more radical solutions such as managed
   retreat could prove necessary in the long run.
   Angesichts des Risikos von uberflutungen und Erosion an ihren
   Kustenlinien haben sowohl Frankreich als auch die Niederlande lange auf
   ,,harte{''} Schutzmassnahmen gesetzt, um dem Meeresspiegelanstieg zu
   begegnen. Dieser Ansatz wird allmahlich uberdacht und naturlichen
   Klimaschutzlosungen (Nature-based solutions, NBS) mehr Beachtung
   geschenkt. Die Anpassung an den Klimawandel in Kustengebieten erfordert
   indessen einen Multi-Level Governance-Ansatz, da lokale Akteure allein
   nicht in der Lage sind, die sich stellenden rechtlichen, finanziellen
   und okologischen Probleme zu bewaltigen. Dieser Aufsatz bietet eine
   vergleichende Perspektive auf die Erneuerung des Ansatzes zur Anpassung
   an uberflutungs- und Erosionsrisiken in Kustengebieten in den
   Niederlanden und in Frankreich und hebt die damit verbundenen
   Governance-Herausforderungen hervor. Wahrend beide Lander zu einer
   adaptiven Strategie ubergegangen sind argumentiert dieser Aufsatz, dass
   die jeweiligen Initiativen eine Reihe von Fragen offenlassen und dass,
   was die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels auf die Kustenlinien betrifft,
   nach wie vor eine Form von Verleugnung fortbesteht.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to accomplish two things. First, I update the Index
   of Presidential Leverage (IPL) published in Presidential Leverage
   (Ponder 2018), which analyzed presidential action from Kennedy to the
   end of Obama's first term. This article brings the analysis through the
   end of the Trump administration and replicates the book's analysis of
   executive orders to determine if that measure still exhibits explanatory
   capacity. Second, I consider two alternative measures of presidential
   leverage that tap the same idea of the IPL, which is presidential
   approval in an institutional context (namely, public approval of
   Congress and public trust in Congress). The article employs these
   alternative measures in a preliminary attempt to determine the efficacy
   of the concept of presidential leverage across different measures. I
   find that the concept of presidential leverage operationalized in these
   various ways is not only robust, but as was the case in the original
   analysis, outperforms analyses using raw presidential approval in
   isolation. Thus, the concept of presidential leverage is shown to be
   applicable across various measurement strategies. The robustness of the
   presidential leverage measure is important because it undergirds the
   idea that presidential approval in context, rather than simply as a
   stand-alone indicator, provides nuance and explanatory power to the
   study of presidential action that may be missed otherwise.},

Title = {The Role of Preference Formation and Perception in Unequal
   Representation. Combined Evidence From Elite Interviews and Focus Groups
   in Germany},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {431-461},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Unequal representation can result from politicians' biased perception of
   public opinion. Existing research has focused on the numerical accuracy
   with which politicians estimate preferences distributions in surveys.
   This method ignores politicians' broader assumptions about public
   preferences; e.g. regarding their crystallization, salience,
   malleability, and measurability in surveys. We address these assumptions
   in a novel two-stage research design using redistributive tax policy in
   Germany as a case. Interviews with parliamentarians show that voters are
   perceived as uninformed, disinterested, and susceptible to anti-tax
   mobilization by business representatives. Support for taxing the rich in
   polls is dismissed as superficial and irrelevant for political behavior.
   In a second step, we verify these assumptions in twelve focus groups
   with high- or low-educated citizens. They largely confirm the assumed
   indifference and anti-tax attitudes. An education gap in tax preferences
   cannot be identified. Support expressed in previous surveys tends to
   disappear in conversations, which aligns with politicians' experiences.},

Abstract = {June 2024 marked 30 years since the first meeting of what is now known
   as the Federation Chamber-that is, the second chamber of the Australian
   House of Representatives. While it does not have the same profile as the
   House, the Federation Chamber now meets almost every day that the House
   sits and is the forum for members to make a variety of contributions,
   from constituency statements to considering bills in detail. As the role
   of the Federation Chamber has evolved, it has come to contribute to a
   wider range of the work of the House. The article traces the evolution
   of the second chamber of the House of Representatives over the last 30
   years and considers how it has grown to support the House in its
   legislative, scrutiny, budget- setting, representative and grievance
   functions.},

Abstract = {For the executive to spend money, the Parliament must legislate an
   appropriation from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. To ensure
   accountability, the Senate has established the Budget Estimates process
   to examine and conduct public parliamentary scrutiny over executive
   expenditure in the annual appropriation bills. However, this amounts to
   approximately just one quarter of authorised expenditure- the other
   three quarters is authorised in various `standing' appropriations with
   no dedicated ongoing review mechanism. This article considers what
   standing appropriations are and the challenge they pose to responsible
   government, and what mechanisms currently exist to provide government
   accountability and parliamentary oversight within the Australian Senate
   as the house of review. It concludes by offering some recommendations
   for the Senate to improve parliamentary oversight in order to ensure
   that standing appropriations remain fit for purpose and the executive
   are held accountable for spending authorised under them. Specifically,
   this article recommends that the Senate: request more information be
   provided in ministers' second reading speeches and explanatory memoranda
   accompanying bills that establish standing appropriations, to assist in
   their scrutiny; include sunset clauses and provisions requiring review
   in new standing appropriations to ensure regular oversight and scrutiny
   over standing appropriations once enacted; and publish online a running
   list of standing appropriations with additional information to improve
   transparency and aid in understanding the context within which the
   Parliament can consider proposed standing appropriations.},

Abstract = {The confrontation between China and the United States in the
   international economic and trade field has been gradually evolving into
   a much wider one between China and the Western world at large. In the
   escalating technological confrontation between China and the United
   States, Beijing has chosen export controls on gallium and germanium as a
   means of retaliation against U.S. export controls on advanced chips to
   China. However, whether it is oil, gas, gallium, germanium, or rare
   earths, export controls on these natural resources can only have a
   visible effect in the short term and may not achieve the political
   objectives intended by the sanctioners. With continued advances in
   resource extraction technology, the ongoing exploration of alternative
   resources, and the increasingly important role played by the price
   adjustment mechanisms, the export control on natural resources may not
   produce a sanctionary effect of stranglehold in the long run. After the
   Group of Seven (G-7) Hiroshima Summit, the confrontation landscape
   between China and the West has been further established, and the
   geopolitics in the world has entered a new era in which global economic
   growth faces greater uncertainty. Only multilateralism and global
   cooperation can promote the long-term prosperity of the world economy.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the role of local authorities in Myanmar following a
   military coup in February 2021 which has generated a nation-wide
   resistance and put local state authorities in a difficult situation as
   mediators between the junta authorities, resistance movements, and local
   populations. Based on surveys of 26 community researchers, interviews of
   51 residents in three most violent areas in Myanmar, and secondary
   sources published by state and non-state media, we find that local state
   administrators have adopted different responses and strategies depending
   on the types of authorities in control of a territory, and the level of
   local resistance to the military junta; the nature and scale of their
   loyalty to the military's regime; their relationship with the local
   residents; and the evolving political situation. These varying responses
   have in turn shaped whether they are perceived as ``agents of the
   state,{''} or ``agents of the revolution{''} by local populations and
   the resistance movement. The Myanmar case offers an insight on how the
   same type of actor (local administrators who are part of the state
   administrative machinery) can adopt two identities: agents of the state
   facilitating autocratization, or agents of the revolution resisting
   autocratization.},

Abstract = {This article considers the media representation of two women who left
   the west for Islamic State (IS) in the mid-2010s: from France, Christine
   Riviere, nicknamed ``Mamie Djihad{''} (Granny Jihad); and from Britain,
   Sally Jones, known as ``The White Widow{''}. Both were white,
   middle-aged mothers, born and raised in their respective countries, who
   converted late in life and left behind established lives and (adult)
   children to join IS. While much has been written on the migration of
   western women to IS territory, scholarship has focused on younger women
   and girls who have been represented as groomed and vulnerable to IS
   propaganda. These two ``unlikely jihadists{''} profoundly unsettled
   commonsense ideas about who was vulnerable to radicalisation, and, more
   troublingly, their defections could potentially be read as statements on
   the desirability of life in the west vis-a-vis IS's model. Using
   Critical Discourse Analysis of leading French and British news media,
   the article demonstrates how journalists represented both women as
   always-already outside their respective nations through two key
   narratives: a gendered discourse of abject motherhood and an
   intersectional discourse that constructed them as abject inside Others.
   These narratives worked to suture the ideological rupture caused by
   these women, who were at first glance typically French/British, by
   demonstrating that they had actually always been on the margins of the
   national community and had always been dangerous to the nation.},

Abstract = {How close does a nation come to the brink of war with an opponent during
   the process of crisis bargaining? The present study constructs a new
   formal model focused on a challenger's incentive to intensify military
   provocations against a defender that involve a trade-off between
   securing a more profitable bargaining outcome and increasing the risk of
   accidental war. This model identifies the conditions under which the
   defender's threat of military coercion effectively deters the challenger
   from engaging in his payoff-maximizing level of provocations. The
   numerical simulations suggest that a military buildup by a nation can
   cause counterintuitive results, namely, the armament dilemma, depending
   on the balance of the marginal benefits and costs for participants and
   the effectiveness of deterrence. Meanwhile, a state's military buildup
   always strengthens its own bargaining power relative to its opponent's
   regardless of the occurrence of this dilemma; that is, the paradox of
   power does not arise.},

Abstract = {How does justice affect individual incentives and efficiency in a
   political economy? We show that elementary principles of distributive
   justice guarantee the existence of a self-enforcing contract whereby
   agents non-cooperatively choose their inputs and derive utility from
   their pay. Chief among these principles is that your pay should not
   depend on your name, and a more productive individual should not earn
   less. We generalize our analysis to incorporate inclusivity, ensuring
   basic pay to unproductive agents, implemented through progressive
   taxation and redistribution. Our findings show that without
   redistribution, any self-enforcing agreement may be inefficient, but a
   minimal level of redistribution guarantees the existence of an efficient
   agreement. Our model has several applications and interpretations. In
   addition to highlighting the structure of economies and organizations in
   which fairness and efficiency are compatible, we develop an application
   to the formation of rent-seeking political alliances under the threat of
   fake news.},

Abstract = {This study addresses the phenomenon of misinformation about
   misinformation, or politicians ``crying wolf{''} over fake news.
   Strategic and false claims that stories are fake news or deepfakes may
   benefit politicians by helping them maintain support after a scandal. We
   posit that this benefit, known as the ``liar's dividend,{''} may be
   achieved through two politician strategies: by invoking informational
   uncertainty or by encouraging oppositional rallying of core supporters.
   We administer five survey experiments to over 15,000 American adults
   detailing hypothetical politician responses to stories describing real
   politician scandals. We find that claims of misinformation representing
   both strategies raise politician support across partisan subgroups.
   These strategies are effective against text-based reports of scandals,
   but are largely ineffective against video evidence and do not reduce
   general trust in media. Finally, these false claims produce greater
   dividends for politicians than alternative responses to scandal, such as
   remaining silent or apologizing.},

Title = {Revolutionary Confucianism? Neo-Confucian Idealism and Modern Chinese
   Revolutionary Thought},

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between materialism and
   philosophical idealism in the political philosophy of Marxist
   revolutionary movements, by illuminating the influence of Neo-Confucian
   idealism on the sinification of Marxism. Although they had virtually no
   access to the writings of the young Marx, Li Dazhao and Mao Zedong
   incorporated idealist philosophical ideas into their sinified Marxism. I
   argue that three elements of Neo-Confucian idealism contributed to the
   sinification of Marxism that emerged by the 1940s: (1) acknowledgment of
   the real existence of the material world as apprehended by the
   mind-and-heart in Zhu Xi's Neo-Confucianism; (2) emphasis on human will
   and consciousness, drawn from Wang Yangming's Neo-Confucianism; and (3)
   recognition of an autonomous, even decisive role of consciousness and
   culture in revolutionary change. The resulting sinified Marxism
   constituted a revolutionary New Confucianism, highlighting the most
   universal, humanistic, liberative elements in the Chinese philosophical
   tradition. These community-affirming and spiritually rich elements can
   be mobilized against authoritarian forces to support the continuing
   struggle for human rights and democratization within and well beyond
   China today.},

Abstract = {Building on research on cultural threat-induced polarization, we
   investigate the effect of the individual-level salience of cultural
   threats on polarization between social liberals and conservatives. In a
   unique survey experiment conducted with 129,000 respondents nested in
   208 regions in 27 European Union (EU) member states, we manipulate the
   presence of two cultural threats, women's rights, and refugee
   immigration, to test their polarizing effects on social liberals' and
   social conservatives' support for traditional values. We find that
   priming the threat of refugee immigration polarizes conservatives and
   liberals equally. Yet, introducing the salience of women's rights leads
   to lower preferences for traditional values, particularly among more
   liberal respondents. Our findings demonstrate: 1) the study of backlash
   should distinguish individuals by their predisposition to backlash,
   rather than studying the population as a whole; and 2) social
   conservatives' backlash should be studied conjointly with social
   liberals' counter-reactions to backlash. Future research may investigate
   why different cultural threats provoke different reactions.},

Abstract = {Does providing information about the costs and benefits of automation
   affect the perceived fairness of a firm's decision to automate or
   support for government policies addressing automation's labor market
   consequences? To answer these questions, we use data from vignette and
   conjoint experiments across four advanced economies (Australia, Canada,
   the UK, and the US). Our results show that despite people's relatively
   fixed policy preferences, their evaluation of the fairness of
   automation-and therefore potentially the issue's political salience-is
   sensitive to information about its trade-offs, especially information
   about price changes attributable to automated labor. This suggests that
   the political impact of automation may depend on how it is framed by the
   media and political actors.},

Abstract = {Given women's gains in employment, education, and economic status, the
   persistent gender gap in internal political efficacy remains a puzzle
   for social scientists. We go beyond standard socioeconomic explanations
   and consider gender roles, which, unlike socioeconomic situation, are a
   slow-moving force constrained by gendered socialization. Stereotypically
   feminine traits jar with stereotypical notions of politics in general,
   as competitive, and leaders as power-seeking and assertive. Drawing on
   observational data from an original survey fielded in Spain, we show
   that this incongruence accounts for women's perception of having a low
   capacity to participate in politics. Results from a survey experiment
   suggest that this relationship is not set in stone, however. When
   politicians' motivation is framed in line with feminine traits-as a
   public service rather than a struggle for power-women consider
   themselves just as capable as men of participating in politics. The
   results have implications for women's political participation and
   representation in politics.},

Title = {The Environmental Defense Fund: Fighting the System by Guarding the
   Lifeworld as a Defensively Funded Environment},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) prides itself on its mission and
   legacy, namely, ``50 years of forging solutions that help people and
   nature prosper.{''} Has this solutionist approach to struggles along the
   frontiers of what Habermas identified as ``system{''} to defend
   ``life-world{''} actually helped people and nature prosper? The EDF has
   secured a relatively small number of protected stop-gap sites around the
   planet, which it oversees as specially ``funded defensible
   environments.{''} Yet, these interventions typically assist only certain
   peoples and specific locations. While it presents itself as an
   anti-establishment or market-resistant operation, the EDF also usually
   depicts its ``funded defensible environments{''} through the frames of a
   complex victimology in which ``the system{''} assaults ``the
   life-world.{''} It then can step forth as a third-sector ``public
   defender,{''} forging solutions through defensive legal actions meant to
   assure fairness and justice in environmental management through
   legalistic and/or market-based strategies. This analysis critically

Abstract = {This study explores how local politicians act when they are torn between
   local voters' views and their own views or the party line. Against the
   background of a recent municipal amalgamation reform in Norway that
   reduced the number of municipalities from 428 to 356, we conducted a
   survey experiment where the local representatives (N = 2,013) were
   treated with different outcomes from a hypothetical municipal referendum
   about a potential amalgamation. The results show that local officials
   representing the government parties are less likely to change their
   voting behaviour if the voters have view different position on the
   merger than the representative. They have strong incentives to show
   loyalty to government reform based on both an individual career prospect
   and from a multilevel governance framework. Unsurprisingly, we find that
   if voters and representatives share their views on the reform, the
   representatives will vote in line with the voters.},

Abstract = {A key finding of recent scholarship on political violence is that
   environmentalists rarely, if ever, use lethal violence. Many scholars
   have argued that ``ecoterrorism{''} is a misnomer for what is more
   accurately termed ``ecotage.{''} Large-n studies of environmental
   activism have identified only one apparent example of an environmentally
   motivated terrorist: the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski. The Unabomber case is
   therefore a ``crucial case{''} for evaluating the Peaceful
   Environmentalist Thesis-the generalization that environmentalists do not
   use lethal violence. Pioneering a forensic method of ideology analysis,
   this article uses previously unexamined archival material to assess the
   Unabomber's affinities with three environmental ideologies: radical
   environmentalism, green anarchism, and right-wing ecologism. It shows
   that the Unabomber's ideology is not environmentalist in intellectual
   origins or in conceptual structure, and that his motivations were
   anti-technological rather than pro-ecological. The Unabomber case
   demonstrates how ideology analysis can complement and strengthen
   research on political violence.},

Title = {Reducing Social Stratification Bias in Referendum Participation:
   Evidence from the German Local Level},

Abstract = {Political participation is socially distorted: Socio-economic resources
   affecting the probability of individuals becoming politically active
   question the principle of political equality. Such inequality in
   participation based on social stratification is well documented for
   elections, while research on inequality in referendum participation is
   still scarce. Based on the observation that such inequality varies
   between referendums, this paper explores referendum-specific contextual
   factors that may affect socially distorted referendum participation. We
   leverage information from an original dataset covering 1788 districts in
   35 German municipalities for 68 local referendums held between 2000 and
   2019. The results of our multilevel models indicate that concurrent
   first-order elections boost referendum turnout and decrease social
   stratification, while the closeness of the decision increases turnout
   but does not affect stratification bias. Moreover, we find a curvilinear
   relationship between turnout and stratification, with stratification
   only diminishing from participation levels above 40-50\%.},

Abstract = {Pepinsky, Goodman, and Ziller (2024, American Political Science Review,
   PGZ) reassess a recent study on the long-term consequences of
   concentration camps in Germany. The authors conclude that accounting for
   contemporary (i.e., post-treatment) state heterogeneity in the models
   provides unbiased estimates of the effects of camps on current-day
   outgroup intolerance. In this note, we show that PGZ's empirical
   strategy rests on (a) a mischaracterization of what regional fixed
   effects capture and (b) two unrealistic assumptions that can be avoided
   with pre-treatment state fixed effects. We further demonstrate that
   results from the original article remain substantively the same when we
   incorporate regional fixed effects correctly. Finally, simulations
   reveal that camp proximity consistently outperforms spatially correlated
   noise in this specific study. The note contributes to the growing
   literature on legacy studies by advancing the discussion about the
   correct modeling choices in this challenging field.},

Abstract = {Research shows that political parties are not equally responsive to the
   general public opinion and to their party voters' preferences. This
   study aims to explore this discrepancy in the context of politicians'
   perceptions of public opinion, recognising that the knowledge that
   politicians possess about public opinion is an important route for
   political representation. Are politicians better at perceiving the
   public opinion or their party voters' opinion? Departing from the
   approach of examining only one type of perception, this research
   investigates why some politicians have a more national-oriented pattern
   of perception, while others adopt a party-oriented pattern. Drawing on
   the literature on party responsiveness, this study develops and tests
   hypotheses regarding the role of party characteristics. Using survey
   data survey data from Belgium and Germany, the analysis reveals that,
   overall, party characteristics have a limited impact on MPs' perceptions
   of public opinion. However, a notable exception is intra-party
   democracy, which increases of politicians' propensity to better perceive
   the opinions of their own party voters compared to those of the general
   public.},

Abstract = {Ruling party strength is often associated with positive outcomes in
   autocracies, but we know little about how the effects of party strength
   differ across party types or which feature of party organization
   contributes most to better outcomes. This article argues that party
   infrastructural strength - the ability of grassroots party organizations
   to penetrate society and mobilize the masses - improves governance
   outcomes but only for authoritarian parties that rose to power through
   social movements that overthrew the existing political system. Parties
   that relied on mass mobilization to gain power tend to continue

   provide empirical support for my theory using data covering all
   autocratic ruling parties during the post-Second World War period. The
   findings have major implications for understanding the intellectual and

Title = {Soft power tools in Central Asia: towards a closer relationship with
   France},
Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},

Abstract = {Currently, France and the Central Asian countries are not limited to
   cooperation solely in the field of trading fossil fuels. For the further
   development of relations between their peoples, it is also necessary to
   give special attention to close cooperation in the fields of culture and
   education. This article analyses the primary sources of France's soft
   power in the Central Asian Republics while providing data on its
   position in the world rankings of states with the greatest soft
   influence. The authors present tables containing statistical data
   illustrating the extent of French language education and the promotion
   of culture and education in Central Asia, which are key elements of
   French soft power in the region. The study also identifies the most
   efficient and economical approaches for implementing soft power,
   especially under difficult epidemiological circumstances presented by
   COVID-19, via cultural and educational programmes. Therefore, in the
   present circumstances, these areas of collaboration should be deemed as
   means of preserving France's advantageous connection with the region.
   Correspondingly, the study highlights the factors that positively impact
   France's interest in the countries, alongside noteworthy cultural and
   educational collaborative undertakings in the current period.},

Abstract = {A distinctive feature of 21st-century constitution making is the role
   assigned to citizens through various forms of direct participation, as
   well as special efforts to include groups underrepresented and
   marginalized in ordinary politics. The legitimacy of these processes
   increasingly requires a role for actors and groups previously excluded
   from crucial institutional decisions (Elster 1998; Fishkin 2011;
   Reuchamps and Welp 2023; Rubio-Marin 2020; Welp and Soto 2020). However,
   vested interests have proven challenging to overcome amid a global
   crisis of representation. The failed Chilean process of 2021-2022
   provides valuable lessons about the triumphs and pitfalls of embracing
   an open approach to constitution making.},

Abstract = {This article critically engages with the Canadian framing of settler
   colonial/decolonial politics in terms of guilt and innocence. I argue
   that centring innocence, even as something to be snatched away from
   settlers, as with the theorization of settler moves to innocence, can
   corrupt the practice of moral responsibility. Furthermore, I argue that
   the desire for and expectation of innocence, in the face of structural
   injustices such as settler colonialism, are illusionary and that
   complicity is widespread. In contrast, I follow Iris Marion Young's
   focus on political responsibility, but I argue that public collective
   actions need not be as centred as she suggests. Given the nature of
   settler colonialism and of coloniality, I argue for the acknowledgment
   of the political significance of daily individual acts and for the
   cultivation of dispositions that disrupt unjust structures, such as a
   disposition to transgress.
   Cet article jette un regard critique sur le cadrage canadien de la
   politique coloniale d'etablissement/decoloniale en termes de culpabilite
   et d'innocence. Je soutiens que le fait de mettre l'accent sur
   l'innocence, meme comme une chose a arracher aux colons, comme c'est le
   cas dans la theorisation des mouvements des colons vers l'innocence
   (settler moves to innocence), peut corrompre l'exercice de la
   responsabilite morale. De plus, je soutiens que le desir et l'attente
   d'innocence face aux injustices structurelles comme le colonialisme
   d'etablissement sont illusoires, et que la complicite est largement
   repandue. En revanche, je m'inspire des travaux d'Iris Marion Young sur
   la responsabilite politique, en mettant toutefois moins l'accent que
   cette derniere sur les actions collectives publiques. Compte tenu de la
   nature du colonialisme d'etablissement et de la colonialite, je plaide
   pour la reconnaissance de la signification politique des actes
   individuels quotidiens et pour le developpement de dispositions qui
   perturbent les structures injustes, comme une disposition a la
   transgression.},

Abstract = {The extent in which voters from different ideological viewpoints support
   state interventions to curb crises remains an outstanding conundrum,
   marred by conflicting evidence. In this article, we test two possible
   ways out from such puzzle. The role of ideology to explain support for
   state interventions, we argue, could be (i) conditional upon the
   ideological nature of the crisis itself (e.g., whether the crisis
   relates to conservation vs. post-materialist values), or (ii) unfolding
   indirectly, by moderating the role played by political trust. We present
   evidence from a conjoint experiment fielded in 2022 on a representative
   sample of 1,000 Italian citizens, in which respondents were asked
   whether they support specific governmental interventions to curb a
   crisis, described under different conditions (e.g., type of crisis,
   severity). Our results show that the type of crisis matters marginally -
   right-wing respondents were more likely to support state interventions
   only in the case of terrorism. More fundamentally, political trust
   affects the probability to support state interventions, but only for
   right-wing citizens.},

Abstract = {Administrative agencies have undertaken an increasingly substantial role
   in policymaking. Yet the influence-seeking that targets these agencies
   remains poorly understood. Reporting exceptions under the Lobbying
   Disclosure Act allow many of the most powerful advocates to characterize
   their activity as lawyering, not lobbying, and thereby fly under the
   radar. Using agency-generated records on lobbying activity, financial
   reporting, and personnel databases specific to lawyers, as well as
   LinkedIn, we describe a vast subterranean world of regulatory
   influence-seeking that the social-science literature has (mostly)
   ignored. Regulatory lobbying is systematically different from
   legislative lobbying. It involves different kinds of people and
   different lobbying firms that bring specific forms of expertise and
   distinct networks. Our key findings about how regulatory lobbying
   differs include the following: (1) the regulatory lobbying sector is
   highly segregated from the reported lobbying sector, with many
   regulatory advocates failing to consistently register or report earnings
   commensurate with their activity level, (2) the number of unregistered
   regulatory advocates working on the implementation of the Dodd-Frank
   Wall Street Reform Act plausibly exceeds 150\% of the registered
   lobbyists working on that law, (3) the most effective regulatory
   lobbyists and law firms involved with regulatory lobbying have incomes
   that dramatically outpace leading reported lobbying firms (which are
   also mostly law firms), and (4) back-of-the-envelope calculations and
   more sophisticated decomposition regressions imply that aggregate
   expenditure on lawyer-lobbying is several multiples of reported lobbying
   spending. We introduce the case of a particular lawyer-lobbyist and
   provide a theoretical discussion to situate and contextualize these
   findings. Collectively, this work opens a window into neglected domains
   of politics and reveals an important and understudied form of political
   inequality.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical framework on strategic innovation in
   terrorist organizations. By comparing three historical organizations
   (ETA, PIRA, and Red Brigades), it seeks to understand the rationale and
   dynamics of strategic innovation. In doing so, it delineates this
   phenomenon as a process articulated in four stages: Evaluation,
   Formulation, Adoption, and Implementation. While the first two stages
   involve different actors, leadership is crucial during the stages of
   Adoption and Implementation. Additionally, the framework discusses how
   innovation is not necessarily related to escalations in violence and
   highlights an important difference between strategic change and
   strategic innovation. Finally, the paper explores the role of culture to
   then suggest areas for future research.},

Abstract = {New methods in neuroscience, which emerged at the turn of the 19th and
   20th centuries, allowed to make a breakthrough in comprehension of the
   human brain functioning principles, including the situations of ethical
   choice. The turn to the analysis of moral intuitions was so fruitful
   that it led to the flourishing of moral psychology, for which moral
   intuitions became the main research subject. Discoveries in neuroscience
   and moral psychology were bound to influence the areas of knowledge,
   where moral dilemmas and moral intuitions have traditionally been
   studied, primarily ethics and political philosophy. They have also
   affected political science. One of the most prominent and influential in
   its impact on ethics and political philosophy is the concept of deep
   pragmatism by Joshua Greene, based on numerous empirical studies of the
   human brain's response to ethical challenges. Another concept of equal
   and, potentially, even greater importance for these disciplines, and
   especially for political science, is moral foundations theory by
   Jonathan Haidt, which is also based on brain research and neural
   processes investigation. The article examines in detail Greene's
   research, which led him to articulate his own normative
   political-philosophical concept, as well as the concept of deep
   pragmatism itself. It shows that even though Greene attempts to distance
   himself from utilitarianism, his concept is, in fact, only a new
   iteration of the utilitarian theory of justice, which is inferior in
   terms of justification to other modern versions. In the final section of
   the article the author explores Haidt's moral foundations theory and its
   implications for philosophy and political science.},

Abstract = {Why has US commercial policy become increasingly politicized in the
   twenty-first century? We argue that this politicization reflects an
   interaction between elite rhetoric on unfair trade practices and
   American meritocratic values. As the twenty-first century progressed,
   elites increasingly argued that economic malaise was a result of
   predatory practices by US trading partners. This ``trade is unfair{''}
   rhetoric resonated most strongly with meritocratic Americans:
   individuals who believed in principles of market fairness but also
   worried about future economic prospects. To evaluate the argument that
   trade policy frames resonate differently among Americans, we draw on
   data from several survey experiments as well as a large, original panel
   data set with repeat observations of the same individuals. Individuals
   who are most tied to the myth of the classic American Dream are the most
   likely to respond to a frame blaming unfair trade for America's economic
   problems, and this contributes to rising antiglobalization sentiment.},

Title = {Facebook Campaigning in the 2019 and 2021 Canadian Federal Elections},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Canada's federal elections in 2019 and 2021 produced a similar outcome-a
   minority Liberal government. These back-to-back elections provide an
   ideal context to understand trends in digital campaigning strategies and
   assess how the pandemic influenced campaigns' use of social media. We
   examine how the three leaders of the major parties used Facebook in 2019
   (n = 712) compared to 2021 (n = 979). The Conservative leader O'Toole
   posted more frequently than other candidates in 2021, fitting with the
   equalization theory of digital campaigning. In 2019 and 2021, the
   incumbent prime minister, Trudeau, received the most user engagement on
   his Facebook posts despite calling a snap election during a pandemic and
   less than two years into his mandate. These findings support
   normalization theories of digital campaigning with evidence of an
   accumulating incumbent advantage. The Covid-19 pandemic sidelined
   attention to climate change. We argue that the Liberal government owned
   both issues; we expected Trudeau to have greater attention to and user
   engagement for these policy posts. In general, Facebook posts about the
   pandemic yielded greater user engagement than posts that did not mention
   the pandemic. Candidates tested new campaign strategies in 2021,
   particularly making calls to interact with them; these posts yielded
   higher user engagement than posts that did not include a call to
   interact. While candidates used new social media campaign strategies,
   voter turnout declined from 2019 to 2021. These findings have
   implications for other democratic systems and the future of digital
   campaigning.},

Abstract = {A robust literature on climate change and security developed in the
   2010s. Much of the literature attempts to chart how climate change could
   contribute directly or indirectly to conflict and instability through
   impacts on agriculture, migration, and disasters (Busby 2018; Koubi
   2019; Theisen 2017).1 The methodological challenge is that climate
   change is an emergent problem, wherein the security consequences largely
   have yet to occur. However, the field's methods and expertise are
   primarily explanatory of past patterns. For scholars who want to make

   article reviews the challenges for scholars in this space and identifies
   potential research strategies that might be pursued going forward.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to establish the nuances that comprise the
   concept of governance- or governmental capacity- from its preparation by
   the World Bank in the 1992 Governance and Development report. Based on
   the foundations of governance, according to this document,
   accountability and information transparency as main elements for the
   insertion of the population, from various social formations, in the
   political decision-making process and in the implementation of public
   policies. Participation, moreover, is one of the aspects of the micro
   level of accountability, at the same time as one of the variables of
   Dahl's polyarchical concept of democracy, denoting its indispensability
   for social development combined with economic development. In addition,
   informal insertion can break with corruptive stigmata of Power by
   allowing the merits analysis of political choices, while offering the
   possibility of indirect counterpoints by the Legislative and Judiciary
   to executive decisions. In the end, it is intended to demonstrate, from
   the eminently bibliographical study, how governance- good governance-
   will lead to responsible and sustainable development.},

Title = {What Role do Political Parties Play in Social Protests? Recent Trends in
   Argentina and Chile},
Journal = {DESAFIOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-19},
Abstract = {There is a growing consensus about the complementary nature of
   institutional and noninstitutional politics as means to push forward
   policy agendas. However, the bulk of research tends to concentrate on
   one aspect of this relationship, namely, how social movements influence
   the political arena, for example by impacting different stages of the
   policymaking process and creating new political parties. There is
   comparatively less understanding of the reverse dynamics: the degree to
   which political parties also influence the protest arena by adopting and
   utilizing strategies and tactics commonly associated with social
   movements and by connecting to demonstrators. Focusing on Argentina and
   Chile, two countries that have experienced massive protest waves in
   recent years, this article examines the presence of political parties in
   the organization, staging, and channeling of demonstrations. Given that
   the reception of political parties in demonstrations is closely tied to
   whether they are welcome in the protest arena or not, we also analyze
   how Argentine and Chilean protesters perceive political parties and the
   level of identification they feel with them. Our primary data source
   comes from 1 935 surveys conducted as part of the Caught in the Act of
   Protest: Contextualizing Contestation (ccc) network between 2015 and
   2017. We found that political parties in Argentina exhibit stronger ties
   to social movements compared to those in Chile. We seek to link this
   outcome to divergent and historically rooted patterns of protest
   dynamics in both countries and discuss the implications of our findings
   in the conclusion.},

Abstract = {This paper sketches the emergence of, and shifts within, the social,
   legal, and political figurations of sex workers in Poland. By adopting a
   genealogical perspective, I investigate how sex workers have been
   (re)constituted as subjects of governance and unimaginable social
   justice claimants in legislation, political debates, and law enforcement
   strategies. With a broad temporal scope, this article traces
   continuities, transformations, and disruptions within modes of sex work
   governance in Poland from the adoption of the first laws relating to sex
   work enacted during the early 19(th) century to the present day. Through
   analysis of policy documents, scholarly work on the history of sex work
   policies in Poland, and personal accounts by sex workers, I identify and
   examine two dominant discursive and legal figurations of a sex worker:
   as a threat, and as a victim in need of rescue and protection. While
   analysing the emergence of and interplay between these two figurations,
   this article demonstrates how these seemingly contradictory frames of
   recognition gradually conjoined within 20(th) -century Polish sex work
   governance strategies, rendering sex workers unimaginable subjects of
   rights and social justice claimants.},

Volume = {12},
Abstract = {This thematic issue of Politics and Governance offers a collection of
   unique articles that debate Indonesian ``heroes{''} and ``villains,{''}
   providing an understanding of the country's past and present. The
   importance of Indonesia in the world is ever-increasing geopolitically
   and economically, offering rich material for academic studies. It is one
   of the few Muslim-majority democracies, with a long and complex history
   of people and institutions that have shaped its national identity,
   politics, government, law, and security, which we examine under the
   central theme of agents of change and integration. The articles cover
   local histories prior to independence in 1945 to the present day, the
   legacy of President Abdurrahman Wahid (1999-2001), a biography of a
   prominent Muslim activist turned terrorist, women's agency in terrorism,
   as well efforts to reform terrorists. Discussions on the problematic
   aspects of the Indonesian state ideology Pancasila and the downgrading
   of Indonesia's Corruption Eradication Commission are also examined.
   Realpolitik is covered in the article concerning Indonesia's maritime
   security and in the article discussing activists who died fighting for
   democratic freedoms, such as Indonesian poet-activist Wiji Thukul, as
   unofficial heroes of the reform movement ( reformasi ), which toppled
   the Soeharto ``New Order{''} regime (1966-1998), leading to the
   democracy that Indonesia enjoys today.},

Abstract = {The editor-in-chief proposes a context for examining the crisis
   processes in American society explored in the articles. The author
   suggests that this crisis should be viewed in the context of the
   American history cycles. Many of the current conflicts in the USA have a
   similar internal source, which is a sharp intra-elite conflict involving
   a significant part of society. This conflict is unusual in its depth,
   given that for many decades the << trademark >> of the American
   political class has been its consensus character. One important element
   of this consensus can be seen as an unquestioned focus on global
   American leadership and a shared commitment among members of the
   community to the force imperatives in foreign policy - either the
   classic ``hard{''} or ``flexible{''} power. Among the sources of
   American foreign policy continuity are a number of factors. First, it is
   the stability of institutional mechanisms of decision-making, which, in
   turn, is based on a stable system of representation of dominant
   interests. Second, the stability of formal and informal institutions
   that ensure a high degree of elite cohesion; and the specificity of
   American political culture, which is based on a set of political and
   philosophical views of messianic nature. The consensual nature of the
   political elite was the system-forming basis of liberal democracy, so
   the breakdown of this consensus may entail - and partially has already
   entailed - a crisis of the US political system.},

Abstract = {Caribbean women have historically done productive and reproductive work
   that has been rendered less than visible and undervalued economically
   and socially for the state, family, and community. Emigration from the
   Caribbean to economically wealthier states across the Global North and
   South remains an important route to individual and familial improvement.
   Migrant women continue to fulfil ``family responsibilities{''}
   transnationally, even throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Concurrently,
   there are women who return to countries of birth to care for aging
   parents. With an aging population in Trinidad and Tobago, elder care
   becomes important not only to the state and how it allocates resources
   for this population, but also for children and families. But why do
   ``highly skilled{''} women return to do this proximate care work? With
   Marxian feminist analyses in mind, I detail the shared pressures and
   expectations on women that cross -cut class and income. From
   unstructured and semi -structured interviews with eight voluntary women
   returnees in Trinidad, I describe the reciprocal obligations at work to
   undervalue this reproductive labor. If privileged women are strained
   within present day conditions of austerity, even more socially and
   economically vulnerable women are further strained. The capitalist
   logics of work globally and Caribbean cultural particularities provide
   cover for this persistent undervaluing of reproductive labor, continuing
   systemic inequalities.},

Title = {Large language models as a substitute for human experts in annotating
   political text},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Large-scale text analysis has grown rapidly as a method in political
   science and beyond. To date, text-as-data methods rely on large volumes
   of human-annotated training examples, which place a premium on
   researcher resources. However, advances in large language models (LLMs)
   may make automated annotation increasingly viable. This paper tests the
   performance of GPT-4 across a range of scenarios relevant for analysis
   of political text. We compare GPT-4 coding with human expert coding of
   tweets and news articles across four variables (whether text is
   political, its negativity, its sentiment, and its ideology) and across
   four countries (the United States, Chile, Germany, and Italy). GPT-4
   coding is highly accurate, especially for shorter texts such as tweets,
   correctly classifying texts up to 95\% of the time. Performance drops
   for longer news articles, and very slightly for non-English text. We
   introduce a `hybrid' coding approach, in which disagreements of multiple
   GPT-4 runs are adjudicated by a human expert, which boosts accuracy.
   Finally, we explore downstream effects, finding that transformer models
   trained on hand-coded or GPT-4-coded data yield almost identical
   outcomes. Our results suggest that LLM-assisted coding is a viable and
   cost-efficient approach, although consideration should be given to task
   complexity.},

Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Number = {46},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Although internal displacement of persons has been witnessed in Kenya
   over the years, the 2007/08 episode was the most severe. This study was
   conducted to examine the socio-economic characteristics of the
   internally displaced population (IDPs) and to assess the nature of the
   initial resettlement among the displaced population at the Nakuru
   Pipeline Complex, Nakuru County, Kenya. The study used a survey design
   and sampled 260 households from the resettlement register.
   Questionnaires which included the household displacement deprivation
   scale and key informant guide were used. Indicators that were rated
   worst (i.e., severely or rarely available or accessible) at the time of
   the initial settlement in 2008 included loss of self-esteem (82\%), loss
   of income (82\%), loss of employment (78\%), lack of shelter (81\%) and
   loss of property (71\%). By 2018, there were considerable improvements
   (recovery) that included housing (72.0\%), food access (63.0\%), water
   (57.0\%), and clothing (54.0\%) compared to the initial crisis periods.
   Given the occurrence of processes that induce disasters and
   displacement, social development efforts should be directed to the
   reduction of vulnerabilities, including socio-ecological
   vulnerabilities. Such measures will ensure that when disasters and
   displacements occur, it will be possible for the people, and citizens,
   to recover, adapt to new environments, and continue with their
   livelihoods. Reduction of severity in magnitude and duration will need
   to be an integral part of the social development planning.},

   mainly based were put on the table. Two visions that have been equally
   present, and in dispute, in the development of other decentralization
   systems in our western environment, and which can be reconduced to the
   concepts of dual federalism and cooperative/coercive federalism. From
   the Constitutional Court's interpretation of our model, it can be
   deduced that the degree of autonomous self-government is variable and
   dynamic, since what the autonomous communities can or cannot do will
   depend on how the central State has exercised its constitutional powers

Abstract = {Turkmenistan's enforcement apparatus is a central pillar of the
   autocratic regime. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991,
   the tasks and methods employed by the state security service and the
   police remained largely unchanged. Following the death of the
   Turkmenistan's first president, Saparmyrat Nyjtazow, his successor,
   Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, saw to a purge of the institutions'
   personnel. But they remained a repressive apparatus where corruption and
   abuse of power are the order of the day. It has been no different under
   his successor, son Serdar Berdimuhamedow. The regime pays significantly
   less attention to the army. This is related to the state doctrine of
   ``eternal neutrality{''}.},

Abstract = {The special constitutional relevance is a critic dialogical instrument
   from the perspective of multilevel constitutionalism and, especially, is
   a privileged conversational element between the Spanish Constitutional
   Court and the European Court of Human Rights. The need to adapt the
   constitutional jurisprudence of the Spanish Constitutional Court to the
   case law of the European Court of Human Rights as a cause of special
   constitutional relevance institutionalizes a practice already followed
   by the Constitutional Court by virtue of art 10.2 of the Spanish
   Constitution. Now, in addition, two further aspects are incorporated: a
   principle of collaboration between the appellants in amparo and the
   Court in the detection of new developments in the international systems,
   and the reinforcement of the Constitutional Court as a principal mean
   for channeling the European jurisprudence to ordinary justice.},

Abstract = {Social inequality is a phenomenon that is ambivalent in its
   consequences. On the one hand, social inequality stimulates creative and
   entrepreneurial activity; on the other hand, it provokes social
   discontent. At the same time, the attitude towards inequality that has
   developed in the society is of particular importance. Perception of
   inequality as unfair is fraught with delegitimization of the upper
   class, loss of social trust between strata, and anomie. The article
   attempts to answer the following questions: what type of inequality do
   Russians agree to consider fair, what methods of enrichment and social
   ascent are legitimized by public consciousness? Empirically, the study
   is based on a series of focus groups conducted by the authors in 2013
   and 2023. The study found that in modern Russia, the majority of the
   population criminalizes wealth, regardless of its origin, considering it
   ``dishonest{''}. In the eyes of Russians, only those who serve their
   country, provide noble help to people and, finally, possess great
   talent, which is used for the benefit of everyone, are entitled to
   receive high income. The mass consciousness rejects the idea of
   inheriting status and capital, which is manifested, in particular, in a
   very critical attitude towards the generation of children of the
   post-Soviet elite. The study showed that the Russians' dream fair
   society is radically different from the existing one. At the same time,
   the authors documented a trend towards an increase in social pessimism
   associated with a feeling of injustice of the socio-economic system
   based on the cult of money, and an increase in anomie, corroding the
   body of society.},

Abstract = {This article addresses three views on the Brazilian Revolution, which
   was a central theme in Brazilian left organizations over the years, and
   on the part of the intelligentsia engaged in the social reforms that the
   Jo \& atilde;o Goulart government tried to implement in Brazil between
   1963-1964, and which generated the military coup in 1964. Two
   perspectives, although different, that of Nelson Werneck Sodr \& eacute;
   and Guerreiro Ramos supported the Jango government's nationalist
   reforms, while Moniz Bandeir \& aacute;s perspective was opposed,
   classifying that these reforms would be insufficient for the Brazilian
   Revolution.},

Title = {Maintaining Regional Stability amid Complex Regime Transitions in
   Africa: Challenges and Opportunities for COMESA Member States},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {With a market reach of approximately 600 million people and straddling
   21 countries, the COMESA bloc occupies a vast chunk of the continent.
   Contemporary literature on the region generally points to huge
   macroeconomic potential in as far as the holistic developmental and
   wealth creation projections are concerned. Nonetheless, a sizeable
   number of COMESA countries have, from time to time, experienced phases
   of complex regime transition, a state of affairs that comes with an aura
   of regional instability, thereby undermining the prosperity prospects of
   a trading bloc that boasts a combined GDP of US\$ 768 billion. Over the
   past decade, a sizeable number of these countries have been faced with
   one form or another of political turmoil and assorted civil strife,
   especially within the context of regime transitions and/or change of
   power from one government to the next. Against this background, through
   the lenses of neofunctionalism and liberal institutionalist theories,
   this paper examines the question of how best to ensure and/or maintain
   regional stability in the midst of such complex regime transitions, with
   the view of teasing out the challenges and opportunities before offering
   sustainable policy recommendations for COMESA countries.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to analyze to what extent the students of secondary
   school for youths and adults have been affected by phenomena that show a
   deterioration in their reproductive conditions during recent history.
   Although the specialized bibliography on the subject indicates that the
   students of the modality are crossed by issues such as unemployment,
   poverty and job precariousness, there are a series of limitations to
   know to what degree this is the case throughout the national territory
   and if there have been changes over time. Seeking to contribute to the
   issue, from a quantitative methodology an approximation to the situation
   of the population group from which the students come is made based on
   the Permanent Household Survey between the years 2003 and 2018. The main
   argument raised is that students have extremely degraded reproductive
   conditions that are linked to their belonging to the relative surplus
   population, although they have not remained unchanged, but have
   generally evolved in tune with the Argentine economic cycle.},

Abstract = {The aim of the paper is to examine intra-party democracy (IPD) in Poland
   over time, assess whether it has increased or declined, and explore
   generational differences among parties. We analysed parties that entered
   parliament following the 2023 elections. Our study was based on content
   analysis of party statutes, employing the analytical framework developed
   by von dem Berge et al. (2013). We assumed that the level of IPD changed
   over time and that parties established within a mature political system
   would exhibit higher levels of IPD than those founded during the early
   stages of political transformation. We also hypothesised that newer
   parties would prove more inclined to involve their members in
   decision-making processes and to use plebiscitary intra-party democracy
   (PIPD). However, our findings revealed a more ambiguous picture than
   anticipated. No significant differences between the partieswere
   identified. Assembly-based intra-party democracy (AIPD) seemed to be the
   standard in parties of all generations, with only a few exceptions where
   some form of PIPD was used as a complementary approach.},

Abstract = {My article will explore the agenda and the role of corporatist theories
   and practices in inter-war Greece. Corporatism played a marginal role in
   Greek politics at the time. For all its solemn proclamations that Greece
   would be organised as a corporatist state, the Fourth of August regime
   under General Ioannis Metaxas (1936-1941) did not break with past
   economic thought and policies. Drawing on primary material, I will argue
   that corporatist ideas and institutions in Greece mostly served
   socio-political rather than economic interests. Politicians, economists
   and social scientists, such as Georgios Merkouris, Demosthenes
   Stefanidis, Ioannis Tournakis and Dimitrios Panou, who espoused and
   propagated the cause of corporatism, placed great emphasis on the
   `national' and the disciplinary role of this system of thought. Their
   main aim was to eradicate class struggle and to instil harmony and
   cooperation in labour relations. Following the fascist example, General
   Metaxas applied these principles through authoritarian and harsh police
   methods.},

Title = {Walking Together in a Pandemic: Reflections on a Semester of Place,
   Decolonization, and Classroom Community},
Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {915-939},
Abstract = {In this co-authored reflection by seven graduate students and one
   instructor, we revisit the ``Apocalyptic Feminisms{''} graduate class
   taught in Fall 2020, at the height of the pandemic, in which students
   were asked to engage with interdisciplinary writing on the Anthropocene
   and to hone their own feminist praxes through going on and documenting
   their walks. We reflect on the ``Walk and Movement Reading Instagram
   Engagements{''} assignment, exploring what walking can offer to deepen
   theoretical, methodological, and praxis-based approaches to
   environmental and place- based learning. We do this by writing from a
   cascading voice approach, where each reflection stands on its own and
   together builds into a whole greater than its parts. Following on an
   introduction to the course and assignment, we begin with a conceptual
   outlining of the meanings of place, decolonization, and academic
   community. Next, each of the graduate student collaborators responds to
   the following prompt, ``How did the walking project on IG {[}Instagram]
   influence how you thought about questions of place, decolonization, and
   classroom community during a pandemic?{''}Each co-author develops a
   robust engagement with this question drawing on their own pandemic Fall
   2020 semester, their photographs from the course, and the insights and
   practices they developed in conversation with each other throughout the
   span of the semester. Together, this reflection offers thoughts on the
   feminist and place-based utilities of walking pedagogy as well as,
   through collaboration, challenges the very way in which academic
   scholarship is done at the site of the late capitalist academy and its
   topos of success, competition, and meritocracy.},

Pages = {213+},
Abstract = {Indigenous peoples have inalienable rights, particularly the right to
   collective self-determination. Among the indigenous peoples of Russia,
   such as the Nenets and Khanty, both collective self-consciousness and
   awareness of such rights are poorly developed. Commodity companies, with
   the support of the state, are destroying their land and depriving them
   of the possibility of continuing their traditional way of life. But the
   indigenous communities are atomized. The violence of collectivisation,
   the murder of their leaders, and forced assimilation have deprived these
   peoples of a distinct sense of self and turned the people into subjects
   of the state. Russia's war against Ukraine has made the situation even
   worse. However, members of these peoples now living in exile are
   developing an awareness that their communities have been victims of
   colonisation ever since the conquest of Siberia.},

Title = {THE FUTURE IMAGE AS A COMPONENT OF POLITICAL SUBJECTIVE SPACE: TESTING
   THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {5},
Pages = {66-81},
Abstract = {. The image of the future of youth is described in this paper and its
   relationship with the subjective space of politics is identified. The
   article provides a brief analysis of research on the image of the future
   within the framework of social and political sciences, describes the
   main theoretical approaches to analyzing the future image of youth. The
   authors give their own conceptual definition of the future image as a
   component of the political subjective space, a set of symbolic,
   ideological and cultural meanings that determine the orientation and
   behavior of various political actors. The authors as a methodology use
   focus group interviews, online questionnaires of youth representatives
   in order to verify the conceptual model of the study. The dynamic nature
   of the future image as a part of political subjective space is
   determined by a system of institutions, agents and factors of
   socialization. Five key components have been identified in the structure
   of the future image: content, value, emotions, activity and technology.
   Four projection levels of the future image are defined: personal, group,
   projection at the level of the macro community and global. The study
   indicates the predominance of personal projection in the respondents'
   ideas about the future. Despite the presence of worries and fears for
   their personal future, young people are generally confident in their own
   future and believe that the Russian state will continue to play an
   important role as a world power. An important characteristic of the
   future image is the subjectivity of its bearer, the degree of activity
   or proactivity and the willingness to take responsibility for their own
   future and the future of their families, local community, region,
   country, and the world. Locus control, that is, a subjective assessment
   of the factors (personal efforts or external circumstances) on which the
   future depends, according to the study, is associated with the degree of
   confidence in the future, the formation of a positive future image. The
   predominance of civic identity in the hierarchy of identities is also
   revealed. Young people feel responsible for the future of their country.
   At the moment, Russian civic identity has a positive impact on the
   future image of young people. It is significant that among students
   studying in the Luhansk People's Republic, the level of concern about
   the future is higher, the level of civil identity is lower, which
   indicates that the task of forming civil identity should be prioritized
   in the new regions of the Russian Federation.},

Abstract = {The Amazon is fundamental for the preservation of life on Earth. In the
   2022 Brazilian electoral cycle, this biome became a central axis of
   public debate due to the relaxation of environmental laws, the
   resurgence of conflicts over `legal' and illegal extractivism, the
   impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the violations of the human rights
   of indigenous peoples and traditional communities that coexist in this
   region of this country. This reflection article proposes an analysis of
   the speeches made by the candidates Jair Bolsonaro and Lula da Silva,
   regarding the Amazon, in three representative moments: Bolsonaro's
   mandate, the presidential campaign in 2022 and the transition to Lula's
   third government. To this end, M \& eacute;sz \& aacute;ros' critical
   perspective is adopted to elucidate the issues of sociometabolic order,
   mediations and reification that underlie these discourses situated in
   the context of the environmental degradation of the Amazon biome and the
   socio-environmental conflicts exacerbated by the structural crisis of
   capital. It concludes by vindicating the ecological transcendence of
   this biome and community political participation as a historic
   opportunity to expand democratic life in Brazil.},

Abstract = {The article presents the results of the analysis and systematization of
   discourses describing the dynamics and key areas of social development.
   The purpose of the study is to determine the guidelines and priorities
   in discussions on development that dominate the research and expert
   agenda, and to identify the ideas and meanings that are invested in this
   concept by actors participating in public discussions and political
   goal-setting. The research methodology is based on the structural and
   functional approach, and on comparative evaluation of the target
   settings present in the current expert discussion and in public policy-
   making. A quantitative content analysis of a sample of EU documents
   defining priorities of interaction with third countries to achieve
   development goals is offered as an illustrative example. The conclusions
   are presented in the form of a conceptual tree constructed by
   correlating the main concepts that exist in the research and expert
   field dealing with social development discourses and their political
   implications. According to the results of the study, the ideological
   appeal of narratives circulating in the public space of the ``developed
   world{''} and the normative projection of this agenda worldwide
   transform discursive power into discursive hegemony through ``green
   colonialism{''} and other forms of ``promoting development{''}. The
   authors take a critical approach to the monopolization of the expert and
   political field by the concept of ``sustainable development{''} which is
   widely regarded as a politically correct approach and a universalist
   political attitude. An ambiguous understanding of ``social
   development{''} beyond the progressive paradigm and purely normative
   approaches in the social sciences makes the need to clarify this concept
   all the more urgent. The paper proposes to interpret ``political
   development{''} as a multidimensional process leading to the
   complication of political interactions and not limited to institutional
   change, and ``politics of development{''} as a system of management
   practices correlated with the public demand for security and social
   well-being. The current research agenda in this field in Russia aims to
   promote the analysis of the subjective dimension of politics, with a
   focus on identity studies and on evaluating intangible development
   resources.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyse active labour market policy efficiency for
   rural young NEETs integration into the labour market in the
   socioeconomic context of rural municipalities in Lithuania. For the
   empirical analysis, the administrative data of the public employment
   service concerning active labour market policy measures, e.g., training
   and mobility support, subsidised employment, and support for
   establishing or adapting workplaces of 2018 and 2022, as well as
   Lithuanian statistics data of 2018 and 2020 are used. The socio-economic
   environment of rural municipalities was analysed using the economic
   indicators (complex index), public transport accessibility, average
   wage, and free vacancies indicators. The recipient's integration into
   employment after six months of participation in active labour market
   policy measures is analysed. The data revealed poor economic indicators,
   undeveloped public transport, lower average salaries, and a need for
   more vacancies in rural municipalities. The integration into employment
   fell significantly in two rural municipality clusters after the Covid-19
   pandemic.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is twofold: on the one hand, to show the
   impacts of the presence of drug trafficking in the Ucayali region, to
   reveal a situation that, except in very rare cases, is not currently on
   the public agendas, among the political or economic priorities, in the
   parliamentary debates and in jurisdictional decisions. On the other
   hand, it is to make a direct and effective proposal to resolve the old
   and most recent dilemmas represented by drug trafficking related to
   cocaine and its derivatives, its causes, and consequences for the
   Indigenous Peoples who inhabit the Peruvian Amazon. The case of the
   Ucayali region, a strategic region located in the central Peruvian
   Amazon, region is taken. Official information from the Peruvian State,
   that comes from international organizations, as well as from the
   indigenous organizations and private entities that work in the region
   have been reviewed. The article concludes by identifying an order of
   actions that must be carried out by the Peruvian State in the Ucayali
   region, to achieve a closure of the historical social gaps that are
   found at the base of the territory where drug trafficking has been
   established.},

Abstract = {. The aim of the study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of
   discursive strategies for legitimizing the United States (U.S.)
   sanctions policy against Russia during the Biden Administration. The
   paper is based on a constructivist theory within the study of
   international relations and methodological innovations by T. van Dijk,
   T.J. van Leeuwen, R. Wodak. The research investigates the hypothesis
   that the absence of an international legal framework for anti-Russian
   sanctions creates an increased need for the United States to legitimize
   them. The work uses critical discourse analysis (CDA) to investigate
   discursive strategies of legitimization of U.S. sanctions against Russia
   (through 1) emotions; 2) hypothetical future; 3) procedures; 4) expert
   opinion; 5) altruism). The study shows that anti-Russian sanctions is a
   part of the hegemonic foreign policy of the United States. It is
   manifested, reproduced, and justified through the official narrative.
   Political discourses containing ideological attitudes are used by the
   United States to create, maintain and protect its identity, which is
   based on the binary opposition ``Self-Positive Representation -
   Other-Negative Representation{''} and has a projection on the country's
   foreign policy. The most convincing discursive strategies of
   legitimization are those that appeal to the fundamental pillars of
   American identity (strategies 1, 2, 5). Strategies that rely on more
   specific/ situational grounds and argumentation systems are the least
   convincing (strategies 3, 4).},

Abstract = {This contribution assesses how political philosophy may provide a
   contribution to European studies. The European Union brings major
   challenges for modern philosophy, which relate first to the
   identification of its political form. But to this explanatory account is
   joined a normative dimension: what is at stake is to identify what would
   be for the Union the appropriate form of sovereignty and government. To
   this extent, political philosophy may state the principles which must
   legitimately organize the European Union - principles which guide the
   improvement of its institutions by aiming for democracy, freedom and

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This article analyses the historical role of traditional healers
   (n'anga/ chiremba) in conflict resolution in Zimbabwe. Historically,
   traditional healers occupied a powerful position in Zimbabwean society.
   Not only were they healers but they also handled social problems and
   contributed to peace and reconciliation. However, colonial rule in
   Zimbabwe (18901980) ushered in a spirited challenge to the authority of
   traditional healers. They were ridiculed as fraudsters who perpetuated
   unfounded superstitions. Colonial legal and justice systems replaced
   traditional conflict resolution institutions that had been manned by
   traditional healers. Nonetheless, traditional healers continued to exist
   underground. Notwithstanding that, their role and contribution to
   peacebuilding remains on the fringe of academic inquiry. The key
   question that this article addresses is how and under what conditions
   traditional healers contributed to conflict resolution at the grassroots
   level. The article focuses mostly on records of conflict and violence in
   court cases, underscoring how witnesses' evidence brought attention to
   the role of traditional healers in reconciliation. It demonstrates the
   various contexts in which traditional healers' interventions were
   alluded to but ignored in the state's attempts to administer justice. By
   digging up obscured and misrepresented evidence of traditional healers'
   practices in conflict resolution in the colonial archive and in-depth
   interviews, we unravel this understated but most crucial element in the
   process of conflict resolution in Zimbabwe since 1890.},

Title = {The ``sincere{''} Sicily of Luigi Capuana},
Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2024},
Number = {33},
Abstract = {In this contribution, I look at the discursive ethos of ``sincerity{''}
   employed by Luigi Capuana, from Bozzetti su alcune usi e credenze
   religiose (1866) to L'Isola del sole (1898), when writing about Sicily.
   The author plays on paradoxical double allegiances; he often exempts the
   speaker-narrator from any responsibility, from precise polyphonic
   hierarchies of the conflict between the Sicily of the ``mainland{''} and
   the Sicily of the Sicilians: his vision of Sicily, though mythologised
   in an anhistorical framework, fails to become an autonomous point of
   view. However, the essays examined are characterised, albeit in
   different ways, by the exhibition of a precarious cultural capital and
   the modesty of a self-justification based, in discursive terms, on
   ``sincerity{''}. Looking diachronically at this interrupted discourse on
   Sicily, we observe how Capuana stages a Sicilian ``I{''} that is more
   apophatic than assertive, more apologetic than militant, holding up a
   mirror to the contradictions of his social trajectory, to the narrative
   of his journey as a Sicilian author. Capuana's discourse seems to refer
   to a continuous paratext of excusatio and peroratio, to a permanent
   scenography of requalification.},

Title = {MASS CONSCIOUSNESS OF RUSSIAN YOUTH: IMAGE OF THE FUTURE},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {6},
Pages = {154-169},
Abstract = {This is the second text within the all-Russian research on the image of
   the future in the mass consciousness using the methods of empirical
   sociology. In 2021-2024, researchers conducted 67 focus groups in 25
   regions from Moscow to Kamchatka. In addition to diverse geography, the
   authors consider all types of localities as a research space: from
   supercities to small towns and villages. Two key methods are used: focus
   groups and psychography. Images of Russia in the present and in the
   future are described not only using words, but also presented in
   pictures by respondents. This text focuses on the study of mass
   consciousness of young people (age 18-30) and more local trends in
   geographical, generational, political and economic senses. The text
   highlights eight key trends in the mass consciousness of young people:
   socialization within Western culture, the highest level of paternalism
   (including the desired restoration of certain Soviet practices),
   weakening frustration due to cancel culture regarding Russia and its
   citizens from the West, demonstrative public depoliticization, permanent
   desire for a peaceful future with Russia's leading role in the
   international arena, etc. Despite the uneven attitude towards state
   institutions, the Fatherland is perceived by the mass consciousness of
   young people as a place to apply their own efforts to build a career and
   solve problems. The results of the study demonstrate the highest margin
   of safety of the Russian state, which has no alternatives regarding the
   construction of the image of the future.},
