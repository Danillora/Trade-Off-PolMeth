Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to define political memes as belonging to the
   genre of political satire and part of Romanian political culture, to
   outline their characteristics and functionality, and to indicate that
   the phenomenon of political meme-sharing is a cultural phenomenon with
   growing significance based on the highly affective usage of memes that
   allow for the recontextualization of past political events in accordance
   with the new realities of the Romanian political and cultural space.
   Using the case study that is included, which takes into account how the
   awareness of the political context is the basis of the memes and the
   features of the memes themselves, the author shows that memes can be
   considered a type of informal, non-conventional form of political
   participation and considers this in relation to the political landscape
   of a post-communist country, thus determining that memes are a novel
   element that should be considered when dealing with civic culture at
   large, and digital civic culture specifically.},

Abstract = {The transition towards green and clean energy sources is the need of the
   day and a key target for several economies across the globe. Besides,
   emerging economies also aim to minimize fossil fuel dependence,
   promoting the adoption of green electricity. However, several obstacles,
   including governance, corruption and economic-related issues, are
   forthcoming in attaining sustainability in the context of green energy.
   This research examines seven emerging economies from 1990 to 2020. The
   study uses novel panel diagnostic assessment approaches, which validate
   the slope heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence and confirm the
   cointegration between the study variables. Employing the method of
   moments quantile regression, this research concludes that corruption and
   governance quality adversely influence the transition to green
   electricity. On the other hand, the influence of economic complexity,
   research and development expenditures and per capita GDP is positive and
   significant. These results are robust as validated by estimators such as
   mean group and fully modified ordinary least squares. Furthermore, a
   twoway Granger causality exists between regressors and green energy
   transition, which allows this research to offer appropriate policy
   implications. This study recommends improving institutions,
   strengthening bureaucracy, enhancing accountability and investing in
   research and development, green technologies and human capital to
   encourage green energy transition.},

Abstract = {Unanticipated changes in tax policy are likely to have different
   macroeconomic effects compared to anticipated changes due to several
   mechanisms. It is therefore important to understand what drives such
   policy surprises. We explore the nature of unanticipated tax policy
   changes by focusing on a political economy determinant of those events,
   namely the timing of elections. Using monthly data for 22 advanced
   economies and emerging markets over the period 19902018, we show that
   implementation lags tend to be longer for tax policy change
   announcements that are made during pre-election periods, thereby leading
   to a lower likelihood of ``tax news shocks{''}. We also find that
   implementation lags become much shorter for tax policy changes that are
   announced in the aftermath of elections. This pattern remains similar
   for different tax measures and types of taxes. The findings are robust
   to a number of checks, including controlling for various economic,
   institutional and political factors.},

Title = {Understanding Government Public Opinion: How Conspiracy Mentality and
   Policy Issue Concerns Shape Government Performance Evaluations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Citizens' assessments of government performance are rooted in their
   judgement on how public policy responds to their concerns, a key element
   for a sustainable democracy. However, conspiracy mentality, where
   individuals believe in larger plans orchestrated by powerful entities or
   the government, may impact such judgement. To examine the antecedents to
   people's assessment about how well the government responds to salient
   issues in society, this study examines the connection between citizens'
   policy concerns, conspiracy mentality, and their assessment of
   government performance. Analyzing data from an original two-wave panel
   survey conducted in the United States using cross-sectional, lagged, and
   autoregressive causal ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models,
   the study shows that conspiracy mentality is positively related to
   policy issue concerns, while policy issue concerns are negatively
   associated with the perception of government performance. Importantly,
   policy issues concerns significantly mediated this relationship.
   Individuals with higher levels of conspiracy mentality are more likely
   to have issue concerns that ultimately shape their negative views on how
   well the government addresses important problems in society.},

Abstract = {We study the institutional impact 21st-century left-leaning populist
   regimes have in Latin America. Looking at the iconic left-leaning
   populist regimes in Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and
   Venezuela, we find that these types of populist regimes impose a
   significant deterioration on the liberal-democracy institutional quality
   of their countries. The institutional cost is significant and
   long-lasting, and our synthetic counterfactual suggests that liberal
   democratic institutions would have improved if not for these populist
   regimes.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the significance of the concept of a social
   formation for historical materialism. It argues that the concept is
   wrongly thought to be associated uniquely with the writings of Louis
   Althusser and with structuralist Marxism. It can be found in the
   writings of Marx himself, as well as those of Lenin, and is central to
   an adequate understanding of classical Marxism. To illustrate its
   importance the paper shows how the concept may be used to shed new light
   on the debate around the transition from feudalism to capitalism.},

Abstract = {Mixed-ownership reform (the Reform) is crucial for the construction of a
   modern market economy. Through a proprietary data set of 32 provinces in
   China, we find that government intelligent transformation (GIT) can
   attract private firms acquiring local state-owned enterprises (SOEs),
   and such link is stronger among target firms in central and western
   regions, and acquirers with lower competitive positions and higher
   levels of digital transformation. Additionally, we also find this effect
   exists both in local and nonlocal private firms. Further tests suggest
   that GIT can regulate government behaviors, reduce relational
   transactions, and enhance local policy environment quality and the level
   of local market legal governance, thereby promoting private firms to
   participate in the Reform. Moreover, in the provinces with higher levels
   of GIT, there is a greater likelihood that private firms will gain
   control rights over SOEs and obtain more resources following the Reform.
   Our findings may have policy implications for the world's largest
   emerging market.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesIn this article, we consider how the COVID-19 pandemic and
   evaluations of Donald Trump combined to influence Americans' attitudes
   toward U.S. trade practices with China. We suggest that psychological
   factors-such as confirmation bias and transfer of grievances-influence
   how individuals evaluate the costs and benefits of trade. Specifically,
   we argue that the severity of the pandemic (reflected by both cumulative
   deaths and news coverage of the pandemic) and the rhetoric of (then)
   President Trump came together to influence Americans' attitudes toward
   trade with China.MethodsTo assess the COVID effect, the Trump effect,
   and their interaction effect on trade opinion, we merge data from 39
   waves of the weekly Nationscape surveys, conducted from October 2019 to
   July 2020 (N = 62,171), with data on weekly COVID coverage for nine
   national news sources and cumulative state-level weekly data on
   COVID-related deaths. We estimate our models using hierarchical ordered
   logit.ResultsOur findings suggest that COVID-related news coverage,
   cumulative COVID deaths, and Americans' favorability toward Donald Trump
   have strong positive effects on Americans' support for trade tariffs on
   Chinese imports. Further, we find that the effects of COVID deaths on
   attitudes toward China tariffs are moderated by Trump favorability, with
   the effect of COVID deaths significantly stronger among Trump
   favorables.ConclusionThe COVID pandemic and evaluations of Donald Trump
   worked both independently and together to shape Americans' attitudes
   toward China tariffs.},

Title = {The Spectacle of Invisibility: Vanishing Points and the Spatialised
   Legal Violence of the UK's Expanding Quasi-Carceral Geography of
   Immigration Control},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 13},
Abstract = {Increasingly, irregularized migrants are pushed to rely on more and more
   clandestine means in attempts to reach so-called safe havens in Europe
   and elsewhere. Often, these actions are necessitated by governments
   instituting ever-more hostile and violent mechanisms of immigration
   control. Taking as its focus key developments in the UK's morphing and
   expanding `quasi-carceral geography' of immigration control, this paper
   considers some of these developments alongside Derek Gregory's incisive
   essay titled analysis of `vanishing points'. The paper examines how the
   spectacular and invisible are instrumentalized simultaneously to produce
   spatialised legal vanishing points in the UK and beyond by scrutinising
   three distinct yet interconnected sites where vanishing points
   materialise, each successively more proximate to UK geographical
   terrain. Specifically, I examine the multi-scalar legal contestations
   that surrounded the UK-Rwanda Agreement; the invisibility and tactical
   ambiguities of juxtaposed border controls in Northern France; and the
   downgrading of rights, responsibilities, and accountability in amended
   rules for the accommodation of irregular migrant arrivals, focusing on
   the former military barracks of Manston, Kent, UK. Drawing on Gregory's
   analysis as a framework, the paper traces the significance not only of
   law's presence or suspension but also its application, morphing, and
   contestation within these sites - and more generally - for the emergence
   and functioning of a continuum of extra-territorial, ambiguous,
   discretionary, violent spaces where possibilities for sanctuary, safe

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis study aims to explore the school experiences of Japanese
   American children and teenagers who were incarcerated in camps during
   World War II following the issuance of Executive Order 9066 on February
   19, 1942.MethodsThe study examines video interviews available in
   Densho's online archive, focusing on the educational experiences of
   second-generation Japanese Americans who resumed their education in the
   camps.ResultsThe analysis reveals that many interviewees reported
   positive experiences in camp schools, despite the poor conditions. A key
   factor contributing to these positive experiences was the dedication of
   teachers, who not only promoted academic success but also addressed the
   psychological and emotional needs of the incarcerated
   students.ConclusionWhile many interviewees highlighted the supportive
   role of teachers, the negative effects of incarceration on their school
   experiences cannot be overlooked, as a significant number recalled
   unpleasant aspects of their education in the camps. Moreover, the
   incarceration of Japanese Americans still has contemporary implications.},

Abstract = {News comments are a great space for citizen interaction, albeit they
   lack the rationale that would account for an online deliberative space.
   Through an experiment embedded into a population-based survey, this
   study seeks to explain how different levels of both incivility and
   disagreement affect readers on two key variables: negative emotions and
   user participation. Results show that the exposure to both incivility
   alone and uncivil disagreement increases negative emotions by the
   reader, such as anxiety and anger. However, contrary to what literature
   suggested, incivility by itself was the group with the biggest increase
   on negative emotions. In terms of online participation (e.g. putting an
   extra like in a comment), results showed no evidence to indicate a
   relationship between incivility, disagreement, and online participation.
   These results support previous findings suggesting that the exposure to
   online political incivility has mainly negative consequences.},

Title = {How Does Topical Diversity Affect Source Credibility? Fact-Checking
   Coverage of Politics, Science, and Popular Culture},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 27},
Abstract = {News sources that correct misinformation seek to foster an informed
   citizenry and promote democratic accountability. One such effort is
   being made by fact-checking sites across the globe. However, public
   trust in these outlets remains limited. Is their politics-focused
   coverage one factor behind the limited trust? Politics-focused coverage
   highlights partisan competition, which can harm credibility by
   activating identity-protective biases or resistance to persuasive
   intent. Prior research suggests depoliticized contexts can help mitigate
   defensive psychological tendencies in news source assessments. Thus, a
   potential approach to build broad-based trust could be to broaden the
   scope of coverage to include nonpolitical topics. Through a
   preregistered survey experiment in the United States, I test how the
   topical scope of coverage affects source credibility perceptions.
   Compared to politics-focused coverage, science-focused coverage improves
   credibility assessments. Focusing solely or partially on popular culture
   topics such as entertainment, sports, and lifestyle reduces source
   credibility. The effects of nonpolitical coverage on source credibility
   perceptions are similar across partisan groups. The results suggest the
   public shares the notion that serious public affairs coverage is central
   to reputable journalism. Overall, coverage of politics and science fares
   relatively well in building source credibility, whereas coverage of
   popular culture undermines credibility assessments. People find news
   sources that correct misinformation more credible when they cover a
   range of serious topics, but less credible when they cover lighter
   topics.},

Abstract = {The opening of Spain's first railway in 1848 inaugurated a short-lived
   period of railway euphoria that consumed the imaginations of Spaniards
   and resulted in the rapid development of nearly 5000 km of track. While
   most historians of Spain's nineteenth century concede that the effort
   failed to trigger the industrialization many had hoped for, it did
   stimulate the minds of those primed to fantasize about the Spanish
   future then being constructed with iron and steam. Fueling these dreams
   of a hyper-modernized future was the dark specter of Spanish decline, a
   narrative with roots in the seventeenth century and an influential
   cultural force in the nineteenth. Nineteenth-century railway boosters
   and journalists frequently conjured up stirring images of a prostrate
   Spain being lifted out of the mire of decline and re-joining the nations
   of Europe. This article explores how popular anticipation at the
   prospect of railways prompted an infectious feeling of possibility that
   echoed across Spain and promised, if only for a bright and fleeting
   moment, to ease Spanish insecurities and allow the nation to finally
   free itself of the terrible burden of its past failures.},

Abstract = {Mexico has experienced a notable surge in assassinations of political
   candidates and mayors. This article that these killings are largely
   driven by organized crime, aiming to influence candidate selection,
   control governments for rent-seeking, and retaliate against government
   crackdowns. Using a new dataset of assassinations in Mexico from 2000 to
   2021 and instrumental variables, we address endogeneity concerns
   location and timing of government crackdowns. Our instruments include
   historical Chinese immigration linked to opium cultivation in Mexico,
   local corn prices, and U.S. illicit drug prices. The findings reveal
   candidates in municipalities near oil pipelines face an increased risk
   of assassination due to drug trafficking organizations expanding into
   oil theft, particularly during elections and fuel price hikes.
   Government arrests killings of organized crime members trigger
   retaliatory violence, further endangering incumbent mayors. political
   violence has a negligible impact on voter turnout, as it targets
   politicians rather than voters. However, voter turnout increases in
   areas where authorities disrupt drug smuggling, raising the chances of
   the local being re-elected. These results offer new insights into how
   criminal groups attempt to capture local governments and the
   implications for democracy under criminal governance.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates the effects of non-trade non-rent barriers to
   intra-Africa trade. Specifically, the effects of improved productivity,
   improved capital inflows, share of employment in non-agricultural
   sectors, and ratio of rural population. We seek to investigate the
   impact of institutional strength measured by property rights, rule of
   law and control of corruption, different exchange rate regimes on the
   impact of the non-trade non-rent variables on intra-Africa trade. We use
   an extensive dataset of 25 countries, by picking the most diverse and
   high-income economies in each region, for the period 2000-2020 using
   annual data. The empirical analysis involves a linear panel analysis
   with a fixed effects estimator. The study provides evidence that level
   of labor productivity is a key factor in the growth of intra-Africa
   imports and exports, the share of employment in the wholesale and
   services sector also has a significantly positive impact, exchange rate
   regimes play a magnifying role, and strong institutions (regulatory
   quality, rule of law and low corruption) will enhance the benefits to be
   drawn for increased income flows.},

Abstract = {We study contests for promotion of local government leaders orchestrated
   by the central government in China. The contests rewarded regional
   economic success. The probability of promotion increased with regional
   infrastructure investment but we find negative returns from
   infrastructure. We find feedback between corruption and investment in
   infrastructure. There was moral hazard - successful local government
   leaders who were promoted to higher level positions in the government
   and Party hierarchical structure left behind regional local governments
   mired in debt or bankruptcy because of debt financing of infrastructure
   investment that was used to win the center-orchestrated contests. Our
   study makes a contribution to contest theory by providing an empirical
   study for rent-seeking contests.},

Abstract = {Concurrent sourcing in public services arise when identical (or almost
   identical) transactions are simultaneously produced in-house and
   contracted out by a same public entity. Based on recent theoretical
   developments, this paper proposes an empirical investigation of
   concurrent sourcing in the waste collection sector in France, analyzing
   both the ex ante motivations (why concurrent sourcing?) and the ex post
   consequences (what impact on performance?) of such choices by public
   authorities. Our findings suggest that the choice of concurrent sourcing
   is mainly based on economic efficiency considerations (scale economies
   and management of service complexity) without being immune to political
   considerations. Our results on the ex post consequences of this choice
   highlight a non-linear effect of this strategy on costs, and shows that
   the use of concurrent sourcing is an effective way for public
   authorities to discipline private partners beyond a certain threshold of
   activity volume.},

Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {201},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {1-20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A school of economic historians argues that the medieval church was an
   economic firm: not metaphorically, but literally. Their work has been
   virtually ignored by professional medieval historians, but it has been
   published by Oxford University Press and the University of Chicago
   Press, so it does deserve attention. Conversely, it would be healthy for
   economists and public choice scholars to get reactions from a historian.
   There appears to have been a wall between the two disciplines, an
   unhealthy situation. The economists discussed here see the medieval
   Church as a ``multi-divisional firm{''}, ``characterized by a central
   office {[}the papacy] that controls overall financial allocations and
   conducts strategic, long-range planning, but allows divisions (usually
   regional) a high degree of autonomy in day-to-day operations{''} (ST
   1996: 20). In fact, the medieval church was a multitude of discrete
   systems within a common legal framework. It was certainly not an
   ``economic firm{''}.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how exposure to critical social media content
   influences political engagement in authoritarian regimes, focusing on
   Kazakhstan. Addressing a gap in existing research, this paper examines
   the moderating role of state media fairness perceptions. Using
   representative survey data (N = 6,800), the analyses confirm that
   critical social media exposure is positively linked with political
   engagement, including state-sanctioned activities like party contact and
   legislative engagement. However, this effect varies significantly based
   on individuals' perceptions of state media fairness. These results
   suggest that critical content can foster broader political participation
   and highlight the nuanced role of state media in shaping political
   behavior in closed states.},

Abstract = {In this study, we contribute to the research field concerning early
   voting by examining the rejection of early votes in the general election
   in Sweden in 2022. The results show that the rejection rate of early
   votes in Sweden is high, which is of course problematic because eligible
   voters who vote should not have their ballots rejected because of
   errors. Contrary to our theoretical expectations, we did not find any
   patterns in the level of rejected early votes among the municipalities.
   We also examine why early votes are rejected, and the findings
   demonstrate that errors of different kinds occur, though some are more
   common than others, for example, putting more than one ballot paper in a
   ballot envelope seems to be a common problem. Finally, we provide
   several recommendations for the Election Authority concerning how the
   level of rejection of early votes can be reduced in Sweden},

Abstract = {Recent agenda-setting studies have increasingly replaced survey data
   with readily available, nonreactive data that at first glance might
   serve as indicators of the public agenda to the same extent: the amount
   of online search queries regarding an issue and the volume of donations
   for non-profit organizations that are collecting money for problem
   solving related to an issue. This raises the question of whether the
   results of agenda-setting studies depend on which of these indicators is
   used to measure the public agenda. In this study, we compare the
   agenda-setting effect of media coverage of migration on the public
   salience of this issue in Germany between 2015 and 2020 as measured by
   three different indicators of the public agenda on a monthly basis:
   survey data, Google Trends data, and fundraising data. Our analyses show
   significant simultaneous correlations between the media agenda and all
   three indicators of the public agenda, with a smaller influence of the
   media agenda on fundraising data than in the other two cases. However,
   when Granger causality is used to identify causal relationships, a
   positive influence of the media agenda on the public agenda is only
   found when the public agenda is measured with survey data.},

Abstract = {This article illustrates the critical intersection between cultural
   diversity, armed conflicts, and transitional justice efforts in Northern
   Cauca. Despite facing persistent challenges from armed conflict and
   resource exploitation, ethnic communities have demonstrated remarkable
   resilience, adapting legal and organizational strategies to advocate for
   their rights and preserve their rich cultural heritage. This study
   contributes to the academic understanding of these complex phenomena and
   highlights the need for more integrated and culturally sensitive
   approaches in policymaking and peace and justice practices.
   Methodologically, publications from legal anthropologists, sociologists,
   and lawyers were reviewed, complemented with field experiences and a
   critical analysis of the data. The historicocritical perspective in a
   region of rich biodiversity is emphasized, examining the potential
   transformations of the conflict and transitional justice.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveWe propose a simple approach to dealing with partial
   contestation in models of multiparty elections.MethodsOur proposed
   approach is to add a tiny value to the vote share of parties that do not
   contest a district and then to include dummy variables identifying those
   districts in which parties do not compete. We can then estimate a single
   system of equations using a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR)
   approach and Aitchison's log-ratio transformation. In our SUR system, we
   interact the dummy variable for a party that partially contested
   districts with other predictors in the equation that uses the share of
   votes of the same party in the log-ratio outcome. Finally, we estimate
   robust standard errors for predictors in this equation to address
   heteroscedasticity.ResultsWe demonstrate the utility of our approach
   using simulated data and election results from the English parliamentary
   elections in 2017.ConclusionFrom our simulations, we find that our
   recommended approach performs as well as that proposed by Tom, Tucker,
   and Wittenberg. Our strategy is advantageous in that it is easy to
   estimate, uses information from all districts, and addresses partial
   contestation in real-world elections with a single system of seemingly
   unrelated regressions.},

Abstract = {IntroductionSystemic racism theory has become a central part of academic
   and public discussions about criminal justice institutions and reforms.
   Little, however, is known about the association between people's belief
   in the ubiquity of systemic racism and their attitudes toward criminal
   justice institutions and reforms.MethodsTo fill this gap, we examine the
   association between systemic racism beliefs and support for police,
   police reform, and the BLM movement using a national YouGov sample of
   1125 U.S. adults.ResultsSystemic racism beliefs are associated with
   Americans' attitudes toward all three outcomes, net of a wide range of
   controls, including negative experiences with police, political
   ideology, and most notably, racial resentment.ConclusionOur study
   provides compelling evidence that belief in systemic racism is an
   important driver of Americans' support for police, police reforms, and
   BLM.},

Title = {Is socially responsible capitalism truly polarizing?},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {105},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1368-1382},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objective: We assess the hypothesis that socially responsible capitalism
   (SRC) is fundamentally partisan and primarily supported by people on the
   left, or whether this perception is another example of ``false
   polarization{''}-overestimation of disagreement between the left and
   right. Methods: We conduct two studies: (1) a survey of Americans'
   opinions on a general definition of SRC and five examples of recent
   prominent firm actions corresponding to distinct areas of SRC (n = 1000,
   representative sample) and (2) an incentivized survey on second-order
   beliefs about results from the first survey (n = 605, quota-matched
   convenience sample). We conduct statistical tests of the accuracy of
   second-order beliefs about polarization between Democrats and
   Republicans in support for SRC and correlates of this accuracy. Results:
   Large majorities of Democrats and Republicans support examples of
   corporate behavior from three of the five areas of SRC, but opinions are
   somewhat divided across the parties on support for SRC as a concept, and
   highly divided for the SRC examples on diversity, equity, and inclusion
   (DEI) and climate change. Both Democrats and Republicans generally
   underestimate SRC support from partisans on both sides except for DEI,
   which both parties overestimate support for. SRC support is especially
   underestimated by people opposed to SRC and people with no opinion on
   SRC. Democrats overestimate polarization in support for SRC.
   Overestimation of polarization in SRC support is correlated with
   affective polarization. Conclusion: Bipartisan support for SRC is
   underappreciated, but some aspects of SRC are polarizing or even more
   polarizing than commonly perceived. Republican opposition to SRC may be
   partially due to underestimation of copartisan support for SRC. A focus
   in the news and popular discourse on the more polarizing aspects of SRC
   may contribute to a general perception that support for SRC is more
   polarized than it truly is.},

Abstract = {Long waiting lines at polling stations have been a persistent issue on
   election days, often worsened by inadequate planning at consolidated
   polling locations. This paper reviews seven scientific methods from the
   literature that determine the minimum required voting resources at
   polling stations, analyzing their methodologies, key assumptions,
   practicality, and limitations. It also demonstrates that applying these
   methods could have prevented the excessive waiting times observed during
   the 2016 presidential primary election in Arizona.
   Queueing-formula-based methods are favored in data-limited scenarios due
   to their rigor, transparency, and reasonable approximation of real
   voting queues, while simulation-based methods can provide more precise
   queue performance estimates when sufficient data is available. Enhanced
   communication and training are needed to encourage election officials to
   adopt these methods.},

Title = {The geography of Hispanic political behavior in Texas, 2012-2022},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},

Volume = {105},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1092-1106},

Abstract = {ObjectiveWe make use of multiple data sources to examine whether there
   has been geographical polarization in the political behavior of Texas
   Hispanics from 2012 to 2022. It is widely known that partisan divisions
   in the American electorate continue to cleave along geographic lines.
   However, much of this literature on the urban-rural divide does not
   focus on a specific racial group, and if it does, then it typically
   highlights differences among non-Hispanic white voters
   (Anglos).MethodsMaking use of aggregate- and individual-level data, we
   assess Texas Hispanics' party affiliation, participation, and vote
   choice according to geographic location.ResultsWe find notable evidence
   of geographic-based partisan polarization among Texas' burgeoning
   Hispanic population.ConclusionsAlthough the movement of rural/small town
   Texas Hispanics toward the Republican Party from 2012 to 2022 pales in
   comparison to this shift among Texas Anglos, a similar partisan dynamic
   manifests among the former group. We abstain from using the word
   realignment to characterize these changes in Texas Hispanics' political
   behavior according to geographic location, but, nevertheless, it is
   clear that the Democratic Party's hold on this potentially pivotal group
   in the Lone Star State's electorate has loosened, and especially among
   rural/small town Latinos since the rise of Donald Trump.},

   significance of the administrative realm as a site of politics,

Abstract = {The Whitlam Government has an enduring legacy. Yet scholarship on the
   Whitlam Government rarely exclusively or extensively focusses on its
   disability policies. This article applies disability studies to analyse
   key policies of the Whitlam Government, including increases to the
   Invalid Pension, Sheltered Employment Allowance and Sickness Benefits,
   the Australian Assistance Plan, the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act
   1974, and the National Compensation Bill 1974 to understand how the
   Whitlam Government understood people with disability and the ongoing
   legacy of the policies. It hypothesises that, although from a
   contemporary viewpoint the policies and how they understand people with
   disability could be problematised, it postulates that, in the 1970s,
   they reflect a significant shift in how people with disability were
   understood and governed. Further, it conjects that the policies can
   inform current disability policy.},

Abstract = {Prior research has delved into the diverse effects that social media
   news consumption has over broader social media interaction patterns.
   From social ties curation, to ties filtering, blocking, and other
   behaviors, social media news consumption has been empirically deemed to
   influence the way citizens socialize in these virtual spaces. Drawing on
   a diverse and nationally representative two wave-panel data from Spain,
   this study builds on this strand of the literature by investigating the
   role of social media news, social media culture of impunity and social
   media envy or feelings of jealousy, and resentment toward others, over
   trolling and insulting people in social media. Results show that social
   media news has a direct association with malicious trolling but does not
   fuel abusive verbal interactions. The latter is mainly explained by
   individuals who embrace a culture of impunity - the expectation that in
   social media one may commit a crime or violation and not be held
   accountable-, and social media envy. Furthermore, there is a positive
   divergent interaction between social media envy and culture of impunity
   on insulting other citizens. That is, people who report higher levels of
   social media envy and culture of impunity tend to engage in insulting
   others the most in social media.},

Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, some groups and individuals rearticulated
   state power through conspiracy theories. Despite their fringe status,
   conspiracy theory beliefs can directly animate citizen's engagements
   with institutions. Drawing on Barkun's `conventional' and `stigmatised'
   knowledge types, we analyse the appearance of conspiracism in citizen
   e-petitions, and their rebuttal by government ministries. Our data are
   e-petitions submitted to the House of Representatives in the Parliament
   of Australia between 2020 and 2021. Petitions and responses are
   snapshots of pandemic governance in motion: unfolding through contested
   interpretations of a diverse range of subjects including virology,
   immunisation and border security. The novel characteristics of
   conspiracist petitions allow theories to persist, irrespective of their
   place in wider society: they appropriate e-petition system affordances,
   compete directly with institutions and officials, reframe events to
   maintain narratives over time, and serve as entrepreneurial activity for
   individual conspiracists. E-petitions remain an essential democratic
   forum between citizens and federal parliament but represent challenges
   for policymaking and government communication in uncertain times.},

Abstract = {This article examines the campaign strategy known as ``redboxing.{''}
   Redboxing refers to efforts by candidates and parties to bypass laws
   prohibiting them from coordinating campaign advertising with outside
   spending groups such as super PACs. This coordination takes place in
   plain sight-on official campaign websites and party
   ``microsites{''}-with campaigns asking outside groups to fund specific
   campaign messages that target particular groups of voters on desired
   media channels. The instructions contained in a redbox typically employ
   coded or technical language intended to guide the resulting
   ``independent{''} expenditures, and are often presented in a
   distinctive, red-bordered text box designed to be easily identifiable by
   super PAC operatives. Overall, we find that campaigns use redboxing for
   two purposes: to engage an allied outside group to amplify the
   campaign's primary message to voters, or to delegate a given message to
   an allied group, often a negative or inflammatory attack on a political
   opponent. Complementing our legal analysis of this practice, we assess
   the prevalence of redboxing in the American political system, as well as
   the relationship between redboxing and independent expenditures in
   congressional races. Drawing on the first comprehensive dataset of
   redboxes in a single electoral cycle, we find that this strategy is far
   more widespread than previously understood. Over two hundred candidates
   for federal office employed redboxing during the 2022 electoral cycle,
   and these same candidates frequently benefitted from super PAC spending
   that was hundreds of times greater than candidates who did not redbox.
   We conclude by providing recommendations for legal reforms to bring
   redboxing under control, highlighting recent reform initiatives adopted
   in Philadelphia and Allegheny County, PA, to outline a workable rule
   that prohibits redboxing while not infringing on genuine, vital
   political speech.},

Abstract = {Do Americans see veterans as particularly deserving or simply as other
   members of their community? From a nationally representative survey
   fielded between June and September 2021 with over 2,000 respondents, we
   find that Americans state high levels of support for veterans and are
   willing to pay additional tax dollars to provide assistance programs. We
   find that most Americans support free health care, free college, and
   affordable housing for all Americans, and the support is notably
   stronger for programs for veterans. From a discrete choice experiment,
   we find that Americans are willing to pay hundreds of dollars in
   additional taxes to provide assistance programs to either veterans or to
   all community members, and Americans are willing to pay significantly
   more for certain programs for veterans. In addition, we look at
   differences in willingness to pay based on military and political
   affiliation and find significant differences in willingness to pay by
   political affiliation.},

Abstract = {Visual disinformation has been regarded as convincing because it
   strongly resembles reality. Yet, we lack a clear understanding of the
   effects of different forms of audiovisual disinformation-cheapfakes
   versus deepfakes. To advance the disinformation literature, this paper
   reports on the findings of two experiments in which participants were
   exposed to political cheapfakes and deepfakes, respectively. Our main
   findings indicate that audiovisual disinformation is not perceived as
   more credible or believable than the same disinformation in textual
   format. Importantly, deepfakes are perceived as less credible than
   cheapfakes with a similar de-legitimizing anti-immigration narrative.
   Although more research is needed, our findings suggest that less
   sophisticated modes of deception can be at least as credible as more
   sophisticated forms of artificial intelligence-driven audiovisual
   fabrication.},

Title = {Polarization All the Way Down: How Coverage of Elite and Partisan
   Polarization Spills Over to Perceptions of the US Mass Public},

Abstract = {How do ordinary citizens perceive and respond to different kinds of
   political polarization in the U.S.? Recent work shows that people
   believe that the parties are intensely polarized but, in reality, the
   extent of polarization depends on whether we focus on political elites
   or the mass public. This paper reports results from two survey
   experiments with samples from Dynata and CloudResearch (total N = 2,940)
   exploring how people perceive ideological and affective polarization
   among (a) party elites, (b) partisan voters, and (c) ordinary Americans
   in the mass public. I show that participants believe that the public is
   both ideologically and affectively polarized, only marginally less than
   partisans and elites. I also find some evidence that news media creates
   perceptual spillover between elites, partisans, and the mass public:
   participants given information about (non)polarization for only one
   group nonetheless update their perceptions of all three groups in
   parallel. Given the dominance of information about elites and elite
   polarization in the U.S. media environment, I argue that top-down
   spillover from news stories about elites may help to explain why people
   think the public is more polarized than it really is.},

Title = {The road (not) taken: The contingencies of infrastructure and
   sovereignty in the Horn of Africa},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {110},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article offers a longitudinal study of the complex entanglements
   between infrastructure and sovereignty in the Horn of Africa. By
   analysing Ethiopia's imperial transport corridors, the political economy
   of Djibouti's Red Sea ports, and the Greater Nile Oil Pipeline between
   South Sudan, Khartoum, and global markets, we underline the co
   -production of infrastructure and sovereignty as a defining feature of
   regional politics in the last 150 years. In a region notorious for the
   redrawing of borders, continuous violent conflict, and contested
   sovereignties, we emphasize the contingency of this relationship by
   making two central arguments. First, infrastructures have been central
   to the exercise of sovereignty and the consolidation of political orders
   in the region; dams, pipelines and ports have spearheaded efforts to
   hardwire centralizing political institutions, extractive commercial
   relations, and centripetal sentiments of belonging. Second, in doing so
   these infrastructures have sought to disable infrastructural
   alternatives because rival infrastructural visions embody competing
   claims of sovereignty. However, as state -building projects and the
   infrastructures they prioritize have often failed to successfully
   neutralise opposing articulations of political authority and belonging,
   we argue that the vulnerability of existing infrastructures contributes
   to the vulnerability of political order in the Horn. This article draws
   attention to the roads not taken and how those could have changed -and
   might still reconfigure -the politics of the region.},

Title = {Does the pattern of ICT possession exacerbate inequality in educational
   opportunities between students with and without disabilities? Evidence
   from Egypt},
Journal = {REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to analyze to what extent distance education is
   feasible and efficient with the limited technological infrastructure in
   Egypt. The study answers this question from the perspective of
   households' preparedness level regarding possessing information and
   communication technologies (ICTs). In addition, it assesses whether the
   pattern of students' ICT ownership is influenced by disability- and
   socioeconomic-based inequality in education and whether the pattern of
   ICT ownership exacerbates such biases.Design/methodology/approachA
   three-stage probit model with double sample selection (PMDSS) was
   applied to estimate the factors likely to influence ICT possession,
   considering the selection process for school enrollment and education
   continuation. The authors utilized nationally representative data from
   the Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey 2018.FindingsAbout 40\% of students
   aged 12-25 did not have ICTs. Most socioeconomically poor households,
   particularly those living in Upper Egypt, were the least likely to
   obtain ICTs and rely on distance education. In addition, female
   students, particularly those with disabilities, had the lowest chance of
   benefitting from distance learning.Research limitations/implicationsThe
   persistent structural deprivation of school enrollment and educational
   progression has led to the positive selection of well-off children in
   education, which is extended to ICT possession and internet use. Without
   addressing these structural biases, the study suggests that distance
   education will likely exacerbate educational
   inequalities.Originality/valueThe study analyzed the extent to which
   Egyptian families were prepared in 2018 regarding ICT possessions for
   distance education for their children, particularly those with
   disabilities. Furthermore, it investigated whether access to distance
   learning was influenced by disability- and socioeconomic-based
   inequalities in education.},

Abstract = {This study uses recently declassified documents to analyse the Fraser
   government's human rights policy towards South Korea. It demonstrates
   that when the Fraser government made its first human rights
   representation to the South Korean government in August 1976, it was
   under limited public pressure to do so, and human rights issues were of
   limited importance in the bilateral relationship. By late 1980, however,
   when political opposition figure Kim Dae Jung was sentenced to death,
   human rights considerations dominated Australian foreign policy towards
   South Korea, and public pressure on the Fraser government to try and
   prevent Kim's execution was substantial. The Fraser government's policy
   response to Kim's case was in part a reaction to public pressure, human
   rights considerations were also involved, but perhaps the most
   substantial factor driving the government's policy response was that
   Kim's execution was sure to sour the bilateral relationship and
   jeopardise the economic relationship. Overall, South Korea was a place
   where the Fraser government grappled with key questions about how to
   pursue human rights in foreign policy and where it had to address a
   human rights issue that had the capacity to seriously disrupt bilateral
   relations.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveI examined whether retrospective evaluations of local
   governments were influenced by perceptions of local governments'
   influence.MethodsI fielded a survey (n = 1000) that asked respondents
   about their local governments, their perceptions of the economy and
   crime, and the influence of local governments on the economy and
   crime.ResultsI found that respondents who strongly agreed with a
   statement that local governments had important economic consequences
   were more likely to connect their perceptions of the local economy to
   their evaluations of their local government than those who only somewhat
   agreed, or neither agreed nor disagreed with that statement. I found
   that respondents who strongly agreed with a statement that local
   governments could reduce violent crime were more likely to connect their
   perception of local crime to their evaluation of their local government
   than those who neither agreed nor disagreed with that
   statement.ConclusionI found some evidence that retrospective evaluations
   are moderated by perceptions of local government influence.},

Abstract = {The article addresses a two-fold question: first, why does the French
   state invest so much time and resources in its Indian Ocean islands,
   Mayotte and Reunion? And why do these ultra-marine regions remain wedded
   to the French Republic? The high degree of insular buy-in both regions
   involves a two-level game, connecting state and island actors. Such
   turning to mainland France represents a form of African agency, however
   dependent on the mainland these islands appear to be. The causal
   mechanisms of the integration of the French Indian Ocean territories
   combine historical legacy (choosing France), institutional evolution
   (departmentalisation), common economic and military security challenges,
   the cost calculus of mainland France's readiness to govern ultramarine
   territories and a widely shared set of beliefs in the value of remaining
   French. The islands are acting like rational actors, whose insular and
   isolated status pushes in the direction of seeking protection in an
   unstable environment.},

Abstract = {Under conditions of high social and political polarization, expressing
   political anger online toward systemic injustice faces an apparent
   trilemma: Express none but lose anger's valuable goods; express anger to
   heterogeneous audiences but risk aggravating inter-group polarization;
   or express anger to like-minded people but succumb to the epistemic
   pitfalls and extremist tendencies inherent to homogeneous groups.
   Solving the trilemma requires cultivating an online environment as a
   deliberative system composed of four kinds of groups-each with distinct
   purposes and norms. I argue that applying empirically-guided design
   principles to this systems framework provides political anger a place
   where its powers can serve justice without damaging the epistemic,
   ethical, emotional, and community resources required for a democratic
   path to correcting systemic injustice.},

Title = {Forging New Instruments of Mass Social Control from Traditional
   Materials: The Disciplinary Role of Catholic Church Personnel in
   Franco's State Prison System of the 1940s and 1950s},
Journal = {EUROPEAN HISTORY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {33-52},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Francoism's repression of its civilian population was based on a
   massified prison system and parallel system of punitive parole. At their
   core were religious personnel who fulfilled key disciplinary functions
   for the new state. By the latter stages of the civil war (1936-1939),
   church and lay Catholic personnel had already produced the legal
   justifications to underpin the repression. They blended older
   quasi-theocratic and anti-egalitarian philosophy to meet the
   disciplinary needs of the new moment where a politically mobilized
   society was challenging older forms of traditional order and hierarchy
   (before and during the war). This church-state symbiosis in Spain was
   already explicit by the early-twentieth century. After World War Two, as
   before it, Franco's `National-Catholic' dictatorship deployed religious
   personnel speaking an antiquated language of `re-Christianization' and
   `religious conversion' to impose a modern, state disciplinary project -
   i.e., the sculpting and close surveillance of its population. Given the
   Church's full participation in this `divine totalitarianism', it was
   paradoxical that by the time of Cold War ascendancy in the mid-1950s, it
   would be the same Church providing an alibi for Franco's state - in
   which judicial and penal systems remained militarized, and the everyday
   lives of its population closely controlled - to reassure Western
   interlocutors, who were themselves mostly socially conservative and/or
   Christian-Democratic, of Francoism's `non-totalitarian' nature.},

Title = {How opposition parties politicize democracy during autocratization},
Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {34-58},
Abstract = {How do democratic actors rhetorically politicize their own
   disempowerment? Autocratization as a gradual process not only erodes
   democracy, but also progressively reduces the power of domestic actors
   to oppose this erosion. Often, incumbent governments disable the
   institutions meant to hold them accountable, such as parliaments.
   Drawing on the case of Hungary, we study how (opposition) parties
   rhetorically politicize democracy within the institution of parliament.
   As a case of rapid autocratization, Hungary saw far-reaching changes,
   including the transformation or abolition of many democratic
   institutions over the past years. New laws also restricted the rights of
   parliament itself, thereby narrowing the opportunities for public debate
   around democratic procedures. We address two questions related to this:
   To which extent do opposition parties politicize democracy and its
   procedures in a context of autocratization? And how does the way they
   talk about democracy differ from that of the government? The paper uses
   text-as-data methods - namely a dictionary of democratic principles and
   a word-embedding-based analysis of democracy rhetoric - to study
   parliamentary debates between 2010 and 2022. We find that democracy is
   highly salient for both the government and the opposition, however,
   their understanding of democracy differs in substance.},

Abstract = {This article offers an interpretation focused on the impact of the
   Republican deserters on the socialization of the insurgent combatants
   and the subsequent acceptance of Franco's dictatorship. Unlike the
   Nation -States, not all deserters were sent to prison or concentration
   camps; those without blood crimes were sent to the front. The contact
   between the forced recruits of the insurgent side and the escapees may
   have influenced their perception of the conflict, as they discovered
   that the realities on both sides of the trenches did not differ
   significantly. Through the theory of << opinion leaders >>, deserters,
   in a seemingly << banal >> manner, were able to impact the heterogeneous
   insurgent troops with their experiences. This study uses the
   documentation obtained from the insurgent information service,
   specifically the interrogations, considering the limitations of this
   source. The text attempts to provide another view of the consolidation
   of the dictatorship.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {72},
Number = {4},
Pages = {702-726},
Abstract = {Over a period of more than three decades from 1982 to 2019, this study
   examines the impact of financial globalization on financial development,
   taking into account differences between developed and developing
   countries. It also examines sub-indices of financial-development and
   provides a comprehensive perspective on the topic. The analyses in this
   study use the Durbin- Hausman panel cointegration test, which provides
   more precise and less biased results for panel data with a large number
   of units and the augmented mean group (AMG) estimator, which combines
   the advantages of both fixed-effects and random-effects estimators to
   provide more efficient and robust forecasts. Empirical findings reveal a
   long-run association between financial development and financial
   globalization across both developed and developing economies. Notably,
   while the coefficients of this relationship are consistently positive in
   both groups, statistical significance is observed only in developed
   countries. This result implies that the positive effect of financial
   globalization on financial development is more pronounced in developed
   countries. It also points to the importance of market participants in
   developed and developing countries making financial decisions in line
   with their countries' level of development.},

Abstract = {This article explores how Belarusian political actors, speaking from
   diverse civilisa- tional perspectives, discuss the place of older
   citizens, particularly less privileged women, in society. It
   demonstrates how the persistent logic of Cold War geopolitics animates
   social hierarchies in territories positioned between Western and Russian
   in- fluences. Through an analysis of state-controlled and opposition
   media, I find that the official national project and the ethnocentric
   concept of Belarusianness share a discur- sive construction of
   `pensioners' as an inferior Other. Invested in confrontation with the
   West, the autocratic regime claims moral superiority by representing
   `pensioners' as objects of state care. Drawing on the narrative of
   suffering under communism/Rus- sian colonialism, advocates of a
   `European' Belarus discuss older people as obstacles to democracy. By
   exploring the narrative of `in-between-ness', which champions a demo-
   cratic Belarus that belongs neither to the Soviet past/Russia nor to the
   West but is con- nected to both, I argue that rejecting binary logic in
   national self-determination opens up opportunities for intergroup
   solidarity.},

Title = {Leaving Home and Living Abroad: A Comparative Analysis of the Factors
   Influencing the Migration Decisions of Africans to Move Abroad},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {106},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objective:This study comparatively examined the individual- and
   country-level factors influencing migration decisions of Africans using
   large-scale cross-sectional data from 34 African
   countries.Methods:Employing a multilevel analysis technique,
   specifically hierarchical linear modeling (HML), this study addresses
   design, methodological, and analytical limitations in the existing
   literature.Results:At the individual level, gender, age, education,
   foreign exposure, sense of nationality, fear of violence,
   discrimination, economic management, and income and salary issues
   significantly predicted migration decisions. Male citizens, those with
   post-secondary education, urban residents, individuals with a strong
   sense of nationality, and those fearful of extremism were more likely to
   consider relocation. Citizens who experienced religious and disability
   discrimination and those who believed that economic management and
   salary/income were major problems were also more inclined to migrate.
   Conversely, citizens aged 66 years or older and those who were fearful
   of violence were less likely to relocate. At the country level, gross
   domestic product (GDP) and regional location were important factors,
   with citizens from countries with higher GDPs and those located in
   southern Africa being less likely to consider migration.Conclusion:The
   findings contribute to theory building on African migration and provide
   insights for developing policies to address the challenges posed by
   international migration, particularly in western Africa. This study
   recommends a comprehensive approach to economic management, investment
   in education and vocational training, anti-discrimination measures, and
   targeted strategies for high-migration regions.},

Title = {Interpreting title IX: A feminist legal geography of sexual assault
   prevention on US college campuses},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {116},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article uses questions and tools from feminist legal geography to
   explore the uneven institutional and discursive landscapes of sexual
   assault prevention on U.S. college campuses under the auspices of Title
   IX. College campuses in the United States remain landscapes of risk and
   fear, felt most strongly by women and nonbinary students, despite
   decades of campus interventions to prevent assault, support survivors,
   and hold perpetrators accountable. Passed in 1972, Title IX represents
   the most important federal legislation addressing gender discrimination
   on campus, one that has evolved over several decades at the intersection
   of litigation, administrative rule-making, and feminist activism to
   broaden the scope of what ``gender discrimination{''} means. Our
   analysis highlights the variability in how universities interpret Title
   IX as it pertains to sexual assault, which can profoundly shape the
   effectiveness of prevention and support services. Some universities
   narrowly interpret Title IX, leading to ``law and order{''} approaches
   and policies that individualize the problem and side-step communal
   responsibility. Others, however, go beyond checking the box of Title IX
   by instituting comprehensive and trauma-informed narratives and services
   that tackle sexual violence as a question of power and patriarchy. While
   the tensions between these paradigms have been explored in extant
   literature, our qualitative discursive analysis represents a unique
   entry point for assessing the specific institutional contexts that can
   lead to distinct approaches.},

Title = {Toxic displacements: An environmental justice perspective on a chemical
   waste site in Denmark},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {116},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this article we examine the problem of toxic waste and its
   entanglements with environmental justice in the Anthropocene from the
   perspective of Harbo \& oslash;re Tange - the waste site of one of the
   greatest chemical pollution scandals in Danish environmental history.
   Drawing on qualitative interviews and ethnographic fieldwork, we show
   how environmental harms and inequalities are sustained over time through
   a series of `toxic displacements' that make the consequences of the
   chemical waste less seen and felt. These findings add to existing
   environmental justice theories about problem displacement by
   demonstrating how such displacements take place along both spatial,
   temporal, and cross-species dimensions.},

Title = {The Specter of the Casualty: Elite Misreading of British Public
   Perceptions of the Soldier 2001-2014},
Journal = {ARMED FORCES \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 3},
Abstract = {During military operations between 2001 and 2014, British political and
   military leaders came to believe that the public were casualty-averse
   and viewed soldiers sympathetically as victims. Recent scholarship has
   demonstrated that this interpretation of public opinion altered the way
   that British combat operations were conducted in Afghanistan. This study
   finds that this elite interpretation was inaccurate. Providing a first
   analysis of British media representations of soldiers at key moments
   throughout the whole campaign, it finds that this interpretation
   misjudged the nature of soldier victimhood. Where political and military
   elites attributed public disquiet to military casualties, this research
   finds that the public was more likely to be concerned with contextual
   factors (notably competent management) and argues that casualty-aversion
   was a symptom of this concern rather than its cause-a finding which sees
   the U.K. experience as supporting and extending U.S.-based theory.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND HISTORY},

Abstract = {The emergence in the 1990s of voluntary repatriation as a significant
   new norm in the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
   practice in refugee protection is often represented as something of an
   inevitability. Numerous scholars have suggested that the growth at UNHCR
   of a ``repatriation culture{''} throughout the 1980s was principally the
   result of the increasing pressures of mass influx events alongside the
   challenges of dwindling resources and states' demands for durable
   solutions to successive refugee crises. In this article, we argue that
   these challenges offer only a partial explanation for UNHCR's turn from
   the cold war ``exilic bias{''} of the international protection regime,
   towards the post-cold war prioritisation of repatriation. We suggest
   that states such as Australia, deeply concerned with the long-term
   outcomes of refugee flows in the late 1970s and 1980s, worked in tandem
   with key individuals who helped to shape the normative landscape of
   international protection. We identify GJL Coles as one such individual
   and offer a close analysis of his influence on key statements concerning
   voluntary repatriation throughout the 1980s. By making visible the
   entangled contributions of Australia and Coles, we add a hitherto
   missing strand to the story of how the ``repatriation culture{''} at
   UNHCR, and the human rights discourse that accompanied it, emerged.},

   thousands of protestors took to the streets in Iran-and the whole world
   watched through their screens. Several Iranian diaspora journalists
   stepped up to cover the events in Iran for western news outlets. In this
   study, we interviewed fourteen Iranian diaspora journalists on how they
   define their role when reporting on Iran and how they navigate the
   balance between their personal experience and their reporting.
   Implications for this study include journalistic expectations for
   international news coverage and the role of the diaspora journalist
   within that coverage.},

Abstract = {The relationship between economic freedom and improvements in social and
   economic outcomes is well-documented. Yet, increasing support for
   government control of voluntary exchange has arisen in the US and many
   other countries. The present study analyzed whether videos describing
   human flourishing would influence support for economic freedom. In Study
   1, a `'brain as predictor'' approach measured the neurologic responses
   of participants (N = 64) to a library of videos in order identify the
   videos most likely to influence people's attitudes. Study 2 then sent
   two videos to a representative sample of US adults (N = 1212) and
   assessed support for economic freedom compared to a no-video control
   group. The analysis first identified demographic categories that had
   statistically low support for economic freedom (Californians, those with
   low incomes, Democrats, young adults, individuals without a college
   education, people receiving substantial government support, and women)
   as targets for influence. Two different videos increased support for
   economic freedom between 5 and 10\% among Californians and among those
   receiving government aid. A feature importance analysis was used to rank
   the demographic factors affecting support for economic freedom,
   identifying those receiving government aid as the group for whom future
   messaging would have the largest impact.},

Abstract = {The article examines the challenge of balancing security restrictions
   with the need for transparent and democratic legislative functioning. It
   begins by highlighting the importance of transparency and its
   relationship with democracy and good governance. Using Ukraine as a case
   study, the article reviews the open data and other transparency measures
   employed by Ukraine's Parliament before the onset of the full-scale
   Russian aggression on February 24, 2022. It then discusses the
   limitations imposed on these measures following the declaration of
   martial law, the ensuing public debate, and subsequent modifications to
   specific transparency restrictions. Through concrete examples, the paper
   argues that a lack of transparency and the failure to balance security
   limitations with public demand for openness can undermine the
   parliament's legitimacy and constitutional authority. The article
   concludes that security measures must be proportionate and regularly
   updated to preserve the integrity of parliamentary democracy and the
   constitutional role of the parliament.},

   {[}Anonymous], 114 The tensions between China, Japan, the U.S., and England become significantly compounded when considered in combination with the socio-political events at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century. When Fenollosa visited Japan in 1896, the First Sino-Japanese War had just ended a year ago, in April 1895, which for China revealed how corrupt and ineffective the government and policies were under the Qing Dynasty. Japan, on the other hand, had displayed its superior military tactics that it adopted from the West. By order of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, the Qing Empire ceded Liaodong Peninsula, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands to Japan. The Empire also paid 200 million taels of silver to Japan for war reparations. After the war, China grew at risk of being divided and colonized by other Western powers as well as Russia, and the new imperialism that stemmed from Chinas defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War established the Open Door Policy by September 1899, only a few months after Fenollosas return to Japan earlier that February. This policy, to which the Chinese vehemently opposed, eventually contributed to the nationalism that fueled the Boxcar Rebellion in between 1899 and 1901. In addition to a number of long-term consequences of the rebellion, two worth mentioning here include: 1) the rebellion signaled the ceding of Europes interference with Chinese affairs (the Japanese would replace the European powers as the dominant power in the East; and 2) it marked a crucial shift in the U.S. presidential powers that would use military force against non-governmental organizations without Congressional authorization (President McKinley sent five thousand U.S. troops to assuage the rebellion). Japan, meanwhile, invaded Taiwan shortly after the Treaty of Shimonoseki, sustaining heavy casualties during the months between May and October in 1895. By 1915, the Qing Dynasty had been overthrown during the Wuchang Rising in Wuhan, and the Republic of China (1912-1949) had been created as the provisional government. Sun Yat-sen was announced as President, but for less than a year before Yuan Shikai, commander of the New Army and Prime Minister under the Qing Government, took his place. In 1915, Yuan declared himself emperor, and his short-lived attempt at a monarchy was upset by various rebellions, for which he abdicated his position in 1916. In Japan, the Meiji government experienced a quick transition towards an industrialized economy, and this economic stability, coupled with Japans increasing (and healthier, longer-living population), saw Japan develop into a strong democratic institution whose international power was growing by the Taisho period. The relationships between China and Japan during this period grew byzantine. In 1914, Chinas Parliament was formally dissolved, and Yuan produced a ``constitutional compact{''} that essentially replaced Chinas provisional constitution, which gave Yuan, as president, virtually unlimited powers over Chinas military, finances, foreign policy, and the rights of the Chinese citizens. Yuan would justify these reforms by stating that representative democracy had been proven inefficient by political infighting. Furthermore, Japan issued China the Twenty-One Demands on January 8, 1915, which would extend Japanese control over Manchuria, and it would give the Japanese control over the Chinese economy. The result of these demands deleteriously influenced Japans relationship not just with China (the Chinese boycotted Japanese exports, which fell by 40\%), but also with the U.S. and Britain, both of whom saw the move as a domineering approach to diplomacy. The two western countries would also reevaluate their connection to the Japanese after the demands, which retroactively affected Japans ties with Britain, especially in light that the former had signed an important military alliance with the latter earlier in the century., DOI {[}10.16059/J.CNKI.CN43-1008/C.2000.06.004, DOI 10.1596/978-1-4648-0010-8CH1].

   {[}Anonymous], 38 The co-deployment of multiple critical terms with variegated genealogies in this paragraph builds upon the theoretical apparatus that underlies and motivates this dissertation. My use of ``hail{''} is rooted primarily in Louis Althusser's formulation of ``interpellation{''} as the moment one recognizes oneself as a product of ideology in On the Reproduction of Capitalism: Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (London; New York: Verso, 2014), 190-196. However, unlike Althusser, who framed power as a negative operation performed upon the subject by agents of ``ISAs,{''} rather than both a negative and positive operation that produced new sorts of subjects, my usage of ``hail{''} is also more simply meant to denote an act of recognition by an actor in a particular mode of address or object (such as a diagram). Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe name the act of intentionally calling out to others in the mode that ONC does in its vision papers and calls for public comment an ``articulation.{''} See, Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics, 2nd ed (London; New York: Verso, 2001). When one recognizes themselves in a specific mode of address they are hailed - and acts of hailing impart ideologies, create subjects, bring out new constituencies, create new publics, form new polities, enact new stakeholders, and assist in materializing new realities. This is as true in health IT policy as in any other field of activity. This approach is also informed by Michael Warner's work, particularly in the opening pages of Publics and Counterpublics, where he writes that ``Publics...have become an almost natural feature of the social landscape, like pavement...Your attention is everywhere solicited by artifacts that say, before they say anything else, Hello, public!{''} (New York, NY: Zone Books, 2002), 7. This is the sort of hailing that ONC's diagram is doing, to an in-principle-limitless range of actors, whom the office (and I) call ``stakeholders.{''} My use of ``materialize{''} drawn chiefly from Michelle Murphy, who writes in Sick Building Syndrome and the Problem of Uncertainty, on the materialization of physical objects and objects of knowledge, that It is not so easy to materialize a new object...At stake in writing a history of the contested reality of chemical exposures is the historicity of what counts as real, of what did and did not matter. To do this, I have conveyed matter, not in terms of a prior thingness but rather in terms of the processes of history, concrete social and technical arrangements and the effects of power - hence my use of the verb materialize. (15) ONC's diagram works to materialize new knowledge-objects in the way that Murphy describes: tracing the ``concrete social and technical arrangements of power{''} so that actors can imagine new ones in a transformed health IT ecosystem. My definition of ``reality{''} comes from an assemblage of actor-network theorists such as Murphy, Annemarie Mol, Bruno Latour, and John Law. However, I am chiefly informed by John Law's approach in essays such as After Method, ``Notes on the Theory of the Actor-Network: Ordering, Strategy, and Heterogeneity,{''} and ``Seeing Like a Survey.{''} Reality is simply what actors, working together in networks, bring about and sustain: it is what they enact and materialize. See also, Boellstorff, ``For Whom the Ontology Turns.{''} As Law notes in After Method, these realities are vaguely constituted, are constantly changing and in flux. When technologies are involved, they need recalibration or what Andrew Pickering calls ``'tuning' in the sense of tuning a radio set or car engine...No one knows in advance the shape of future machines and what they will do, but we can track the process of establishing that shape,{''} by following the actions of both human and non-human actors in the network. See, John Law, ``Notes on the Theory of the Actor-Network: Ordering, Strategy, and Heterogeneity,{''} Systems Practice 5, no. 4 (April 10, 1992): 379-93; John Law, ``Seeing Like a Survey,{''} Cultural Sociology 3, no. 2 (July 1, 2009): 239-56; Andrew Pickering, The Mangle of Practice: Time, Agency, and Science (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1995),14-15. ONC's ecosystem envisions chaotic realities like these, that require constant tweaking, tuning, and tinkering: both in policy and local environments where technologies are used. Describing messy realities requires messy - if also exacting - theorization: theory that, along with the realities toward which it is aimed, also produces new realities..

Abstract = {This article presents the critique of cybernetics as central to the
   history of one of the twentieth century's most infamous avant-garde
   movements: the Situationist International (SI). Bringing together and
   analysing a series of seemingly marginal events in the build-up to May
   `68, this article shows how the SI's portrait of cybernetics as an
   emerging form of social power and control foreshadows later developments
   in French radical thought. This little-noted trajectory in the
   situationist movement also highlights the ways in which aesthetics,
   theory, and politics are inextricably tied together in the events of May

Abstract = {We preregistered and experimentally tested six hypotheses assessing AI
   chatbot effects on political learning. We randomly assigned subjects to
   the AI chatbot ChatGPT, Google Search, or a control group with no
   stimulus or outside assistance in two nationally representative survey
   experiments on U.S. crime rates and vaccine safety. Subjects using AI
   chatbots learn more than those with no Internet resources and are
   confident in what they learn. However, none of these attributes from AI
   usage were substantively different from those using Google searches in
   both samples and topics. Directly engaging with ChatGPT increases
   subjects' comprehension of their researched content compared to Google.
   These findings suggest that AI chatbots help promote political learning
   but are not necessarily more impactful than traditional Internet
   searches. The impact of AI evolution on shaping political discourse and
   public knowledge warrants further exploration.},

Abstract = {The politics of Australia during First World War have been analysed in
   depth by many scholars, but little attention has been paid to the
   politics of the soldiers of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF).
   Though often assumed to have been not interested in politics, this
   article demonstrates that they engaged in politics at multiple levels.
   They were concerned about decision making and power relationships within
   the AIF, in international circles and within the British empire. They
   were also active on a range of domestic political issues, particularly
   around volunteering and conscription, but also with other federal,
   state, and local issues. They engaged in the politics of shaping the
   ``digger{''} legacy. Pre-war ideologies, particularly on class issues
   and religion, were influential in shaping soldier political engagement
   and responses. Far from being political innocents, the Anzacs showed
   themselves to be interested and active in a range of political arenas.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveWe evaluate the debate concerning the impact of collective
   nongovernmental organization payment for ecosystem services on forest
   loss in low- and middle-income nations.MethodsWe analyze data for a
   sample of 79 low- and middle-income nations using a two-stage least
   squares regression model to address endogeneity on the payment for
   ecosystem services variable.ResultsWe find that collective
   nongovernmental organization led payment for ecosystem services programs
   correspond to less forest loss in low- and middle-income nations. We
   also find that agricultural exports, agricultural land area, total
   population growth, rural population growth, and urban population growth
   are related to increased forest loss.ConclusionWe conclude that
   nongovernmental organizations can cooperate with Indigenous populations
   in low- and middle-income nations to protect forests by using payment
   for ecosystem services programs.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis study investigates whether recent political events in
   South Korea, such as a presidential impeachment and changes in
   leadership, have caused a realignment of voters' political affiliations.
   We aim to determine whether political party allegiance has transitioned
   into a pattern of habitual voting in the last ten years.MethodsEmploying
   a Random Forest model based on machine learning approaches, we examined
   polling data from the last ten years of Korean presidential elections.
   Instead of relying on hypothesis-led methods, our analysis emphasizes
   the intrinsic characteristics of the data to uncover crucial elements
   affecting voter behavior in each election.ResultsOur results reveal a
   considerable consistency in voting patterns over the past decade,
   implying that allegiance to political parties has turned into a habitual
   behavior. Significant factors affecting voter choices in the 2022
   election were also recognized as indicators of election outcomes five
   and ten years prior.ConclusionThe study reveals that voter behavior in
   South Korea remains stable despite notable political changes, primarily
   influenced by habitual elements rather than substantial changes in party
   loyalty. This suggests that political allegiance has become ingrained as
   a habitual behavior for Korean voters.},

Title = {Transcending Geography: The United Kingdom's Accession to the
   Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 19},
Abstract = {Immediately after Brexit, the UK started negotiations to join the
   Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The
   decision is puzzling. First, Brexiteers lauded regaining sovereignty as
   a key benefit of Brexit, yet the UK Government sought accession to
   another trade grouping (albeit one far more restrained in regulation and
   supranationalism). Secondly, CPTPP is a Trans-Pacific project, the UK is
   not located in that geographic region. UK accession to CPTPP symbolises
   an operationalisation of the spatial imaginaries of a `free-trading'
   `Global Britain' that emerged during Brexit. It represents an
   illustrative example of a state reshaping its boundaries within a `space
   of flows' where economic interactions and the rules that order these
   transcend national territories and geographic proximity. This paper
   draws on UK government and CPTPP documents related to the accession
   process to establish how the parties understood the process and the
   reconfiguration of spatial dynamics and redefinition of the TP part of
   CPTPP to include the UK. It pays particular attention to the development
   in the discourses of imaginaries of communities of rules and norms as
   being more significant than geographic considerations in determining the
   geographic reach of a regional integration initiative like CPTPP. The
   paper argues that it was this imaginary of a community of standards and
   free-trade values that justified the recasting the UK as `belonging' in
   this regional grouping and enabled this new spatial projection for the
   UK and CPTPP.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveEconomic nationalism has been on the rise for the past two
   decades. Scholars have also noted the shift away from globalization and
   deregulation toward a more prominent role of the state in the economy. I
   explore the role played by populist governments in the increased
   adoption of economic nationalism and in this return of the state. I
   argue that the populist worldview lends itself naturally to a
   consolidation of power-not just political, but also economic. This
   consolidation of economic power results in a more prominent state even
   in countries where the populist regime is a right-leaning one.MethodsI
   test this argument quantitatively by analyzing governments in 30
   European countries since 1990, levels of state ownership in the economy,
   and a battery of economic and political controls.ResultsThe election of
   a populist government is associated with a strengthening of state
   ownership in the economy.ConclusionI conclude with a discussion of the
   prospects for the future study of this populist economic agenda both
   domestically and internationally.},

Abstract = {The United States is a global leader in estimated rates of civilian gun
   ownership, and over the past few years-as the country grappled with a
   struggling economy exacerbated by a global pandemic-gun-buying surged.
   We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic's economic impact has implications
   for gun purchasing interest, and this intersects with gendered
   expectations about familial roles. Integrating sociological scholarship
   on gender and families with consumer behavior research, and using a
   preregistered online survey of over 8000 American adults collected in
   the early months of the pandemic's emergence in the United States (May
   2020-June 2020), we hypothesize that men in familial roles may express
   greater gun interest in response to financial instability, and theorize
   why such a process may also be observed among women. Analyses show that
   men's gun interest is unaffected by family roles or financial distress.
   Women in family roles-mothers, in particular-who experience financial
   stress, however, are significantly more amenable toward guns than other
   women and express interest at levels approaching those of men. We
   discuss how such findings increase our understanding of the
   heterogeneity of gun owners.},

Abstract = {All governments have an obligation to protect their territory and the
   wealth within that territory from external predation. In fact, since war
   has historically resulted in the plunder and destruction of wealth, it
   seems straightforward to suggest that the cost of providing adequate
   defense of one's territory is a function of the accumulated wealth
   within the territory. Suppose that all wealth in society is capital. The
   accumulation of capital conveys a private benefit to its owner, but
   imposes an external cost on society. As with any externality, the
   optimal tax policy would be to tax capital. The revenue from capital
   taxation could then be used to finance defense. Such a taxation scheme,
   however, requires the state has an appropriate level of bureaucratic
   capacity. During the Middle Ages and the early Renaissance, this sort of
   state infrastructure did not exist. Yet the rulers of those states faced
   the same constraint. In this paper, I argue that the enforcement of
   usury laws during this period replicate the outcome of the optimal
   capital tax. Lending at interest was prohibited. However, rulers often
   allowed certain groups to lend in society in exchange for a license fee.
   This granted monopoly status to lenders. At the same time, rulers
   imposed binding price ceilings on interest rates. The combination of
   these three characteristics of enforcement replicate the long-run
   restriction on capital accumulation of the optimal capital tax and
   generate revenue that is possibly equivalent to the tax as well. I then
   model ruler behavior given these incentives. Finally, I use historical
   evidence from England, Italy, and France to support my argument.},

Abstract = {Objective: An extensive literature examines the prevalence of conspiracy
   theories and the factors that determine why some people believe them.
   Conspiracy theories are only one example of baseless beliefs, which we
   define as beliefs that are not epistemically warranted by the available
   evidence. The goals of this research were to determine if there are
   discrete domains of baseless beliefs and to identify the psychological
   and cognitive factors most closely associated with each type. Methods:
   We surveyed 435 U.S. adults about their baseless beliefs and measured an
   extensive set of cognitive, epistemological, and personal
   characteristics. Results: Four distinct domains of baseless belief were
   discovered, which we label conservative controversies, classic coverups,
   magical thoughts, and pseudoscience. The data suggest the confidence
   people have in these beliefs differs across domains and reveal clear
   differences in the cognitive, epistemological, and personality factors
   predicting belief in each domain. Conclusion: Baseless beliefs encompass
   a number of distinct domains, and the psychological dynamics underlying
   belief acquisition vary across these domains. This finding suggests
   caution in generalizing from studies examining only one domain. The
   prominent role of conservatism documented in the literature on
   conspiracy theories, for example, is weaker or not present at all in
   other domains.},

Title = {Inequality aversion and government health expenditure},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {84},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper explores a behavioural mechanism through which income
   inequality may be associated with population health. We consider a model
   with heterogeneous agents in which agents' preferences are characterized
   by income inequality aversion. Our analysis shows that spending on
   health-producing goods is inversely related to the agents' degree of
   inequality aversion. A Veblenesque mechanism drives this relation:
   inequality averse poor agents wish to enjoy consumption levels closer to
   the average consumption levels in the economy but can only do so by
   reducing their expenditures on health. This leads to adverse outcomes
   for individuals and adverse political economy implications for health.
   In the political economy context, agents characterized by high
   inequality aversion vote for lower levels of government health spending.
   To specifically test this mechanism, we construct empirical measures of
   inequality aversion. Then, using these measures for a panel of 147
   countries spanning 2008-2019, we find a significant negative impact of
   inequality aversion on allocations of public spending for healthcare.
   These results remain robust to different model specifications.},

Abstract = {Russian state propaganda outlets Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik are an
   important part of Russian foreign policy and key global sources of
   disinformation. Previous work has argued that they focus on exploiting
   social divisions among foreign audiences and worried that Russian
   propaganda may influence the broader media agenda. To date, though,
   there has been no comprehensive study of what RT and Sputnik actually
   cover, or any quantitative analysis of their influence on other
   coverage. We analyze 4.7 million English-language news articles from RT,
   Sputnik, and sixty-seven other news outlets linked to on Facebook from
   2017 to 2021, articles that collectively generate 22.6 billion user
   interactions. Contrary to assumptions in previous studies, RT and
   Sputnik gave modest attention to US domestic politics, focusing instead
   on a set of geopolitical issues including the Middle East, armed
   conflicts, and international statecraft. Using a VAR model, we show that
   RT and Sputnik Granger-cause coverage on its high-priority issues across
   all categories of US media: center, left-wing, right-wing, and
   far-right. On domestic issues, RT and Sputnik follow center and
   far-right outlets instead of leading. Our study is an important
   corrective to earlier scholarship, which has overstated RT and Sputnik's
   engagement with US domestic issues and blurred the specialized roles
   different Russian organizations play in malign influence operations.},

Title = {Rethinking the exercise of sovereignty in the Anthropocene: From
   extraction to environmental protection in Arctic Svalbard},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {114},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper explores the implications of the Anthropocene and its
   associated planetary awareness on the concept and exercise of
   sovereignty, particularly through the lens of the Svalbard Treaty. The
   Arctic archipelago of Svalbard is not only a space undergoing rapid
   environmental change today, but its treaty-based governance arrangements
   are based on an early-twentieth century spatial imaginary of fishery,
   coal, and resource extraction. By examining Norway's governance shift
   from resource extraction to environmental stewardship on Svalbard, this
   paper reflects on transformations of the practice of sovereignty in
   response to global environmental challenges. Through interviews with
   local stakeholders, the research highlights the contentious nature of
   these shifts, revealing how increased environmental regulations, while
   necessary, may paradoxically entrench existing power structures and
   complicate the presence of non-Norwegian entities. This case study of
   the Svalbard Treaty serves as a normative microcosm for broader issues
   of sovereignty, treaty obligations, and international governance as they
   may evolve due to planetary change, pointing to the urgent need to
   rethink these evolving dynamics. The paper underscores the pressing and
   complex challenges facing the international system in the Anthropocene,
   suggesting that while Svalbard's geopolitical stability may be
   maintained and Norwegian sovereignty remains uncontested, the
   instability of global environmental realities is already leading to
   changes to the ways in which sovereignty is exercised in the present.},

Abstract = {Science-related populism is often used to undermine public trust in
   science. Good scientific practice contributes to public trust in
   science, whereas misconduct promotes public skepticism. Since research
   ethics are a vital part of research integrity, we argue that ethical
   misconduct potentially undermines trust in scientists, particularly
   among people with populist beliefs. Drawing on a quota sample of German
   citizens (N = 1,321), the experimental study examines the influence of
   ethical conduct on trust in scientists, moderated by science-related
   populist beliefs. More specifically, we tested the influence of
   experimental deception (with and without debriefing) using a vignette
   design. The results of our study showed that ethical misconduct is
   negatively associated with trust in scientists. In addition, the
   relationship between ethical misconduct and trust in scientists was
   influenced by both science-related populist beliefs and science
   literacy. Although people with high science-related populist beliefs
   generally placed less trust in scientists, the negative effect was even
   more pronounced for people with low science-related populist beliefs.
   Our findings further revealed that ethical misconduct reduces trust in
   science among people with both low and high science literacy. This
   demonstrates the importance of researchers transparently discussing and
   reflecting on ethical research conduct to promote trust in scientists.},

Title = {American attitude towards Iran and its reflection on Iran policy towards

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study is to cover the change that happened in
   the American foreign policy toward Iran by changing the American
   leadership from Obama to Trump. In addition to its coverage for the
   Iranian foreign policy toward the Arab region during the presidency
   period of Obama in the USA and also during the presidency period of
   Trump, to discover whether a change has happened in the Iranian foreign
   policy toward the Arab region is a result of the change in the American
   foreign policy or not. This can be discovered by concentrating on Yemen,
   Syria and Iraq, taking into consideration the Iranian and American
   national interests in the Arab region, as well as the regional role of
   Iran and its intervention in the Arab
   region.Design/methodology/approachThis study was based on the analytical
   method of the foreign policy that is based on analyzing facts and
   events, as well as analyzing the roles and interests within the
   framework of the states' foreign policy. This method was used in the
   study for the purpose of analyzing the impact of the change in the
   American leadership from Obama to Trump on the US foreign policy toward
   Iran in the light of the American interest; in addition to the Iranian
   foreign policy toward the Arab region (Yemen, Syria and Iraq) in the
   presidency period of both Obama and Trump in light of the regional role
   of Iran and its passion to achieve its national interest.FindingsThe
   study concluded that the change in the American foreign policy toward
   Iran is a result of the change of the American leadership from Obama to
   Trump by the American interest requirements in accordance to the
   respective of both of them. The change in the American policy led to a
   change in the trends of the Iranian foreign policy toward the Arab
   region in the term of the regional Iranian role. Under the American and
   Iranian convergence in the period of Obama, the Iranian role in the Arab
   region was limited to what could achieve its national interest and what
   did not threaten the American interest, especially after Iran had
   guaranteed that the USA is by its side. In the framework of the American
   and Iranian confrontation under Trump's current presidency, the Iranian
   role has expanded in the Arab region, where Iran has intensified its
   intervention in Yemen, Syria and Iraq politically and militarily. Iran
   became more threatening to the American interest, as it became a means
   of pressure to the USA under Trump's ruling in the purpose of changing
   its position toward it.Originality/valueThe importance of the study
   stems from the fact that it is seeking to analyze the change of the
   American foreign policy toward Iran within the period of two different
   presidential years of Obama and Trump, whereas, their trends were
   different in dealing with Iran between rapprochement and hostility
   toward it, on the basis of the American interest. In addition to testing
   whether this change in the American foreign policy toward Iran has been
   accompanied by a change in the Iranian foreign policy toward the Arab
   region.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveA critical area of study of the federal courts includes those
   who serve on the nation's highest tribunals. While most studies of
   judicial diversity address the crucial issues of race or gender, we
   examine the cross-time dynamics of religious affiliations within the
   federal courts in the United States to more broadly encompass the
   concept of diversity.MethodsWe analyze over two centuries of data on the
   religious affiliations of judges on the District Courts and Courts of
   Appeals, as well as that of justices on the Supreme Court, by employing
   descriptive data derived from public sources and our own survey
   instrument, and multivariate time-series models.ResultsOur mixed-method
   analyses show that the federal courts, traditionally the near-exclusive
   province of Protestants, have grown more religiously diverse over time.
   We illustrate that specific, salient political events, including
   President Wilson's appointment of Supreme Court Justice Brandeis in 1916
   and the elections of Presidents Kennedy in 1960 and Carter in 1976,
   directly influenced the dynamics of religious affiliations in the
   federal courts.ConclusionsThe ascent of religious diversity in the
   federal courts was neither smooth nor inevitable. By incorporating the
   notion of belonging as a measure of religious identity and affiliation,
   we exhibit that a multifaceted process over time transformed religious
   diversity in the federal courts.},

Abstract = {We present the first field experiments on how local election officials
   can recruit and mobilize more voters to serve as poll workers. We used
   two field experiments to examine the effect of different methods and
   messaging on poll worker recruitment. In Study 1, we find that outreach
   by local election officials to people who previously served as poll
   workers may have increased participation rates compared with the control
   group. In Study 2, registered voters who had not previously served as
   poll workers were more likely to participate relative to a control group
   when treated by a recruitment mailer. Study 2 further shows that male,
   female, and older registered voters are more likely to participate as
   poll workers after they receive a recruitment mailer. The treatment
   effects were strongest for males and those aged 66 and older.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the subjection of Europe's lower-strata
   working-class Muslims to a politics of containment on two levels:
   isolation and elite capture. Departing from analogies between
   antisemitism and Islamophobia, it argues for a different comparison
   between the two that involves their effects when weaponised as
   discursive strategies. While the effects of the weaponisation of ('new')
   antisemitism tend to isolate Muslims through a de-essentialising good
   vs. bad Muslim discourse, the effects of the weaponisation of
   Islamophobia move towards the tendential dynamics of elite capture
   through a re-essentialising discourse. Instead of theorising
   identity-formation as a direct consequence of ideology, the paper
   situates both discursive strategies within a structural framework that
   involves Muslims' organisational and collectiveaction forms, which in
   turn consolidate non-class identities. The paper concludes that the
   effects of the weaponisation of both discourses are realised in the
   containment of Muslims.},

Abstract = {Several studies argue that journalism can facilitate and shape
   democratic backsliding when news organizations are captured by business
   and political elites. Under these conditions, journalists will likely
   fail to hold political actors to account and provide information
   essential for public deliberation. Gradually, news outlets devolve to
   provide unfair representations based on private interests instead of
   news coverage guided by public interest. However, research still lacks a
   systematic and detailed analysis of practices in news production that
   could be capable of damaging democracy. Not only is evidence very
   scarce, but it is also limited to the content analysis of news outputs
   and editorials. Using forty semistructured interviews and three case
   studies, this research investigates how journalists from the most
   influential outlets in Brazil covered key political events within a
   period of constant decline in the quality of democracy (2016-2021).
   Then, I build on the results to propose a new typology of
   de-democratizing journalistic practices: soft steering (recommendations
   pretending concern with standards, including partisan interpretations of
   balance), hard steering (direct orders, including internal censorship or
   entirely pre-defined stories), and anticipatory steering (reporters and
   editors act on their own based on perceptions and previous
   instructions). Moreover, this research offers evidence that
   de-democratizing journalistic practices can be internalized by news
   practitioners and, over time, replace democratic norms. Finally, it
   suggests a dynamic relationship between censorship and self-censorship
   in which control not only inhibits actions but also compels journalists
   to perform in specific ways.},

Abstract = {Peace is often represented as a matter of time, as a political state
   that happens after war. This special issue contests this linear and
   binary view by giving an account of being and thinking between the
   boundaries of peace and war. It challenges mainstream ideas, political
   discourses, and collective imaginaries about the location of violence,
   peace, and peacebuilding. It does so by providing empirical and
   theoretical arguments as to why Peace and Conflict Studies and
   Geographies of Peace should widen their scope of empirical sites to
   include contexts of non-war violence, such as military urbanism,
   counterterrorism, police violence, migration, environmental struggles,
   and continued everyday violence and peacebuilding in different locations
   such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Kenya, Lebanon,
   and Northern Ireland. To do so, the special issue presents four
   theoretical lines of inquiry: 1) spatiality; 2) temporality; 3) feminist
   phenomenology and; 4) decolonial thought. Collectively, the articles
   make a strong case, epistemologically, theoretically, and
   methodologically, about peace as a complex embodied experience that
   should be analysed in time and space. The special issue concludes by
   calling for `making space for peace' through in-betweenness, care, and
   non-violent resistance.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the pace of Internet regulation around the world has
   quickened, with states increasingly confident that they can and should
   hold major platform companies to account. New laws have been developed
   to address the risks of digital technologies and law-makers have drawn
   on familiar regulatory principles and legacy frameworks in addressing
   them. But the nature of the technologies and the business models
   supporting them bring new challenges which make it less clear that old
   approaches will work. To succeed, legislative frameworks must evolve and
   adapt. Against this backdrop we assess the UK's Online Safety Act 2023
   (OSA), which was expected to provide an innovative and broad-reaching
   `systems-based' approach to reducing user risks and harms, particularly
   in relation to child safety. We argue that although the Act does
   incorporate measures to regulate platform design, it fails to fully
   embrace this and faces some challenges in ensuring proportionality and
   accountability. We conclude that the development of the OSA is hampered
   by a legacy focus on content controls which may limit its ability to
   effectively improve online safety, particularly as services evolve.},

Title = {What Makes Fact-Checking Effective? Exploratory Research into the Role
   of Linguistic Politeness},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {This study examined how the linguistic politeness of fact-checking
   messages affects audiences' belief accuracy and message acceptance by
   shaping their perceived face threat and psychological reactance. In 2
   experiments with national convenience samples of South Korean adults, we
   manipulated linguistic politeness by using either honorific or
   non-honorific sentence endings-a well-established marker of linguistic
   politeness in Korean-in fact-checking news articles correcting
   misinformation about COVID-19 (Study 1) and refugees (Study 2). Study 1
   (N = 240) found that fact-checking articles using honorific sentence
   endings were perceived as less face-threatening than those presenting
   identical content with non-honorific endings, which in turn increased
   belief accuracy and the perceived persuasiveness of the articles. Study
   2 (N = 296) replicated the findings of Study 1 and extended them by
   demonstrating: (1) the effect of using honorific (vs. non-honorific)
   sentence endings on recipients' perceived face threat was not moderated
   by their conspiratorial predisposition or need for cognition; (2) the
   effects of perceived face threat were mediated by psychological
   reactance; and (3) the sequential mediation also produced attitudinal
   effects. The findings are discussed in light of their theoretical and
   practical implications for designing effective fact-checking messages to
   combat misinformation in non-Western languages.},

Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDIOS SOCIO-JURIDICOS},

Abstract = {Over the past decades, the Brazilian Judiciary has created teams with
   different types of experts (e.g., psychologists, social workers) to
   assist courts in judicial decision-making, especially by enlightening
   nonlegal aspects deemed essential to ensuring rights. These
   multidisciplinary teams, however, often recommend how courts should deal
   with each case. This theoretical article discusses the limits of
   multidisciplinary teams when recommending legal decisions. For this
   purpose, it first presents claims that justify the recommendations made
   by multidisciplinary teams. Then, a critical analysis of the
   implications of this practice is provided. In the end, it is argued that
   multidisciplinary teams should refrain from recommending judicial
   decisions and should limit their opinions to their areas of expertise,
   except in cases where legislation explicitly demands experts' opinions
   on legal matters.},

Abstract = {Studies of academic freedom have mostly focussed on Europe and North
   America. Yet, any consideration of the societal crises in Africa cannot
   ignore the collapse of its universities and the very concept of academic
   freedom on the continent. Much had been expected of the universities. In
   Africa, the early post-independence universities took off on
   internationally competitive and solid foundations-thanks to the
   heritages and traditions bequeathed them by the colonial powers that
   established them. In these societies, the expectations associated with
   the formation and performance of the universities have their foundations
   in the historical evidence furnished by the definitions of success in
   the West. However, the postcolonial orientations of the universities in
   Africa have proceeded along different pathways. Ideas taken from one
   milieu to another can develop in unpredictable ways and may satisfy
   needs other than those served in their places of origin. Institutions
   transplanted from one society can be influenced by the practices
   prevalent in the receiving societies. The forces acting upon such
   interactions are complex. The resultant transformative impacts are also
   unpredictable. An appreciation of context is therefore compelling. This
   article discusses the crisis in Nigeria's political economy and its
   impact on the public universities.},

   examining the role of analytic thinking and post-critical beliefs},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the political and scholarly
   attention on conspiracy theories. Among other predictors, religious and
   spiritual influences on conspiracy beliefs have been widely discussed in
   the literature. We suggest analyzing the relationship between religion
   and spirituality on the one hand and conspiracy beliefs on the other
   hand from the perspective of religious information processing. Based on
   the Post-Critical Beliefs Scale (PCBS), we argue that literal
   interpretations of religious information are positively associated with
   conspiracy beliefs. Furthermore, we assume that individual differences
   in analytic cognitive style account for the relationship between
   religious attitudes, spirituality, and conspiracism. Using a quota
   sample of German adults, we find that literal interpretations of
   religious content positively correlate with conspiracy beliefs for the
   literal affirmation of transcendence (e.g., orthodoxy) and the literal
   disaffirmation of transcendence (e.g., atheism). These findings suggest
   that religious information processing is related to conspiracy beliefs
   for religious and nonreligious individuals. Moreover, our results show a
   stable association between holistic spirituality and conspiracy beliefs.
   The relationships between different types of religious attitudes,
   spirituality, and conspiracy beliefs hold, even after accounting for
   analytic (versus intuitive) thinking. The implications for the study of
   religious attitudes and conspiracy beliefs are discussed.},

Abstract = {Disputes on property rights date back to the ancient times. Having
   undergone extensive development, the right to property can be protected
   through a vindication claim and actio negatoria which are the most
   common of the private legal means of protecting property rights within
   the domestic judicial proceedings in Georgia. Within the Council of
   Europe, ``existing property{''} and legitimate expectations to acquire
   an asset are safeguarded by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the European
   Convention on Human Rights, which enjoys supremacy over domestic
   legislation, including the country's Constitution. The European Court of
   Human Rights differentiates between three rules on how protection of
   property is represented under this provision and interprets the state's
   positive obligations in securing property rights, including through
   investigation.},

Abstract = {This study explores the impact of female political empowerment on air
   quality outcomes. Women's stronger environmental concerns and pro
   -environmental behaviors may lead to better air quality as they
   progressively break the glass ceiling in politics. To test this
   hypothesis, we employ a novel data set on regional air pollutant
   emissions and women's political empowerment for a sample of 230 European
   regions of 27 EU countries. We apply instrumental variables and partial
   identification methods to ensure that our results are not influenced by
   confounding variables. We find that female political empowerment is
   consistently associated with improved air quality.},

Title = {Geopolitical risk and tourism in Turkey},
Journal = {REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to show the effect of Turkey's
   geopolitical risk on the number of international tourist arrivals to the
   country. When Turkish economy in 2019 is analyzed, it is seen that the
   share of tourism in national income is 11\%. For this reason, national
   economy is significantly affected by changing of the number of
   international tourist arrivals. Security problems are an important
   variable affecting tourist arrivals.Design/methodology/approachThe paper
   focused on secondary data for the period 2000-2019 for macroeconomic
   variables. Accordingly, the number of international tourist arrivals was
   added as a dependent variable, geopolitical risk as an independent
   variable, gross domestic product (GDP) and economic freedom index as
   control variables and inflations as an external variable to the model.
   The residual augmented least squares-the autoregressive distributive lag
   (RALS-ADL) cointegration test and the dynamic ordinary least squares
   (DOLS) coefficient estimator were used. It allows for more robust
   results to be obtained when the residues do not have a normal
   distribution.FindingsThe RALS-ADL cointegration test result shows that
   there is a cointegration relationship between variables at a 1\%
   significance level. Moreover, the DOLS coefficient estimator results
   indicate that an increase in economic freedom and GDP increase the
   number of international tourists, whereas an increase in the
   Geopolitical Risk Index and inflation decreases the number of
   international tourism arrival. It can be said that tourists consider the
   security and economic stability of the host country when making tourism
   decisions.Originality/valueTurkey is one of the most risky developing
   countries, as well as one of the most popular travel destinations. When
   the literature is examined, it has been found that studies for Turkey
   usually determine the relationship between the variables for a short
   period of time. However, to ensure sustainable growth and environment of
   confidence, the long-run relationship between variables should be
   determined so that policymakers can make more impactful decisions.
   Therefore, the aim of this study is to make a literature contribution,
   taking into account the long-term effects. In addition, unlike other
   studies, this study fills the gap in literature using the RALS-ADL
   cointegration test, which produces robust estimators.},

Abstract = {The future - as a theme, research orientation, and mode of framing
   societal challenges - is becoming important in the social sciences. Yet
   the absence of collective action in many such accounts makes clear the
   potential contribution of social movement studies. In social movement
   studies, meanwhile, the future has been discussed directly and
   indirectly. Assumptions about timing, activist orientations towards the
   future, and causation are embedded in understandings of strategy,
   agency, mobilisation, tactical choice, consequences, and in concepts of
   waves, cycles and diffusion. Conceptual developments around
   temporalities, real utopias and grassroots initiatives, imagination, and
   prefiguration offer some alternative perspectives and promising new
   directions. Foregrounding social movement futures also has implications
   for protesters themselves: ideas and emotions relating to the future are
   central to activist debates about goals, winning, utopia, hope and
   burnout. This introduction reviews the societal and academic context for
   the renewed interest in futures that are relevant for social movement
   studies, before outlining three major movement areas or debates where
   futures are implicated, and which need to form part of future research.
   These areas, and the subdiscipline as a whole, it is argued, may also
   benefit from a more direct analysis of movement futures.},

Abstract = {Seeking to add a comparative element to the study of patron-client
   relations, this article introduces a multidimensional measurement tool
   for analysing de facto-patron state relations. The tool is used to
   measure military, political, societal and cultural resource exchange
   sustaining de facto state patron-client relationships, focusing on the
   client side of this dyadic relationship as this is where the defining
   features of patron-client relationships are most evident due to the
   asymmetry of resources. The study uses original data on Abkhazia,
   Kosovo, Nagorno-Karabakh, Northern Cyprus, Taiwan, Transnistria and
   their respective patron states. Comparing their degrees of dependence
   and differences based on the type of patronage, the article also
   discusses the merits and shortcomings of the tool, inviting further
   development.},

Title = {The geography of educational voting: Understanding where individuals
   with similar qualifications vote differently across Britain},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {112},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study offers a novel account of the geographical variation in the
   association of educational attainment with electoral behaviour. It
   estimates multilevel random-coefficient models using survey data from
   the British Election Study Internet Panel and data on constituency
   characteristics to explore the extent to which, and reasons why, the
   voting behaviours of individuals with identical qualifications varied
   across different types of parliamentary constituencies in British
   general elections from 2015 to 2019. We find the geography of this
   educational cleavage has not been evenly distributed in recent years.
   While the individual-level association of educational attainment and
   vote choice indeed varied geographically at the 2015, 2017 and 2019
   general elections, there is only limited evidence to suggest that
   similarly educated individuals voted differently in constituencies with
   low and high densities of persons with high levels of education. Rather,
   our findings suggest that constituency left behind-ness (broadly
   defined) is the most important factor in explaining the spatial
   heterogeneity of education-based voting in recent British general
   elections.},

Abstract = {Military statues are being attacked and removed in multiple countries,
   but there is little analytic work on the associated reasons. Therefore,
   this research aimed to conduct a nationwide survey of outdoor military
   statues in a case study country (New Zealand) and identify reasons for
   attacks. Of the 118 statues identified, 11 (9\%) of these had been
   physically attacked. A key risk factor for statue attack was it being
   linked to the colonial-era New Zealand Wars versus any other specific
   war (75\% vs 8\%, p = .003). This finding fitted with other evidence
   from attacks on statues of named New Zealanders (e.g. politicians) and
   on attacks of other types of monuments to these particular wars. It is
   also consistent with past and persisting injustices experienced by the
   Indigenous M \& amacr;ori population. In conclusion, some of the attacks
   on the military statues in this country appear to reflect social
   injustices and harm from colonialism.},

Title = {Contest and resource allocation: An experimental analysis of entitlement
   and self-selection effects},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {82},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Leaders who decide the allocation of resources are often chosen through
   contests. Due to imperfect monitoring, they often decide to allocate
   resources to themselves at the expense of others. This paper
   investigates how being selected in a contest affects such allocation
   through two channels: entitlement and self-selection effects. In our
   experiment, two players compete for the right to allocate resources
   between themself and a third, uninvolved player. We identify the
   entitlement effect by comparing the choices of participants who
   participated in the contest with those who were chosen randomly.
   Self-selection effect is identified by comparing the choices of winners
   and losers between treatments via a difference -in -difference approach.
   We find a significant effect of entitlement; people participating in the
   contest transfer fewer resources to the third player compared to those
   who did not participate. Further, we find no evidence that the people
   with specific distributional preferences self-select into the leaders'
   role. Our findings suggest that the primary reason leaders allocate
   resources to themselves is their involvement in the contest rather than
   being a result of self-selection.},

   Terrorism), a self-described anti-fascist meme group active on platforms
   such as Twitter/X, Facebook, and Instagram, as well as their own
   website. Behind the seeming unseriousness of this endeavour is a
   deliberate approach, grounded in the view that Bosnian youth are not
   apathetic, but ignored; that they are actively being targeted by the far
   right through memes and other mirthful means; and that attempts to
   engage youth in left political action must meet them on their own turf.
   As they attempt to meet young people where they are, the CATs engage in
   what they call ``more-than-activism{''}, a serendipitous nod to the
   more-than-real spaces they create through their digital and physical
   activities. Drawing on cyberfeminism and recent work in digital
   geography, the article argues for an approach to young people's politics
   that is sensitive to their embodied experiences, including in the
   digital parts of their lives. Through a more-than-real approach, we can
   understand how seemingly ephemeral objects like memes come to matter in
   the making and unmaking of political projects.},

Abstract = {BackgroundRecent years have witnessed a growing interest among academics
   and policymakers in understanding the mechaninsms through which Chinese
   outward direct investment (OFDI) impact economic growth in
   Africa.MethodThis study utilzes a dataset spanning 41 African countries
   from 2005 to 2020,employing panel-corrected standard error (PCSE) and
   quantile regression.ObjectiveThis study explore the mechanisms through
   which Chinese OFDI stock contributes to economic growth in Africa,with a
   particular focus on financial development and transport
   infrastructure.ResultsThe results indicate a significant and positive
   impact of the interaction between Chinese OFDI stock and both financial
   development and transport infrastructure on economic growth. The
   subregional analysis reveals varying correlations across regions, while
   the quantile regression analysis demonstrates a stronger effect on
   economic growth as we move to higher quantiles.ConclusionThe study
   underscores the importance of enhancing infrastructure and financial
   sector development to attract more Chinese OFDI and maximize its
   positive impact of economic growth in African nations. Hence, we
   recommend that African countries improve the infrastructure and
   financial sector of their country to attract more chinese OFDI and also
   enhance its effectiveness on their economic growth.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesElection observers have expressed concerns about voter
   ``confusion{''} under ranked choice voting (RCV) since the 1890s. What
   is the meaning of ``confusing,{''} and how does it affect behavior? We
   argue (with much of the literature) that ranking candidates for public
   office is a cognitively complex task because of a lack of
   information.MethodsWe explore some observable implications of this
   perspective using exit poll data from the first RCV election in Santa
   Fe, New Mexico, in 2018.ResultsSixteen percent of voters reported having
   felt very (6 percent) or somewhat (10 percent) confused, and Hispanic
   voters were more likely to be confused than white voters. Confused
   voters report ranking fewer candidates, have lower confidence in
   ballot-counting accuracy, and are less supportive of RCV than
   nonconfused voters.ConclusionsThese results raise questions about RCV's
   equity, participation costs for voters, ease of use, and longevity.},

Abstract = {This study explores how enterprise digital transformation affects audit
   quality. The results show that the relationship between enterprise
   digital transition and audit quality takes on a U-shaped. Mechanism test
   results indicate that during the initial stages of digitization, the
   restrictive effect of auditor's professional competence mismatch
   predominates. Conversely, during the mature stages of digitization, the
   promotion effect of improved auditor's substantive independence
   predominates. Heterogeneity tests demonstrate that this U-shaped
   relationship is significant primarily within the sample set of short
   audit tenure and state-owned enterprises. The study reveals the internal
   mechanism of the impact of enterprise digital transition on audit
   quality, offering empirical evidence to comprehend the incremental
   dynamic effects of enterprise digitalization and mitigate potential
   adverse consequences throughout the transformation process.},

Abstract = {A global shift toward plant-based diets could significantly mitigate the
   negative impact of the food system on the environment, health, and
   animal welfare. While information provision has become a popular tool
   among policy-makers and social scientists to push consumers toward more
   sustainable diets, little is known about the population's knowledge
   about the benefits of adopting a plant-based diet. Using data from a
   representative sample of the French population (N = 715), we elicit the
   average knowledge about the relative merits of plant-based diets on the
   environment, health, and animal welfare. We show that people have on
   average a good knowledge of the relatively lower environmental impact of
   plant-based diets (GHG, land use) but considerably underestimate their
   health benefits. We also find that people significantly underestimate
   the prevalence of intensive farming and, therefore, the merits of
   adopting a plant-based diet for the animals. Our results show that
   society is predominantly divided into two groups: those who have a
   positive opinion of plant-based diets on all dimensions, and those who
   see less benefit in plant-based diets on all dimensions. We discuss the
   implications of these findings for the role of information campaigns in
   changing people's diets.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {81},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Theory suggests that employee trust is key to productivity in
   organizations, but empirical evidence documenting links between trust
   and performance constraints is scarce. This paper analyzes self
   -collected observational and experimental data on public sector
   employees from eighteen Latin American countries and finds that
   individual -level trust is relevant to three types of performance
   factors. First, high -trust employees are more willing to collaborate
   and share information with coworkers and are more supportive of
   technological innovation. Second, hightrust employees have different
   perceptions of organizational constraints: they are less concerned with
   low staff quality or lack of discretion to innovate, and more concerned
   with staff shortages. Third, trust in coworkers is associated with
   stronger mission motivation. These findings are robust to instrumental
   variable strategies based on the transmission of trust through social or
   professional channels. A survey experiment on preferences for social
   distancing policies shows how trust enhances mission motivation:
   employee policy preferences align better with the implied government
   policy when their trust in the public sector is higher.},

Title = {Working with water: a dialogue on care, infrastructure and labour},
Journal = {TERRITORY POLITICS GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 27},
Abstract = {In this contribution, we show the significance of care as a lens for
   understanding infrastructuring labour that is the work of operating,
   maintaining and repairing infrastructure. We do this focusing on water
   infrastructure and drawing from scholarship on feminist Science and
   Technology Studies, infrastructural labour geography and critical water
   research. We propose dialoguing among researchers as an experimental
   practice for fostering situated learning about infrastructuring labour
   across sites and infrastructure. More specifically, we examine the work
   of tanker drivers in supplying water in Accra (Ghana) and of workers and
   engineers in regulating water flows along the transboundary Moselle
   River (Germany, Luxembourg, France). Looking at care as
   response-abilities, tinkering and ethico-political commitments, we show
   infrastructuring labour is about planned and improvised interventions
   that are carried out involving material work and technical knowledge as
   well as social and emotional work.},

Title = {Relational resources: Moving from plural to entangled extractivisms},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {110},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Increasing studies of extractivisms, in the plural, examine the diverse
   politics that permeate extractive activities. However useful, this
   appeal to plurality is problematic. Plurality without relationality
   risks justifying some extractive activities over others, without
   addressing how they relate. Drawing on anti-essentialist, decolonial,
   and political ecological scholarship, this article proposes an
   ontological reframing of extractivisms that troubles the division and
   comparison that pervade notions of taxonomic plurality, and emphasizes
   the mutual constitution articulated within the concept of relationality.
   Analyses of relational resources are better equipped to illuminate the
   power-laden associations through which supposedly distinct commodity
   values, extractive geographies, sectors, and governance regimes shape
   one another. Beyond complicating rigid definitions of extractive
   categories, this ontological shift requires distinct methodologies for
   understanding and contesting entangled extractive interests and logics.
   It implicates what forms of anti-extractive resistance, solidarities,
   and alternative futures become viable, thinkable, and necessary.},

Abstract = {Populist radical right (PRR) parties tend to stress their differences
   from other parties. Yet at the same time, PRR parties have increasingly
   sought to integrate into party systems across the globe. In seeking to
   understand the way that PRR parties negotiate this paradoxical
   situation, the literature tends to focus on their policy offerings or
   discourse. We, on the contrary, investigate an underestimated aspect of
   their political communication: their visuals. Namely, we focus on the
   question of if and how PRR parties communicate their similarities or
   differences from other parties via the color profiles of their logos,
   given that color is a key way that political parties can signal (a)
   their ideological commitments (via hue) and (b) their approach to
   ``valence{''} considerations (via saturation). We expect PRR parties'
   attempts to signal their integration into party systems to be mainly
   sought via saturation, as a proxy for valence perceptions related to
   parties' seriousness and competence, while we expect them to signal
   their difference from other parties via hue, given the incentive for PRR
   parties to communicate their ideological distance from non-populist
   parties as a marker of distinctiveness in the political market. We test
   our research questions by analyzing parties' logos across 35 democracies
   in recent elections. Results largely confirm our expectations,
   demonstrating the utility of focusing on the visual aspects of PRR
   parties' political communication. Interestingly, the results do not
   replicate if we focus on populist parties beyond the PRR party family.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the intersections of religion, heritage, and
   politics in divided societies by focusing on two events that occurred in
   Cyprus before the crossing points opened (2003). These are the Greek and
   Turkish Cypriot reciprocal pilgrimages to a Christian and Muslim site,
   respectively, and the two sites' restoration. I argue that in these
   events the Cyprus Issue effected the transformation of pilgrimage
   practices and sites into matters of political agreement, implicating
   them in processes of conflict management and resolution. In this
   context, pilgrimage facilitated inter-communal exchanges and
   intra-communal frictions and antagonisms that question binary
   oppositions through which questions of conflict and amity have been
   debated in pilgrimage studies.},

Title = {Green resilience: Securing life through vegetal being},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {109},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper critically examines the concept of ``green resilience{''} -
   the mobilization of gardens and urban green spaces for enhancing the
   resilience of communities and cities in the face of increasing
   uncertainty and risk. Drawing inspiration from seminal work in
   human-plant geographies, it explores the governmental functions and
   political implications of green resilience, arguing that these spaces
   serve as key forms of state rule and biopolitical power. The study
   employs the notion of green resilience as a ``composition,{''}
   emphasizing the assembling of diverse human and nonhuman actors in
   resilience projects. The developed compositional ontology highlights the
   importance of aesthetic and visual practices in green resilience
   projects and reveals how these are continuously decomposed and
   recomposed by the involved actors. The paper develops its arguments
   through a ``paradigmatic case study{''} of various green resilience
   projects in New York City - including survivor trees, memorial groves,
   and community gardens. The study illuminates the multiplicity of green
   resilience initiatives and the underlying governmental logic by
   comparing these projects. Through its analysis, the paper contributes to
   the literature on resilience as an emerging governance paradigm. It
   reveals how green resilience projects embody a multiplicity of
   practices, uncovers the first comprehensive comparative analysis of
   various forms of green resilience, and offers a critique of resilience
   from within. The study concludes by identifying three tensions or
   contradictions of (green) resilience as a form of biopolitical
   government: visibility and invisibility, knowledge and ignorance, and
   control and emergence.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveAlthough other social science disciplines have considered
   researcher positionality, whether a researcher belongs to the
   communities they study (insider) or does not (outsider), public
   administration scholars have yet to examine this aspect of scholarly
   production nor its impacts on perceptions of research quality.MethodsWe
   use a data set of 554 articles from eight top public administration
   journals that focus on a single or a few states in the United States as
   the research setting. Using in-state authorship as a proxy for insider
   research, we test whether insider status significantly affects citation
   rates for these articles.ResultsFindings indicate that citation rates
   are higher for in-state authors, but the journal impact factor serves as
   a critical moderating factor. Articles written by in-state authors in
   Public Administration Review or Journal of Public Administration
   Research \& Theory (the field's top two journals) are cited around 30
   percent more than out-of-state authors, and we estimate that the
   articles across journals likely to be cited most are written by in-state
   authors.ConclusionAlthough there is room for strong insider and outsider
   research in social sciences, generally, and public administration,
   specifically, scholars should remain mindful of positionality from both
   the production and consumption sides of the research process.},

Abstract = {By drawing on ethnographic and historical accounts of migrant smuggling
   and forgery from the smugglers' perspectives, this essay shifts the
   focus from a state-centric understanding of smuggling as a criminal
   activity conducted by `greedy' individuals and `mafia rings', to a
   specific form of practice that operates through a series of concrete
   material techniques. It argues that smuggling recognises and reworks the
   material and technological features of borders which are vulnerable to
   reappropriation. These vulnerabilities inherent to the materialisation
   of abstract notions such as borders are understood and discussed as
   `reproducibility', `repetition', and `imitation'. Smuggling not only
   reconfigures the apparatus of borders to provide support for those who
   are denied access to mobility, but also can teach us something about a
   specific mode of critique that I call a material mode of critique. The
   material mode of critiquing borders goes beyond a discursive mode which
   mostly locates politicians, academics, and activists as the critics of
   border politics. This mode can open up new possibilities of thinking

Abstract = {The recent success of far-right populism has led to a wave of public
   attention to its causes. Drawing on novel survey items from the Canadian
   Election Study, we investigate how economic insecurity, mediated by
   immigration and feminist attitudes, affects voting behavior. While
   economic distress has been linked to far-right voting in Europe, we find
   support that subjective measures of economic distress are significantly
   associated with voting for the Right in Canada, when interacting with
   immigration and feminist attitudes. However, the association only holds
   for men. The findings suggest that Canada, despite its comparatively
   weak nativist cleavage, is not immune to tensions arising from
   globalization and economic insecurity.},

Abstract = {Despite the growing sexuality-related scholarship on Central and Eastern
   Europe (CEE), the history of non-normative sexualities under state
   socialism remains theorized mainly through totalizing narratives. These
   problematic discourses have contributed to the theorization of LGBT+
   experience in the CEE region solely through narratives of oppression,
   criminalization, and persecution of homosexuality, therefore emptying
   the history of CEE from any development of LGBT+ activism and by
   rendering the existence of non-normative sexualities even more
   invisible. I argue that in contrast to such essentialist
   representations, which in turn are juxtaposed with representations of
   the West as a homoerotic paradise, there were also different forms of
   political resistance that contributed to sexual emancipation in
   state-socialist countries. For this reason, I depart from
   Western-centric understandings of conventional forms of political
   organizing and take as a vantage point the cruising areas where men
   sought to fulfill same-sex desires under the oppressive regime in
   communist Albania. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, I conceptualize
   these urban spaces not only as areas of sexual encounter but as grounds
   of political resistance, therefore `queering' the forms of grassroots
   politics within the geo-temporality of state-socialism in Albania.},

Abstract = {In the contemporary times, with the major conflict of the Russo
   -Ukrainian War, the global economies are facing several challenges and
   disputes in various economic, energy, and financial sectors. Still,
   policymakers and scholars are concerned about exploring factors
   affecting greener energy. The present study examines the impact of
   research and development (R\&D) budgets, financial globalization and
   socio-economic conditions on greener energy adoption. Besides, this
   study considers the role of internal and external conflicts on greener
   energy adoption in the ``Emerging Seven{''} economies during the period
   1990-2020. Using various diagnostic and cointegration tests, the results
   revealed the presence of cross-sectional dependence, heterogeneous
   slopes and a longrun equilibrium relationship. This study employes panel
   quantile regression and finds that R\&D budgets, financial
   globalization, socio-economic conditions and internal and external
   conflicts significantly promote greener energy adoption. Still, the
   influence of socio-economic conditions is inconsistent across quantiles.
   Using the autoregressive distributed lag model as a robustness measure,
   this study validates the positive impact of variables on greener energy
   adoption, except external conflicts. However, all the variables
   adversely influence greener energy adoption in the short run. The
   empirical results also validate bidirectional and unidirectional causal
   associations of the variables. Following the results, this study
   recommends further enhancement in the R\&D budgets and financial
   globalization and limiting conflicts in emerging economies.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the identity of the women of the single party
   during Francoism, analyzing their social origins as << old shirts >> of
   the Falange prior to 1936, and the inflation in the ranks of FET-JONS
   during and after the conflict. Using the various theoretical approaches
   to the organization, chronologies and case studies from all over Spain,
   we will try to understand what was the power of attraction of the only
   legal female << political >> organization during the dictatorship, in
   the various stages of its existence. It was in the reactionary
   trajectory of affluent families, where we observed how their daughters
   were encouraged to first support the campaigns against the
   secularization of the Republican State; vote for the right in 1933, and
   then compensate << their fallen >> in the Civil War. In the words of
   Pilar Primo de Rivera, the most important thing was not the adult
   organization or its youths, << who are like the battlements of our
   towers, {[}but] those dead who are really our foundations, who are our
   roots >>.},

Abstract = {This paper explores Kornai's intellectual legacy by focusing on two
   major concepts that were constantly present in his works, namely system
   paradigm and soft budget constraints (SBC). These two concepts provided
   the underlying tenets of Kornai's original contribution to an important
   subfield of economic science during the cold war, known as ``comparative
   economic systems{''}. The concept of SBC had a much stronger impact on
   the profession in the West. However, for the Chinese, Russian, and
   virtually all Eastern European readers of Kornai, his principal message
   was that the dysfunctional properties of socialism were endemic,
   systemic, and that it could not be reformed. Ultimately, Kornai's
   revolutionary perspective was inspired by the systems paradigm which,
   along with CBL, reflects his theoretical legacy in both East and West.
   In this paper, I will argue that while Kornai's conceptualization of the
   system paradigm started with institutional (notably political)
   neutrality and ended with institutional (notably political) centrality,
   his formulation of soft budget constraints followed an opposite path.
   Theorizing SBC, he began with institutional centrality and terminated
   with institutional neutrality. I will conclude the paper by suggesting a
   solution to the puzzle of Kornai's intellectual legacy moving in two
   opposite directions regarding his two major theoretical contributions.},

   justice for women victims of domestic violence that un Women (2018)
   identifies as situational circumstances. The objective is to analyze the
   situational circumstances and their relationship with the right of
   access to justice for women victims of domestic violence. The
   methodology used was qualitative, analytical inductive logic. The
   present situational circumstances limit the opportunity for women to
   exercise the right of access to justice under conditions of equality in
   opposition to the principle of universality, placing the validity of
   this fundamental right in crisis.},

Abstract = {Following the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the Spring of
   2022, both traditional and new media were full of images of fleeing
   humans, often accompanied by non-human animal companions. Consequently,
   the EU and individual European states had to manage animals crossing
   borders, seeking safety and shelter. This article explores how animals
   become part of a geopolitically significant security composition as
   refugees. Animals and their geographies have traditionally not been
   theorised in relation to security, but researchers from different fields
   have begun to question this anthropocentric viewpoint. Three forms of
   encounters are explored: political, organisational, and empathetic.
   Crisis and war are largely transnational events, where international
   relations and organisations play a part. When the role of animals in
   this context is recognised, their power becomes transnational and they
   become subjects of what Hobson called an enlarged political geography.
   It is concluded that animals are a present and constitutive force in
   society because cross-species relations affect much of human action.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveSupport for gay rights has increased in the publics of many
   countries over recent decades, but the scholarship on the topic has been
   hindered by the limited available data on these trends in public
   opinion. The goal of the Support for Gay Rights (SGR) dataset is to
   overcome this problem.MethodThe SGR dataset is constructed by combining
   a comprehensive collection of survey data with a latent-variable model
   to provide annual time-series estimates of public support for gay rights
   across 118 countries and over as many as 51 years that are comparable
   across space and time.ResultsWe show these data perform well in
   validation tests and demonstrate their potential by replicating the
   influential but recently questioned finding of Andersen and Fetner that
   more income inequality yields less tolerant and supportive attitudes
   toward gay people.ConclusionWe anticipate that the SGR data will become
   a crucial source for cross-national, cross-regional, and longitudinal
   research that improves our understanding of the sources and consequences
   of public support for gay rights.},

   counter-revenge in Poland},
Journal = {TERRITORY POLITICS GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 13},
Abstract = {This article examines the persistence of territorial inequality and the
   challenges posed by growing geographic political polarisation, using
   Poland as a compelling case study. In 2015, the anti-elite and
   Eurosceptic PiS party came to power, holding it for eight years before
   losing to a broad coalition of liberal, centrist, and left-wing parties.
   We study the geography of this political shift by analysing
   parliamentary election results from 2011 to 2023 against the backdrop of
   growing regional socio-economic divides. Our findings reveal that the
   support base of the PiS gradually expanded in areas characterised by
   multidimensional peripherality, aligning with the theory of the `revenge
   of places that do not matter'. Meanwhile, the recent victory of the
   liberal coalition can be attributed to the political mobilisation of
   prosperous core areas - a `counter-revenge of places that matter' -
   which has further intensified the geography of political polarisation in
   Poland.},

Title = {Risk Perceptions of Misinformation Exposure Across Platforms, Issues,
   Modalities, and Countries: A Comparative Study Across the Global North
   and South},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS},

Abstract = {Mis- and disinformation have been associated with detrimental political
   consequences, such as increasing ideological and epistemic polarization.
   Yet, we know little about how people perceive the risks of
   misinformation across countries and domains of information. As holding
   high-risk perceptions of encountering misinformation across domains may
   result in high levels of media cynicism and uncertainty, it is important
   to explore news users' relative risk perceptions related to mis- and
   disinformation. Therefore, this article relies on original survey data
   collected in seven countries: Argentina (N = 507), Brazil (N = 650),
   Chile (N = 485), Mexico (N = 461), the United States (N = 521), Spain (N
   = 576), and the Netherlands (N = 518) (total N = 3,718). Main findings
   indicate that news users arrive at high estimates of mis- and
   disinformation's proportion across all countries. Although higher-risk
   information domains (i.e., political advertising) are generally more
   likely to be associated with misinformation than lower-risk domains
   (i.e., scientific evidence), our findings foreground important
   country-level differences that relate to varying levels of resilience
   across the seven democracies studied. Our findings offer important
   evidence for the relative assessments of risk related to misinformation
   across contexts that vary on vulnerability to the threats of
   misinformation.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis article examines the incidence and effects of the most
   common ballot ordering procedure used in U.S. general elections,
   Prevailing Party laws, which give the most advantageous ballot position
   to the currently prevailing political party.MethodsPanel regression and
   regression discontinuity analyses are applied to almost 50 years of
   county-level election data from Wyoming.ResultsPrevailing Party laws
   generally increase the favored candidate's vote share by two percentage
   points or more, enough to flip the result of roughly 1 percent of major
   elections nationwide.ConclusionsThe effect of Prevailing Party laws is
   substantially larger than that of more innocuous ballot ordering
   schemes, due to ``endorsement effects{''} these other schemes lack. The
   existing literature, which exclusively analyzes these other schemes,
   substantially understates the degree to which ballot order can be used
   to maintain political power.},

Title = {Beyond the eternal present of migration. Time and biographies in
   migrants' collective action},
Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 29},
Abstract = {The proliferation of media, political and academic discourses on
   migration has contributed to the construction of an often fixed and
   stereotyped image of migrants, built in a context of ever-present
   crisis. A key feature of this process of objectification is a temporal
   stasis that traps people in what can be described as an eternal present
   of migration: an existence that begins with the act of migrating, to
   which one is continually brought back and reduced. This paper engages in
   a reflexive critique of the quasi-objectified status of migrants by
   focusing on the empirical case of migrants' collective action. It
   examines the micro-level of participants who mobilize as migrants in the
   public sphere and explores how they make sense of the term migrant
   itself. Building on the analysis of life histories of participants, this
   paper outlines a temporal approach that gives primacy to their
   subjective time. Findings suggest that the experience of migration
   itself plays a marginal role in the decision to mobilize for migrants'
   rights: friendships, family and community histories, experiences at
   work, ties with the local movement area provide complementary or
   alternative sites that trigger participation. Bridging the biographical
   and temporal dimensions, this work explores the internal reasons and
   meanings that sustain participation, beyond externally imposed labels
   that trap participants in the eternal present of migration. The temporal
   approach proposed complements the literature on migrants' collective
   action, which has generally privileged a focus on space, and has wider
   implications for the study of activism by marginalized and precarious
   actors.},

Title = {Party selectors, voters, and the choice of productive representatives
   under different types of list proportional representation},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {85},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Do party selectors or voters choose more productive politicians?
   Selectors may promote quality candidates and have an informational
   advantage over voters, but quality need not be the key criterion for
   nominations, and voters may be sufficiently informed to correct inferior
   decisions. We empirically examine whether the type of principal
   responsible for the selection affects individual parliamentary work
   (attendance, bills, amendments, questions, speeches). Flexible-list
   proportional representation systems are both interesting and
   analytically useful in this context, since seats within parties are
   first allocated to candidates reaching a certain number of personal
   votes, while any remaining seats are awarded based on the pre-electoral
   list rank. This allows us to compare three types of elected candidates:
   selector-chosen, voter-chosen, and doubly-chosen representatives.
   Analysing data from the Czech Republic in the period between 2002 and
   2021, we find that voters have a stronger preference for candidates with
   high formal education than selectors. We do not find differences in
   parliamentary behaviour between selector-chosen and voter-chosen types.
   The results speak against a potential trade-off between giving voters
   more influence on within-party seat allocation and the quality of chosen
   representatives.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis study tests the idea that neighborhoods on the periphery
   of large U.S. university campuses are socially disorganized and thus
   higher in crime relative to those that do not border university
   campuses. Social disorganization theory predicts that crime in these
   neighborhoods is elevated due to their high rate of residential
   mobility, relatively low socioeconomic status, and high levels of ethnic
   heterogeneity.MethodsTo test this hypothesis, data from the National
   Neighborhood Crime Study 2000 were analyzed. The data set contains a
   representative sample of U.S. neighborhoods with variables measured at
   the tract level. A series of t-tests note the difference in crime rate
   means for campus and non-campus areas, and ordinary least squares (OLS)
   regression analyses further test the hypothesis.ResultsWe find support
   for the main prediction using basic social disorganization models
   containing composite measures plus tract and city-level
   controls.ConclusionThe theoretical and practical implications of this
   research are discussed along with the study's limitations and the
   potential for future research.},

Abstract = {We study how transparent information about effort impacts the allocation
   of earnings in a dictator game experiment. We manipulate information
   about the respective contributions to a joint endowment that a dictator
   can keep or share with a counterpart. A humanomics framework for
   understanding human behavior predicts that subjects in the laboratory
   may give up money to follow learned social rules of conduct. We observe,
   accordingly, that many dictators adopt a meritocracy norm even if the
   receiver cannot observe them. However, receivers earn higher payments on
   average when transparency about effort provision for an earned endowment
   is complete. Under conditions of non-transparency, some dictators take
   advantage of the opportunity to send less because the receiver will not
   know what a fairer allocation would have been. Our results confirm
   previous findings about social distance and how subjects react to the
   possibility of disappointing observers. Our results also imply that
   outcomes for employees within organizations can be affected by the level
   of transparency for effort contributions.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how political actors engage in the
   politicisation of TTIP and EU-Mercosur agreements. By focusing on
   Atlantic Europe, Fortress Europe, and Moral Europe, the study reveals
   how proponents and opponents contribute to the construction of places
   and hierarchisation of trade partners. For TTIP, opponents highlighted
   the USA's relaxed regulatory standards, promoting a `fortress' narrative
   that emphasised regulatory differences. Proponents, however, framed the
   USA as an equal ally, advocating for an Atlantic Europe partnership. In
   contrast, the Mercosur agreement saw proponents, particularly in
   Germany, viewing Latin American nations as strategically significant,
   with the EU positioned as a moral authority countering China's
   influence. Opponents also used the Moral Europe frame to argue that
   engagement with Brazil could undermine the EU<acute accent>s ethical
   standards and damage its moral leadership. Ultimately, this study shows
   the paternalistic approach used by both proponents and opponents to
   frame the EU in relation to the Mercosur nations.},

Title = {The Blame Game: The Role of Media Environments and Political Discussion
   in Americans' Attribution of Blame for Interparty Hostility},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Polarization and hostility between political parties is a dominant
   feature of politics in the United States and is growing in many other
   democracies worldwide. Yet, there remain questions of who the public
   blames for this hostility and how those attributions of blame emerge.
   This study examines the role of partisan strength, political media
   exposure, and political discussion on blame for partisan hostility.
   Analyses of survey data (YouGov) collected during the 2020 U.S.
   presidential election suggest that political discussions play a
   particularly strong role in shaping attributions of blame, while
   partisan strength and political media exposure are relatively less
   influential. The data also indicate that who one talks to about politics
   matters for placing blame, as conversations with like-minded partisans
   lead to more blame placed on the out-party and less blame on the
   in-party, whereas political discussions with people who hold different
   views can temper out-party blame. Overall, findings suggest that
   political discussion may matter more than political media exposure for
   attributions of blame for partisan hostility.},

   Military Women in the Netherlands Armed Forces: Findings From an Action
   Research Project},
Journal = {ARMED FORCES \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 5},
Abstract = {The social inclusion of military women is negatively affected by
   dominant masculine norms. Often, military organizations try to promote
   inclusion through top-down policies. However, little is known about
   solutions military personnel themselves propose, and what is needed to
   implement those. Drawing on an action research project in the
   Netherlands Armed Forces, we identify four systemic collaborative
   requirements to implement initiatives aimed at improving inclusion: (a)
   awareness and recognition of women's (negative) experiences, (b) a safe
   environment for dialogue and joint ownership, (c) organizational trust,
   support and mandate, and (d) the implementation of interventions in the
   organizational structure. We discuss two paradoxes we identified (a)
   addressing inclusion in unsafe workplaces requires safety and (b)
   creating awareness about women's social inclusion without putting women
   in the spotlight. Our results show that a dialogic and collaborative
   approach is promising, especially to address the complexities that arise
   when trying to strengthen inclusion.},

   among Beirut's religiously devout youth},
Journal = {POLITICS AND RELIGION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 2},
Abstract = {This paper explores the following question: How does individual
   religiosity and attachment to a religious community relate to sectarian
   political loyalties or interpersonal prejudices in a post-conflict,
   institutionally sectarianized society? The paper explores this question
   through dialectic, participatory methods with youth involved in
   community-based youth associations with a religious component. The paper
   investigates how religiously devout youth in Lebanon conceptualize the
   personal and communal elements of their religiosity in relation to
   sectarian politics. In this way, the paper contributes to a study of
   social sectarianism, in which scholars are striving to understand what
   individuals mean when they speak about sect, and how discussions
   surrounding sect mask more complex underlying social realities. Overall,
   these accounts suggest that personal and social religiosity both
   positively influence anti-sectarian political outlook among
   participants, while other factors, such as the institutional
   sectarianization of public life and a history of violent conflict
   maintain participants' default attachment to co-sectarian networks in
   terms of routine, economic security, and communal belonging.},

Abstract = {Objective: Top two primary systems have been touted to increase
   moderation in politics. In a top two primary, the two candidates with
   the most votes continue on to the general election even if they are from
   the same political party. Candidates no longer have to cater to the
   extremes of their party in order to make it through the primary, so the
   thought is that candidates would be encouraged to be moderate throughout
   the election cycle to attract the median voter. Methods: Washington
   State adopted a top two primary system in 2008, which allows us to look
   at empirical evidence about whether the top two primary actually
   encourages moderation in politics. We analyze voting records of elected
   officials before and after the adoption of the top two primary. Results:
   We find evidence that the top two primary correlates with moderation in
   the voting behavior of elected officials, ceteris paribus. Conclusion:
   Policymakers may want to consider the structure of primaries and how
   they could be changed to help encourage moderation in the voting of
   elected officials.},

   South in an Age of Emerging Nationalisms: The Comparative Relevance of
   Trieste},
Journal = {EUROPEAN HISTORY QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {Between 1848 and 1867, at a time that is often considered to be central
   to Italian, German, and Slavic nation building, the Habsburg port city
   of Trieste witnessed a significant immigration from throughout Europe
   and the eastern Mediterranean. While the historiography of the city has
   focused on the Triestine entrepreneurial class, understandably described
   as cosmopolitan, little research has been conducted on the rest of the
   urban population, too often seen as polarized along distinct national
   affiliations. This article argues that such national allegiances are
   anachronistic and that `vulgar cosmopolitanism', national indifference,
   dynastic patriotism, and urban and regional allegiances better define
   the lived experiences of the majority of the population. Archival
   material, the applications for Austrian naturalization that thousands of
   foreigners submitted in the period studied here, shows the intense
   inter-ethnic engagement of those people who did not belong to the
   cosmopolitan trading community, who often proved to be insensitive to
   nationalist agitation and unaware of the existence of `nations'. This
   study of Habsburg Trieste at the time of nation building in Central and
   Southern Europe provides further elements that refute standard national
   narratives and classic interpretations of the development of
   nationalism. It also offers comparative evidence for global cities that
   have been integrated into mono-national states or have managed to avoid
   such integrational efforts.},

Abstract = {Does a politician's sex influence political budget cycles (PBCs)? We
   answer this question using a sample of Spanish municipalities from the
   Madrid region for the period 2010-2019. The Madrid region has a
   homogenous set of budget rules that allow consistent categorization of
   budget expenditure items as either ``mandatory{''} or
   ``non-mandatory{''} public services. After differentiating between
   smaller and larger municipalities, gender influence is studied along two
   dimensions: the mayor's sex and the share of women in government. Our
   findings include, in regard to mandatory spending in smaller
   municipalities, that gender-balanced governments induce PBCs. In larger
   municipalities, when the share of women in government is above 60\%,
   electoral spending is increased by up to 10\% of an average municipal
   budget for mandatory spending, and up to 2.2\% for non-mandatory. These
   findings are generally supported in a mixed-gender close election
   analysis.},

Abstract = {This paper examines attacks on higher education in Palestine through the
   lens of siege warfare. Focusing on attacks directed against Kadoorie
   campus in the West Bank city of Tulkarem, it argues that the combination
   of military, infrastructural, industrial and administrative tactics
   which have been used to isolate and enclose the campus; raid, injure,
   maim and kill people and animals; destroy property and key physical
   defences; degrade natural resources vital to its survival; disrupt
   university life and educational routines; and erode the physical and
   mental capacities of its students and staff over time, are not only
   illustrative of siege warfare but of ongoing and continuous attacks on
   Palestinian futures in the present. In so doing, this paper seeks to
   advance cross-disciplinary conversations on the spatial-temporal
   dynamics of modern siege warfare, and to draw more direct attention to
   the strategic confluence that exists between settler colonial violence
   and siege warfare in practice.},

Abstract = {There has been a plethora of insightful critical approaches to studying
   borders, but many still produce versions of borders that replicate
   essentialist readings of the border. In this paper, I draw out the
   tensions in critical accounts of bordering practices by demonstrating
   that borders are implicitly essentialised, and this has consequences for
   how they may be resisted. Critical approaches frequently conceive of
   borders as sites of power and resistance; I argue that these concepts
   have significant potential for political mobilisation, and that this
   should be capitalised upon. I make the case for using Spivak's logic of
   `strategic essentialism' when understanding borders, in order to
   foreground political resistance to bordering practices whilst allowing
   for a greater degree of conceptual clarity without the loss of
   criticality. Furthermore, rendering essentialisations as explicit rather
   than implicit serves to aid scholars themselves; this allows for
   reflexive acknowledgements of positionalities, reinforcing criticality
   in border studies.},

Abstract = {Since the global financial crisis of 2008, the level of perceived
   corruption in Italy has risen markedly, diverging significantly from the
   perceived corruption of other high-income countries and from the
   corruption as experienced. We propose that newspapers, in order to
   maximize their profits, have given directed emphasis to episodes of
   political corruption, which has contributed to the increase in perceived
   corruption. The consequence has been loss of parliament's credibility
   and a deterioration in the quality of the Italian political class.},

Title = {When citizens legalize drugs},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {85},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The demand for drug legalization is remarkably heterogeneous across
   countries and over time. A theory is presented to show that ruling
   politicians can influence this demand by choosing the level of
   enforcement of drug laws which will influence their exposure to drug use
   and their views on legalization. If legalization has, overall, expected
   social benefits, politicians opposed to it will adopt a higher level of
   law enforcement than politicians in favor. In this case, the level of
   law enforcement is excessive with respect to the optimal level. If
   instead, legalizing the drug has overall expected social costs, then the
   opposite will be the case. The examples of the Netherlands and the US
   are used to test the model.},

Abstract = {When aid professionals adopt high tech pilot projects, ignorance, blind
   faith, misplaced trust, and authentic expertise all come into play.
   Based on ethnographic research in Jordan, I examine how a refugee aid
   organisation produces and applies a blockchain pilot. Innovative pilots
   help international aid organisations attract and maintain their funding
   sources and reputations. I argue that The Blockchain Pilot is `conjured'
   as a product to be promoted to a marketplace of aid donors. `Conjurings'
   are the spectacles and magical appearances that draw an audience of
   investors. Ethnographic research suggests that conjurings drive
   capitalist markets. Rather than just requiring knowledge and expertise,
   I argue that conjurings entail key forms of ignorance: (i) confusion,
   (ii) illusion, (iii) disappearance, and (iv) misdirection. This
   ignorance is both strategic and inadvertent. Ignorance, just like
   knowledge, is shaped by hierarchical power relations. The organisation's
   experimental adoption of a blockchain database system benefits some
   stakeholders (innovators, private partners) more than others (local aid
   workers and refugees). The conjuring of the pilot is what justifies the
   adoption of blockchain, even though a simple database would have
   sufficed.},

Abstract = {In this article, we suggest that the ideological cultural forces explain
   the differences in journalism practices in Western and Muslim majority
   countries (MMC). It is argued that the norms, values, and the deep
   political culture of the West and MMC have been materialized leading to
   different types of journalism practices. The statistical analysis of
   11,246 interviews from twenty four Western and MMC conducted as part of
   the second wave of Worlds of Journalism Study demonstrates that
   journalists' perception of influences, editorial autonomy, and
   journalistic roles reflect clear varied patterns, which resemble the
   overall cultural lines that shape their journalistic ideology. This
   article, we argue, has extended the hierarchical model of influences to
   embrace the wider regional cultural lines that avoid the trap of
   national media systems-centrism. Furthermore, it refutes the dominance
   of a global Western monoculture and, in turn, a singular global
   journalism practice.},

Abstract = {In this article, we explore refugees' countervisuality, an emancipatory
   protest against the visuality of border watchers. Focusing on the social
   media campaign `Now You See Me, Moria', led by refugees in the Moria
   camp on the Greek island of Lesvos, we examine their digital rights
   claims against camp conditions and the EU-funded new Closed Controlled
   Access Centre. By analysing refugee-produced images and captions shared
   online, we unpack how refugees challenge the Greek authorities' watching
   out for, of, and over refugees. Our findings indicate a power struggle
   wherein the authorities employ invisibilisation to shield the camp from
   external scrutiny while hypervisibilising and disciplining refugees
   inside the camp, proudly advertised and visibilised to the wider public
   as exemplary. We clarify how refugees strive to look back, be seen, and
   be recognised by a transnational audience in their just call for
   decriminalisation and humanisation, countering the authorities'
   visuality regime. We conclude by discussing the significance of
   emancipating our ways of seeing refugees from an anti-democratic
   visuality regime imposed by state authorities.},

Abstract = {We examine the house price convergence across 12 OECD countries over the
   period 1905-2016. Using novel quantile unit root tests which allow for
   smooth breaks via a Fourier expansion series, we find that nine
   countries show the presence of relative house price convergence at all
   the quantiles. Focusing on several specific quantiles, 11 countries have
   significant convergence tendencies. Moreover, there are four definite
   patterns related to shocks in the relative house prices across
   quantiles.},

Title = {The interactive effect of geopolitical risk and natural resource rent on
   political instability: Evidence from Ghana},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {BackgroundAccording to economists, political instability is regarded as
   a serious malaise harmful to economic development, which results in
   frequent switches of policies, creating instability to impede economic
   performance. The widespread political instability in many developing
   countries, along with its harmful effects on social welfare and economic
   performance, has heightened the interest of policymakers and economists
   in understanding the factors that contribute to political instability to
   inform better policy formulation. It is therefore imperative to examine
   the interactive effect of geopolitical risk and natural resource rent on
   political instability to provide strong empirical grounds for policy
   implementation.ObjectivesThis study employs a long time series dating
   from the period of 1824-2020 to examine how natural resource rent and
   geopolitical risk influence political instability in Ghana. First, we
   examine long-run effects using linear methods. Second, we employ
   nonparametric methods to investigate the nonlinear link between natural
   resource rent and political instability as well as between geopolitical
   risk and political instability.MethodsThe study applied linear methods
   and nonparametric methods to historical time series data dating from the
   period of 1824-2020.ResultsThe results from the linear methods show that
   the interaction of natural resource rent and geopolitical risk exerts a
   positive and larger impact on political instability compared to their
   separate effects. The results from the nonparametric methods show a weak
   nonlinear link between these variables (i.e., natural resource rent,
   geopolitical risk, and political instability), although consistent with
   the linear long-run results, the links are positive.ConclusionOverall,
   the results demonstrate that the observed positive relationship between
   natural resource rent and political instability is not just a recent
   phenomenon but holds for over more than 100 years in Ghana. Therefore,
   to attain a stable political environment, both long- and short-term
   policies on political stability should be formulated.},

Abstract = {We investigate whether the provision of information about the structure
   of public spending influences the public's preferences in this regard.
   Using experimental data from a survey of 1800 Polish citizens, we
   uncover large misperceptions about the allocation of public spending.
   Respondents consistently underestimate the share of spending allocated
   to pensions, while overestimating the share allocated to environmental
   protection and public administration. However, when informed about the
   real structure of public spending, citizens express substantially
   different preferences for spending cuts or increases in some areas. The
   differences are particularly pronounced in those categories where
   beliefs about the size of spending are most distorted, with one
   exception - the treatment has minimal effect on the strong opposition to
   spending on public administration. In addition, we show that the
   provision of information improves the initially low assessment of
   government efficiency.},

Title = {Equilibrium communication in political scandals},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {85},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We present a formal model in which elite communication and voters'
   beliefs during a political scandal emerge as a communication
   equilibrium, determined by the severity of the accusations and the
   degree of media scrutiny. The prediction of our model is that
   incumbents' use of denials can garner support even when they face the
   possibility of evidence showing their guilt. In contrast, public
   apologies increase approval - compared to denial - only when accusations
   are not very serious and are likely to be proved. Results from a large
   survey experiment corroborate these predictions. In order to explore how
   changes in the information environment shapes the communication
   equilibrium, we estimate the structural parameters of our model and
   conduct counterfactual simulations. We find that increasing media
   scrutiny leads to asymmetric effects on incumbent communication with
   politicians who are the best at covering up evidence actually benefiting
   from increased scrutiny.},

   reconsidering the mobilisation towards the EU of two German L \&
   auml;nder, Bavaria and Baden-W \& uuml;rttemberg, over a 30-year period
   (1992-2022). Refining its traditional usage as a catch-all concept, we
   deploy a novel typology of layers of paradiplomatic activity, in order
   to unpack the inherent dynamics of substate engagement with the EU and
   explore the implications of paradiplomacy on intergovernmental relations
   in Germany. We find little difference between Bavaria and Baden-W \&
   uuml;rttemberg in the dominant mode of interaction with the federal
   government resulting from paradiplomacy, the cooperative mode, though
   modes of interaction differ across the layers of paradiplomatic
   activity, ranging from more active cooperation in the policy space
   through to benign neglect on cross-border cooperation and on regional
   identity promotion.},

Abstract = {Disinformation concerns have heightened the importance of regulating
   content and speech in digital communication environments. Perceived
   risks have led to widespread public support for stricter control
   measures, even at the expense of individual speech rights. To better
   understand these preferences in the US context, we investigate public
   attitudes regarding blame for and obligation to address digital
   disinformation by drawing on political ideology, libertarian values,
   trust in societal actors, and issue salience. A manual content analysis
   of open-ended survey responses in combination with an issue salience
   experiment shows that political orientation and trust in actors
   primarily drive blame attribution, while libertarianism predominantly
   informs whose obligation it is to stop the spread. Additionally,
   enhancing the salience of specific aspects of the issue can influence
   people's assessments of blame and obligation. Our findings reveal a
   range of attributions, underlining the need for careful balance in
   regulatory interventions. Additionally, we expose a gap in previous
   literature by demonstrating libertarianism's unique role vis-a-vis
   political orientation in the context of regulating content and speech in
   digital communication environments.},

Title = {Voters ` influence on local tax policy},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {85},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In a well-functioning democracy, citizens can influence public policy
   through voting. By voting prospectively, voters may aim to select
   politicians that make policies in line with their preferences, and, by
   voting retrospectively, they may reward or punish politicians for their
   performance. To what extent voters actually influence policy is unclear,
   especially in local government, where many impediments to policy
   responsiveness may exist. Moreover, voters may realize that their
   influence on public policy is negligible and vote expressively instead
   of instrumentally. We investigate a key area in public policy, tax
   policy, using panel data on municipalities in the Netherlands in the
   period 1998 -2021. We find that changes in the political color of the
   municipal council on average do not lead to changes in tax levels or tax
   distribution. However, incumbents that lower taxes fare better at the
   polls than incumbents that moderately increase taxes. Interestingly,
   strong tax increases do not lead to more severe electoral punishment,
   and punishment does not seem to differ between left-wing and right-wing
   incumbents. Our results suggest that expressive voting plays an
   important role. People may vote left-wing and express their identity as
   charitable persons, and then punish incumbents who actually raise taxes.},

Journal = {ECONOMICS \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1664-1674},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Simple majority rule disregards the interests of the losing minority;
   their vote does not affect the outcome. When vote outcomes are narrow,
   close to 50\% of voters, the concerns of a significant part of the
   voters are disregarded. This increases polarization in the population
   and endangers democracy. This paper proposes a new procedure for
   political decisions by referendums. The Flexible Decision Rule formally
   takes into account the percentage of voters accepting or rejecting a
   proposal. The higher the share y of voters accepting it, the more
   strongly the proposal is to be put into reality; the lower y is, the
   less strongly the proposal is to be put into reality. This procedure
   explicitly considers the concerns of both the supporters and the
   opponents thus raising the fairness of the vote procedure. In contrast
   to majority voting, each vote marginalizes the outcome and therefore
   raises the incentive to participate in the vote increase.},

Abstract = {At the 2010 UNFCCC Conference in Canc \& uacute;n, migration as a
   consequence of climate change entered the Canc \& uacute;n Adaptation
   Framework. It did so in a specific way, being framed as an adaptation
   strategy to climate change. The International Organisation for Migration
   (IOM) backed the framing of migration as an adaptation early on and
   pushed for its inclusion in Canc \& uacute;n. Through the analysis of
   121 documents and six expert interviews, this article traces how IOM's
   identity and interest shape how the organisation deploys the adaptation
   framing. Climate migration is traditionally situated beyond IOM's
   mandate; however, the organisation was present in the institutional
   process through which the adaptation framing emerged and now carries out
   operational projects related to the topic. This article shows how IOM
   uses the adaptation framing to reassert its own aspiration to manage
   climate migration and assert itself as the dominant migration agency.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveIn this article, we empirically examine the relationship
   between personalism and employing purging or cooptation as regime elite
   management techniques. Much of the literature suggests that there is a
   close relationship between personalism and the use of violence to
   maintain power, and thus suggests a connection between personalism and
   violent purges.MethodsUsing data from 109 autocracies from 1946 to 2008,
   we employ a seemingly unrelated negative binomial regression
   estimationResultsWe find that personalist regimes are not more likely to
   engage in purges when compared to other regimes. Further, the results
   suggest that personalist regimes are not more likely to rely on purges
   as an elite management strategy. In fact, our analysis suggests that
   personalism as a regime attribute (rather than as an institutional type)
   is associated with less (not more) use of purges and that personalism
   tends to be more associated with the use of cooptation than
   purges.ConclusionWe offer an explanation for these findings and suggest
   that future research should focus on the characteristics of the autocrat
   as a political agent when explaining the propensity to engage in
   different elite management techniques.},

Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {113},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Why do some countries make the costly decision to relocate their capital
   city? Existing research offers four general explanations for this
   momentous action: administrative functionality, economic development,
   environmental degradation, and national integration. We offer a less
   sanguine, political explanation: capital relocations offer autocratic
   leaders a way to mitigate different security threats, including coups,
   popular protests, and foreign interventions. Using original data on
   capital relocations in 202 polities after 1789, we test several
   implications of our argument, at different levels of analysis. First, we
   show that autocracies are much more likely to relocate their capitals
   than democracies. Second, using different indicators of internal and
   external threats, we find that autocracies more likely relocate their
   capitals when breakdown is looming. Third, running subnational analyses,
   we find evidence that capitals are relocated to smaller cities and areas
   less susceptible to urban development.},

Abstract = {In the 1980s, debate over inflation and unemployment in Australia
   promised to lead to new institutional priorities based on revised,
   corporatist principles. However, labour's functional capacity to
   influence policy, particularly anti-inflation policy, evaporated during
   the neoliberal era. Recently, new contradictions in the economy have
   emerged (as well as a new mode of accumulation, with altered production
   demands and political pressures), exposing lessons that remain unlearned
   from the prior stagflation years and permanent problems and incapacities
   for the contemporary polity.},

Title = {Infrastructure, time and labour: movement and suspension along the
   Abidjan-Lagos corridor},
Journal = {TERRITORY POLITICS GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 12},
Abstract = {Africa's renewed push towards infrastructure development brought with it
   new forms of territorialisation tied to both capital and labour.
   Infrastructures are expected to connect specific African hubs to global
   trade flows, promote industrialisation and increase employment rates,
   yet they often struggle to fulfil said promises. We explore the
   relationship between Africa's `infrastructure turn' and changing labour
   relations through the case of the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor in West Africa.
   Drawing from critical infrastructure studies and broader work in labour
   geography, we use the concept of suspension as a lens to illuminate a
   variety of processes - occurring across varied temporalities and scales
   - that are imbricated in the construction of different forms of
   infrastructural labour. We posit that infrastructure development as
   currently structured simultaneously (i) reinforces geopolitical
   inequities in the division of labour in the design and implementation of
   infrastructure projects; (ii) fosters competition amongst states for
   value and trade capture; and (iii) prompts contestation and disavowal in
   the context of the construction of specific projects. These three
   distinct, yet inter-related ways in which infrastructure development
   entangles with labour dynamics highlight that the work of imagining and
   crafting infrastructural promise creates pathways for novel, and often
   contested, configurations of labour relations.},

Title = {Containing the intertidal island: Negotiating island
   onto-epistemological visibility and plurality},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {113},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article departs from the author's own critical ethnographic
   vignettes in Eastern Indonesian islands, suggesting that islands have
   not only often been constructed around colonial paradigms of smallness
   and remoteness but have been framed as `islands' in an attempt to
   contain the powerful political agency of locales mastering mobility,
   multi-culturalism, and permeability. Here, the tidalectics of
   (intertidal) islands is embodied by bagian: house streams, living
   matrices neither sea nor land. These island nerves are not just central
   and controversial features of aquaculture; they ultimately mirror
   kinship relations, as entanglements that regulate sociality and
   conviviality. This article explores islands as thriving nerve centres of
   relations and circulation. Local notions of `being' and `belonging' that
   generate specific conceptualisations of spaces as places are central to
   how islands are experienced: a complex and dynamic realm of relations
   that string out, instead of being a container encompassing fixed places
   and/or fixed movement patterns. This has consequences for how we study,
   describe, and theorise geopolitical and politico-ecological matters in
   marine and island environments. The belittlement of islands dominates in
   regional politics and environmental policymaking in Indonesia and
   elsewhere, where islands and sea-based societies are either considered
   marginal or not considered at all. Actual political and ecological
   relations and interdependencies of marine and island peoples, that link
   places but are not confined to places, can be overshadowed in the
   assumptions of socioenvironmental approaches to island environments.
   Daily circulations do not take place `in the margins' but in a thriving
   mesh of movements and relations across and beyond the transboundary
   spaces of landsea binaries.},

Abstract = {One prominent criticism of luck egalitarianism is that it requires
   either shameful revelations or otherwise problematic declarations by the
   state toward those who have had bad brute luck. Relational
   egalitarianism, by contrast, is portrayed as an alternative that
   requires no such revelations or declarations. I argue that this is
   false. Relational equality requires the state to draft
   anti-discrimination laws for both state and private action. The ideal of
   relational egalitarianism requires these laws to be asymmetric, that is
   to allow affirmative action for disadvantaged groups while prohibiting
   affirmative action for advantaged groups. Hence, the state needs to make
   a public declaration on which groups are privileged and which are
   underprivileged; and individuals need to reveal whether they belong to
   groups officially declared underprivileged. These declarations are no
   more problematic in this case than in the case of luck egalitarianism.},

Title = {Investing in friends: The role of geopolitical alignment in FDI flows},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {83},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Firms and policy makers are increasingly looking at friend-shoring to
   make supply chains less vulnerable to geopolitical tensions. We test
   whether these considerations are shaping FDI flows, using
   investment-level data on over 300,000 instances of greenfield FDI
   between 2003 and 2022. Estimates from a gravity model, which controls
   for standard push and pull factors, show an economically significant
   role for geopolitical alignment in driving the geographical footprint of
   bilateral investments. This result is robust to the inclusion of
   standard bilateral drivers of FDI - such as geographic distance and
   trade flows - and the strength of the effect has increased since 2018,
   with the resurgence of trade tensions between the U.S. and China.
   Moreover, our results are not limited to greenfield FDI, but hold also
   for M\&As.},

Title = {Scientific nationalism and museums of the future in Germany and the UAE},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {113},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Nationalist visions of the future are articulated through the language
   and logic of science. This article extends political geography research
   on the future by examining ``scientific nationalism{''} expressed at two
   museums of the future in Germany and the UAE: Berlin's Futurium and
   Dubai's Museum of the Future. The techno-science ideals narrated in the
   museums are projected as planetary stories about building common futures
   through science, technological innovation, and concern for the
   environment, but fundamentally reinforce nationalist ideals and
   aspirations about their nations' success and prosperity in the future.
   In Germany and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), nationalist discourses
   celebrate science and technology - and technoscientific prowess is
   framed in the two museums of the future as holding the key to solving
   planetary challenges like the climate crisis. But in ``technowashing{''}
   social, political, and environmental challenges, they reflect a
   conservative approach to centering technology-centered questions about
   the future, while working to persevere the energy-intensive, capitalist
   political economy that defines their present. By projecting these
   extractive and nationalist presents into the future, the two
   future-themed museums illustrate how the future animates nationalist
   visions not just through stories of survivance, but also through stories
   of science.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {83},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The past decade has witnessed an increase in populist movements across
   the world. Some of those movements have gained strong political support
   and formed populist governments promising new sets of economic and
   fiscal policies. This raises the pertinent policy question: how do such
   populist governments influence fiscal policy outcomes? We approach this
   question by looking at the case of Poland which according to several
   recent studies has experienced the highest level of populist rhetoric in
   recent years. We performed two types of analyses. First, standard time
   series estimations of fiscal sustainability parameters that are typical
   for literature on fiscal sustainability, for both full sample and
   rolling -windows. Second, a counter -factual analysis using the
   synthetic control method (SCM) which is a useful complementary framework
   for our analysis of populists' economic performance. Overall, our
   estimates suggest that in the period of 2016-2019 fiscal sustainability
   parameters were the lowest since Poland joined the EU in 2004. The SCM
   analysis, in turn, showed that populist PiS fiscal policies might have
   been viable compared to the counter -factual data. At the same time, we
   also noted sensitivity of SCM across several dimensions and conclude
   that such sensitivity analysis might be useful or even necessary in
   future studies on populism.},

Title = {Was Bolsonaro's 2018 electoral victory an institutional accident?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Presidential Elections are critical moments for polyarchical systems,
   particularly in contexts of high social tension. In this regard, the
   2018 presidential election in Brazil, which used a two-round system, is
   a significant case study. Intriguingly, the most divisive candidates
   went to the second round. Was this an institutional accident? Pairwise
   and positional voting procedures embody different generalizations of a
   majoritarian credo that underpins such elections. The paper mobilizes
   both perspectives and, using representative survey data, reconstructs
   the top four preferences of the Brazilian electorate a week before the
   election. The analysis reveals that the electoral winner, Jair Messias
   Bolsonaro - despite being a divisive candidate - was a Condorcet Winner
   and a Borda Winner. Conversely, the second-round loser, Fernando Haddad,
   was a Condorcet Loser. Thus, Bolsonaro's victory in 2018 was not an
   institutional accident. The paper also explores possible alternative
   scenarios under different feasible sets of candidates through
   simulations, contributing to a deeper understanding of the role of
   decision procedures in critical junctures.},

Title = {Anti-corruption campaign and economic growth in Chinese cities: The
   dichotomous mechanism of network-based political competition},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {83},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {I study how economic growth in Chinese cities responds to the recent
   anti-corruption campaign, focusing on a novel mechanism of network-based
   political competition, whereby the removal investigated officials
   creates job vacancies and triggers promotion competition within the
   social network of the investigated officials for the vacancies. Such a
   network-based competition hinges on the premise that (1) some positions
   are persistently occupied by certain networks, and (2) high-ranked
   officials help low-ranked ones to achieve promotion within the network,
   two facts that are well supported by the evidence. Using a
   difference-in-differences and an instrumental variable approach, I find
   that cities' GDP growth rate registers a 2.5-percentage-point increase
   following the investigation of the city leader's connected officials.
   City leaders create a healthier business environment, attract
   investments, and increase government spending, while some longterm
   issues, including innovation, education, and environmental protection,
   are compromised, indicating the dichotomous nature of political
   competition.},

Abstract = {We check the role of time-zone difference on offshoring of service tasks
   when the skill of labors varies between the partner countries. We frame
   a model where partner countries are located in non-overlapping time
   zones, and the skill level of the partner-country labors is lower. In
   our model, service production is divided into two sequential stages, and
   output is a supermodular function of the skill of labors and time. The
   problem of the producers is to choose between domestic production and
   offshoring. Domestic production employs high-skill labors though the
   time management is inefficient. On the other hand, offshoring to a
   non-overlapping time zone helps to work round the clock and reduce the
   cost, but the lower expertise of skilled labor lowers the output. In
   such a framework, we check conditions for beneficial offshoring. The
   condition derived in our analysis provides combinations of skill and
   time that can make offshoring beneficial. Results show that offshoring
   across time zones is beneficial even when the complexity of stages of
   production vary. However, only the relatively less-critical task is
   offshored. We further find that availability of domestic low-skill labor
   does not benefit the firm, while foreign low-skill labor may be
   beneficially utilized through time-zone exploitation.},

Abstract = {This article documents the struggle of pro-choice nongovernmental
   organizations, Women on Web, Women on Waves, and Aid Access, to provide
   reproductive healthcare information and procedures, including medical
   abortion, to people around the world seeking to exercise their human
   rights to physical health and autonomy irrespective of state legal
   structures. These organizations seek to affirm and share factual
   reproductive health knowledge and care approved by the World Health
   Organization including safe and approved medical abortions. Women on
   Waves and Women on Web use international waters and the Internet as
   common spaces to exercise freedom over bodily autonomy. Specifically,
   Women on Web and Aid Access use the Internet as a digital imaginary
   extension of physical international spaces. The authors argue that a
   transparent and open Internet, as an imagined common, is essential to
   countering ongoing processes of privatization of international spaces
   and restrictions on reproductive health rights. Under this framework,
   the status of abortion care websites to remain accessible and avoid
   censorship is a bellwether for both net neutrality and feminist
   geopolitics. The struggle for an open Internet has broad implications
   for reproductive health, bodily autonomy, and the free exchange of
   ideas.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {83},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The development of the political system of countries is noisy, but in
   the longer run a strong relation to the economy emerges in the
   cross-country data for income, growth, and the main democracy indices.
   Two main theories explain these relations: (alpha) starts from the
   strong correlation between income and democracy, seeing income as the
   causal variable. It is the democratic transition, which is the political
   part of the theory of the grand transition. (beta) starts from the much
   weaker correlation between democracy and economic growth, seeing
   democracy as the causal variable. This is a part of the
   primacy-of-institutions theory, where the political system is a key
   institution. The discussion needs (lambda) a link-relation between
   growth and income. It connects the (alpha) and (beta) theories, so that
   one may explain the other. The analysis looks at all six possible
   univariate relations between the three variables using kernel
   regressions on a large, unified data set. This method gives a clear
   picture. The strong alpha-relation can indeed explain the weak
   beta-relation as spurious, but the weak beta-relation predicts that the
   alpha-relation is very weak. Thus, (alpha) encompasses (beta), but not
   vice versa.},

Title = {Measuring County Election Administration in the United States},
Journal = {ELECTION LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {258-276},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Existing data are not granular enough to measure the full range of
   barriers people face in voting because many measures of election
   administration (e.g., the Election Performance Index) are available only
   at the state level. Overreliance on state data can conceal important
   substate variation in election practices, as U.S. counties administer
   elections. The idea is that all Americans, especially more disadvantaged
   people, should be more likely to vote when they live in places with
   better voter access in terms of election laws (e.g., early voting,
   absentee/mail voting) and places that more efficiently administer
   elections. We develop the index ranking every county nationwide as very
   high, high, average, low, or very low in terms of their capacity to
   conduct elections using an interval-level scale. The CEA index is
   validated by comparing it with the available state-level data over time
   (from the years 2016, 2018, and 2020). Demographic population data and
   regression analysis are used to understand the features of counties with
   more or less efficient election administration. Results show that more
   urban areas generally have lower performance levels in conducting
   elections, but not in all cases, and less affluent and high Latino and
   Black communities generally have lower levels as well. The empirical
   results expose significant inequalities in election administration
   performance based on demographics and wealth, as well as general
   improvement in the conduct of elections over time, counter to claims of
   electoral irregularities in 2020.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine the function of territorial representation
   by national cabinet ministers in multi-ethnic democracies. In
   particular, we observe whether ministers from regions with a specific
   identity shape a distinctive sense of representation in the national
   executive, and whether this depends on how political parties and the
   party system articulate it. Borrowing from Pitkin's four dimensions of
   political representation, we investigate the recruitment and role of
   ministers from the three distinct Spanish regions of the Basque Country,
   Catalonia and Galicia. This paper stresses that these ministers have
   played a distinctly territorial representative role in the national
   cabinet quite unlike that of ministers from other Spanish regions.
   Nevertheless, it is worth noting the poorest performance of Catalan
   ministers in relation to their Basque and Galician counterparts in terms
   of descriptive representation, levels of partisanship, survival rates
   and appointment to certain portfolios.},

   violence},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {111},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {I examine the relationship between interstate river conflicts and
   intrastate violence such as riots, demonstrations, and civil wars in
   multiple regions from 1900 to 2001. I argue that interstate
   disagreements over cross-border river basins create instabilities in
   water resources, which can increase the risks for intrastate conflict by
   creating unequal access to water resources across ethnic groups,
   displacing populations, and reducing water supplies for downstream
   states. I find that countries that experience more frequent and salient
   interstate conflicts over shared river basins face significantly higher
   risks for multiple forms of intrastate conflict, especially if the
   interstate conflicts involve water quantity rights in river basins.
   Consistent with the pathways described in the theory, water conflicts
   between countries increase intrastate conflict risks more for downstream
   than upstream states, for countries with ethnic dominance, and for
   countries experiencing large numbers of refugees and internally
   displaced people. These results help us understand cases like the Syrian
   civil war where water conflicts in the Tigris-Euphrates basin combined
   with drought and forced migration fueled grievances against the
   government.},

Title = {Global China in the American heartland: Chinese investment, populist
   coalitions, and the new red scare},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {111},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A specter is haunting the American heartland - the specter of global
   China. As US -China geopolitical tensions rise, China -related
   investments in US land have become ground zero for anti -China populist
   expressions. This article analyzes the role of Chinese land investment
   in the reconfiguration of local, inter -regional, and national politics.
   It examines geopolitical imaginaries of Chinese investment through a
   case study of Fufeng USA's agricultural land purchase in Grand Forks,
   North Dakota. The specter of a Chinese -owned corporation in the Upper
   Midwest ignited fears of economic statecraft and espionage among
   residents, interregional coalitions, and national politicians alike. In
   this context, the circulation of anti -China red scare discourses served
   to unify politically disparate actors across networked scales. The
   article intervenes by analyzing an anti -China red scare within an
   agricultural region and extending global China conceptual frameworks to
   Global North contexts through regional and scalar analyses. This red
   scare articulates as a land -based formation wherein anti -China
   discourse circulates in response to fears over the loss of agricultural
   space and sovereignty to foreign powers, in effect disciplining
   transnational capital. The analysis, furthermore, illuminates the
   undersized role of Chinese investment in US agriculture, thereby
   demystifying perceptions of threat embodied in geopolitical imaginaries
   of Chinese investment.},

Title = {Protest and repression in China's digital surveillance state},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 31},
Abstract = {Autocrats around the world are making unprecedented investments in new,
   digital surveillance technologies to monitor their societies as well as
   to identify and repress pockets of dissent. Using an original dataset of
   local procurement of digital surveillance technologies, merged with
   micro-data on collective action events, I examine the logic and
   motivation for the digital surveillance buildup in China, the bellwether
   of digital dictatorships. I find that localities do indeed tend to
   allocate increased spending for digital surveillance in response to high
   volumes of collective action. Why citizens protest appears to be of less
   concern: protest claims do not have a significant impact on digital
   surveillance spending. However, how citizens protest makes a great deal
   of difference: more violent protests prompt significantly higher levels
   of investment in digital surveillance. This study's findings have
   important implications for understanding autocrats' evolving strategies
   of control in the digital age.},

Abstract = {If and how economic freedom is associated with environmental damage
   remains an open question. In this paper, I therefore combine data on
   greenhouse gas emissions and GDP per capita with the Economic Freedom of
   the World indices to test if economic freedom affects emissions. I do so
   in the context of estimating a standard Environmental Kuznets Curve in
   which economic freedom can both reduce overall levels as well as shift
   the shape of the curve. The results suggest that economic freedom
   reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also shifts the top point of the
   Kuznets Curve to the left.},

Abstract = {Following the repeal of the federal individual health insurance mandate,
   five states and D.C. adopted their own state-level individual mandates
   to counteract the potential negative consequences of the repeal. This
   study examines the actual changes in veterans' enrollments in private
   and Veterans Affairs (VA) insurance following the 2019 repeal. By
   analyzing data from 65,297 non-elderly veterans aged 18 to 64 in the
   U.S. between 2019 and 2021, we found that state-level individual
   mandates have positive effects on veterans' enrollments in private and
   VA insurance, but the effects vary depending on individual income
   levels. The state-level individual mandate successfully serves as a
   substitute for the federal mandate. The results imply that veterans in
   states without individual mandate policies are more likely to worry
   about health insurance premiums and medical bills, limiting access to
   health care and potentially worsening health outcomes. Thus, the
   Veterans Health Administration should endeavor to encourage more state
   governments to adopt individual mandate policies.},

Abstract = {Using newly collected data on ties between local politicians in Italy
   from 1985 onwards, this paper studies the relation between cross-party
   connections and future career prospects. Exploiting a
   difference-in-discontinuities design, I find that ruling coalition
   members connected with the leader of the opposition in local councils
   are twice as likely to be promoted to the local government. The results
   are confirmed with a number of placebo exercises. Interestingly, the
   effect of connections with the leader of the rivals disappears when I
   consider appointments to boards of state-owned enterprises or to other
   councils in which the party faces different politicians as opponents. A
   possible mechanism that may account for these results is that connected
   politicians act as political brokers and smooth the relationship between
   government and opposition. Finally, connected politicians are less
   educated than the average appointed official, indicating that political
   selection is negatively affected (Besley et al. in Econ J
   121(554):F205-F227, 2011).},

Title = {Chinese aid in Africa: Attitudes and conflict},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This study examines Chinese aid projects' impact on conflict and
   perceptions of China in 820 African districts from 2000 to 2012. We show
   that a 10\% increase in Chinese aid projects results in a 6\% increase
   in conflict incidents. This rise is mainly due to confrontations
   involving nonstate actors, such as militias and rebel groups, and
   clashes between these groups and government forces. Civilian attitudes
   towards China's presence do not drive this increase, as evidenced by
   both revealed and stated preferences. We find that Chinese aid does not
   provoke protests, riots, or strikes, nor does it amplify critical views
   among Africans regarding Chinese culture, resource extraction, or land
   acquisitions. Our evidence suggests that Africans attribute the rise in
   conflict to the interaction of resource influx and local politics,
   rather than to China itself, reflecting a discerning perspective on
   China's influence on the continent.},

Abstract = {The career prospects of politicians are crucial determinants of their
   policy choices. This paper studies the impact of promotion incentives on
   policy choices by analyzing data on prefecture officials and local land
   market dynamics in China from 2007 to 2017. Our findings indicate that a
   decrease in promotion prospects for prefecture party secretaries hampers
   their motivation to promote economic growth. This results in a decline
   in industrial land transactions. However, similar patterns are not
   observed among mayors. Further exploration reveals that officials
   experiencing a decline in prospects exhibit a negative stance toward
   economic growth, as evidenced by their annual working reports. This
   research sheds light on the nuanced relationship between political
   career incentives and policy outcomes in the context of local land
   markets.},

Title = {All politics are national: Partisan defection in national and

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},

Volume = {105},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {ObjectiveWhile they were once viewed as largely local or
   candidate-centered contests, recent American elections have come to be
   dominated by national forces such as presidential politics and
   partisanship. Prior research on voter behavior in this new era of
   nationalized politics, however, has largely focused on more high-profile
   contests and has not examined voter decision making across multiple
   levels of government.MethodsOur study uses cross-sectional (2006-2020)
   survey data from the Cooperative Election Study to explore the
   determinants of partisan loyalty and defection across both national and
   subnational American elections.ResultsWe find consistent evidence that
   citizens increasingly rely upon national forces-specifically
   partisan-ideological sorting and presidential approval-to make decisions
   about candidates up and down the ballot. We also find mixed evidence
   that evaluations of the national economy inform defection
   behavior.ConclusionThese findings indicate that the national political
   forces shape voter behavior in national and subnational contests in
   effectively identical ways. Thus, the evidence supports the notion that
   all (electoral) politics are now national.},

Abstract = {Do natural disasters affect election results? Some studies have shown
   that natural disasters negatively impact subsequent elections, while
   others do not. This study investigated the link between natural
   disasters and local elections using data from the Japanese prefectural
   governor elections for the years 1985-2015. A rich data set is available
   for prefectural governor elections in Japan that includes information on
   who won, the vote shares of all candidates, and when the election was
   held, among others. We found empirical evidence that the number of days
   between an election and most recent disaster before election positively
   impacted the vote share of the incumbent/successor. In other words, an
   incumbent/successor is likely to have less support in the election
   immediately following a disaster by the constituencies, but can get more
   support as time passes after the disaster. Moreover, political alignment
   with the central ruling parties positively affects the vote share of an
   incumbent/successor over time between an election and the most recent
   disaster. These results suggest a possibility that politicians seek
   popularity not through the implementation of proper disaster recovery
   policies but by taking advantage of their connection with central ruling
   parties, which may harm citizens' welfare in the long run.},

Abstract = {In August 1974, the Australian Labor Party Government under Prime
   Minister Gough Whitlam announced it had recognised the incorporation of
   the Baltic states into the Soviet Union de jure. Historical writing
   around this diplomatic recognition is scarce and sheds little light on
   why the policy was enacted. Using previously unavailable archival
   evidence, as well as other sources including testimony from Government
   and public service workers, this article demonstrates that the
   recognition was induced primarily by Whitlam, the Department of Foreign
   Affairs, and Sir James Plimsoll, Australia's ambassador to the Soviet
   Union. These actors were motivated by varying considerations. These
   included an adherence to realist foreign policy principles, concerns
   regarding Australian-Soviet bi-lateral relations, convictions around the
   legitimacy of Baltic self-determination, and ethnic prejudice against
   Australians of Baltic descent.},

Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {159-175},
Abstract = {This mixed-method study revolves around female victims' perspectives and
   voices concerning sexual harassment prevention measures in their
   workplaces. Two hundred and eighty-nine participants responded to
   questionnaires, in-depth questions, and interviews. Data were collected
   from various professionals who had experienced sexual misconduct at
   work. The research objectives were to investigate victims' perspectives
   of sexual harassment prevention and the effectiveness of related
   measures, to examine the impact of sexual harassment measures on
   work-related motivation, and to explore female employees' voices
   concerning reforms involving the implementation of sexual harassment
   prevention measures. The quantitative results reveal that the victims
   did not highly evaluate the effectiveness of sexual harassment
   prevention measures implemented at their workplaces. Also, the measures
   negatively impacted employees' work-related motivation. Qualitative data
   indicated that the victims strongly recommended positive changes in
   sexual harassment awareness education, sexual harassment laws, and
   women's protection policies to create an anti-sexual harassment working
   environment.},

Volume = {72},
Number = {5},
Abstract = {Exchange rate expectations are a crucial element in the main monetary
   models. Therefore, this paper analyses the mechanism behind their
   formation. To achieve this, we analyse traditional expectation models
   using data from the Su rvey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the
   CZK/ EUR currency pair. The data used cover one-year expectations in the
   period from January 2001 to December 2022, which are provided monthly by
   the Czech National Bank (CNB). The paper demonstrates the poor
   performance of the perfect expectation model. Furthermore, it
   demonstrates that traditional models, such as static, extrapolative,
   regressive and adaptive expectations, exhibit some explanatory power but
   lack robustness. The only traditional model that exhibits robustness is
   the model based on the UIP puzzle, which also outperforms all other
   traditional models when evaluated using error metrics. Based on these
   observations, the paper introduces a non-traditional model in which
   agents simply shift the current spot value by a constant into the
   future. This model displays robustness and outperforms the others.},

Abstract = {This article argues for the importance of reframing the history of
   school desegregation in the United States beyond Black and white and
   beyond the regional frames through which this history has been
   interpreted. In Western states, most Latino children attended schools
   segregated not by law but by custom starting in the early twentieth
   century; Latino students also encountered de facto segregation in the
   Eastern and Midwestern cities with large Puerto Rican populations by the
   1950s. Parents, students, advocates, and activists protested the
   inequality of educational outcomes for Latino children over many
   decades, developing distinctive strategies to address the combination of
   racial and language-based discrimination faced by Latino students. Yet,
   because they were marginalized in political debates in the 1960s and
   1970s and because most national-level historical scholarship on school
   desegregation focuses on Black and white participants, Latinos' role in
   this aspect of our national civil rights history has remained obscured.},

Abstract = {We examine the influence a self-interested social-media platform can
   have on election outcomes. Using the framework of the Condorcet Jury
   Theorem, we explore the effect of additional information via private
   messages from the platform, modeled through Bayesian persuasion. We
   establish conditions under which the platform can sway the majority
   voting outcome, assuming voters vote sincerely. Additionally, we
   demonstrate that the information disseminated by the platform can
   sometimes be biased in the opposite direction of the platform's
   interests.},

Title = {Intergroup Contact Versus Competitive Threat: Does Immigration Change
   Immigration Votes? Evidence From Switzerland Using Objective

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {ObjectiveGordon Allport's intergroup contact hypothesis and Herbert
   Blumer's competitive threat hypothesis have attracted a lot of attention
   in the social sciences and have influenced integration policies around
   the world. A valuable study within this field is of Brunner and Kuhn.
   Brunner and Kuhn investigated the causal effect of immigration on
   natives' attitudes toward immigrants in Switzerland using objective
   municipality-level panel data between 1970 and 2010 following an
   instrumental variable approach. In this article, we conceptually
   replicate and update the study of Brunner and Kuhn addressing two
   analytical limitations.MethodsWe use annual Swiss municipality-level
   panel data on the culturally similar and culturally different immigrant
   share as well as the results of national votes on immigration policies
   from 2010 to 2020 applying fixed effects with individual slopes panel
   regression models.Results and conclusionOur analysis confirms the notion
   that cultural competitive threat may be at work for culturally different
   migrants in Switzerland. Additionally, intergroup contact seems to
   foster immigration-friendly attitudes.},

Title = {What we Don't see: Uncovering intercommunal violence through remote
   sensing},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {116},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Earth observing remote sensing technology offers a pioneering method for
   gathering data on collective violence that would otherwise remain
   unseen, unreported, and unrecorded. However, it remains a critically
   underutilised tool in the academic study of conflict. This article
   demonstrates the value added of remote sensing by outlining a method
   that relies on publicly available satellite data of fires in conjunction
   with other satellite imagery to gain insight into bouts of intercommunal
   violence, which are subject to reporting bias. I use anomalous fire
   patterns as leads to identify potential conflict events and satellite
   images to determine the conflict relevance of fire detections by
   analysing structural damage and scorch marks. I illustrate the
   contribution of this method by applying it to two cases of intercommunal
   violence: one in Cameroon's Far North Region and the other in Ethiopia's
   Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region. I find 28 destroyed
   settlements in the former case, and 14 in the latter, most of which were
   previously unreported. Finally, the method has important academic and
   humanitarian use cases as a low-cost way of gaining near real-time and
   spatiotemporally accurate insight into the extent and spread of violence
   in conflict vulnerable areas.},

Abstract = {This paper will focus on sixteenth-century weaver and wedding singer
   Jonas Losch of Augsburg as a focal point for examining craftsmen in
   Germany who moonlighted as singers, offering both formal and informal
   entertainment in the streets, pubs, and other informal spaces of early
   modern German towns. Because songs were one of the few ways that
   artisans of lower status were able to make their voices heard, their
   songs were often political, socially critical, or even subversive,
   although many of these artisan singers also performed at weddings or in
   other non-political venues. In a process recognizable to a modern
   audience, sharing songs of protest provided a vehicle for building and
   solidifying group political identity and politicizing the spaces in
   which they were performed. The setting of political songs to familiar
   tunes associated with Protestant or Catholic identity increased the
   potential for eliciting emotional reactions and inflaming passions among
   listeners, which could lead to conflict. Because sound also penetrated
   windows, walls, and thresholds, songs could temporarily redefine spatial
   boundaries. The networks of artisan singers who wrote, copied, and
   shared these songs created political space for a lively public sphere of
   opinion among the artisan classes of the sixteenth and seventeenth
   centuries.},

Abstract = {A common concern about vote-by-mail in the United States is that mail-in
   ballots are sent to dead people, stolen by bad actors, and counted as
   fraudulent votes. Studying Washington state's vote-by-mail program, we
   link counted ballots and administrative death records to estimate the
   rate at which dead people's mail-in ballots are improperly counted as
   valid votes, using birth dates from online obituaries to address false
   positives. Among roughly 4.5 million distinct voters in Washington state
   (2011-2018), we estimate that there are 14 deceased individuals whose
   ballots might have been cast suspiciously long after their death,
   representing 0.0003\% of voters. Even these few cases may reflect two
   individuals with the same name and birth date, or clerical errors,
   rather than fraud. After exploring the robustness of our findings to
   weaker conditions for name-matching and the inclusion of deaths closer
   to Election Day, we conclude that counting dead people's ballots as
   votes seems extraordinarily rare in Washington's universal vote-by-mail
   system.},

Title = {Uneven development and the anti-politics machine: Algorithmic violence
   and market-based neighborhood rankings},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {116},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the role of supposedly objective algorithms in
   producing uneven urban spaces through market-based neighborhood
   rankings. Focusing on the Market Value Analysis (MVA), we argue that
   municipal governments' failure to explicitly account for the racialized
   and class-based production of urban space in ranking algorithms hinders
   their capacity to foster equitable and vibrant neighborhoods. Instead,
   these algorithms deepen existing inequalities and reinforce market-based
   approaches to neighborhood typologies and spatial organization,
   effectively serving as tools for capital accumulation. Through a
   comparative analysis of the Market Value Analysis (MVA) and historical
   Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) maps across 10 cities, we
   illustrate how the MVA preserves wealth while simultaneously producing
   poverty in certain areas to benefit affluent landowners. We argue that
   the MVA typology, presented under the guise of technological
   objectivity, functions as part of an anti-politics machine that
   depoliticizes and institutionalizes race- and class-based housing
   segregation. By positioning city residents as ``customers{''} and
   aligning government spending with market-driven priorities, the MVA
   algorithm places profit motives above the immediate needs of vulnerable
   communities. Consequently, it perpetuates and amplifies existing
   disparities in urban geographies, reinforcing racial capitalism through
   ostensibly ``objective{''} market-based approaches to public policy.
   Toward realizing a more equitable and just future, our findings
   challenge claims of the objectivity of technical planning products and
   instead elucidate the role algorithms can play in the differential
   valuation of urban territory.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesIn this article, we examine the extent to which respondents'
   support for conspiratorial claims depends on question format. Measuring
   conspiracy theory beliefs in the general population is challenging, and
   properly capturing these beliefs is necessary if we are to understand
   them.MethodsWe conducted a preregistered vignette experiment of Canadian
   respondents (N = 3,518) in February 2024. In our experiment, we
   introduced survey respondents to conspiratorial claims in one of three
   ways: (1) by asking them whether they support a conspiratorial claim
   directly through a Likert scale with the response set from very likely
   to not likely at all, (2) by offering respondents a binary choice
   between a conspiratorial claim and an alternative claim, and (3) by
   offering respondents a trichotomous choice between a conspiratorial
   claim, an alternative claim, and an equally likely option.ResultsWe find
   the trichotomous format produces the most conservative estimates of
   conspiracy endorsement, while the Likert format produces the most
   permissive estimates. In some cases, the percentage of respondents who
   endorsed conspiracy theories in the Likert questions was more than three
   times as high as in the trichotomous format, and in many cases was
   around twice as large.ConclusionDifferent question formats lead to
   substantially different estimates of conspiracy beliefs. While we
   believe that it is impossible to create completely bias-free questions
   measuring conspiracy belief, researchers must acknowledge the likely
   biases (in particular, social desirability bias and acquiescence bias)
   that may be present in their survey designs.},

   Public Opinion Manipulation Through Social Media in Indonesia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 11},
Abstract = {Coordinated influence campaigns on social media have become an
   increasingly important tool for political and economic elites to sway
   public opinion in their favor. As the study of this phenomenon has so
   far largely focused on traces of such campaigns on social media itself,
   we know relatively little about the people and networks implementing
   them. Furthermore, existing literature offers limited analytical handles
   to delineate and analyze different forms of influence operations. To
   address these challenges, we employ interviews with fifty-two members of
   the ``cyber troops{''} implementing such operations in Indonesia. On the
   basis of this material, we propose that three key features-being
   secretly funded, highly coordinated, and involving mostly anonymous
   accounts-distinguish cyber troops from other types of domestic influence
   operations. In Indonesia cyber troops involve transient, project-based
   collaborations among freelancing individuals, not coincidentally
   mirroring the character of the country's election campaigns. This
   rapidly growing industry is cementing the already oligarchic character
   of Indonesia's democracy.},

Abstract = {A common perception is that the deportation of immigrants results in
   less crime and increased immigration raises crime. Using a 2008 worksite
   raid in Postville, Iowa and a 2006 worksite raid in Marshalltown, Iowa
   as natural experiments, we use a synthetic control method to study how
   deportation impacts local crime. Because the Postville worksite raid was
   followed by increases in immigrant workers in 2009, we also analyze how
   increased immigration impacts crime. Our analysis of both deportations
   suggests the removal of immigrants increased violent crime and decreased
   property crime, at least in the short term. Estimated effects of the
   2009 inflow of immigrants suggest that new arrivals were accompanied by
   lower crime rates. Sensitivity analysis, however, suggests neither
   deportation nor increased immigration were the root causes of documented
   changes in crime. Rather, other latent factors influenced crime rates in
   Postville, Marshalltown, and other areas, irrespective of immigrant
   deportation or new immigrants. Our results imply major changes in
   immigration do not impact crime.},

Abstract = {In the following paper, we endorse the departure from traditional
   econometrics towards a more inclusive understanding of economic
   behavior. Humanomics, as championed by Vernon Smith and Bart Wilson,
   integrates cultural factors, transcending the limitations of
   quantitative models. We celebrate its potential for exploring emergent
   norms across diverse contexts and insights into philanthropy's role in
   institution building. Offering a friendly critique of experimental
   economics, we advocate for a broader conversation among scholarly
   traditions. Our paper emphasizes the importance of embracing complexity
   and diversity in economic science, positioning humanomics as a valuable
   framework for interdisciplinary dialogue and inspiring scholars to
   explore new perspectives, thereby fostering an enlightened and
   open-minded academic community.},

Abstract = {This paper presents three textual analysis algorithms: the Latent
   Dirichlet Algorithm, Word2Vec and CamemBERT. The first algorithm groups
   words from French newspaper articles about the European Central Bank
   (ECB) in eleven topic categories that can be reduced to two themes:
   purely economic and political. Word2Vec, helps up to construct a
   dictionary of positive and negative words. This dictionary is used to
   compute the tone of the medias. The last one involves Large Langage
   Models and returns a probability that a news is positive. We use it in a
   VAR model about monetary policy.},

Abstract = {The far-right identification of Jews with modernity has been noted by
   many scholars, some writing from a Marxist perspective, such as Enzo
   Traverso and Moishe Postone. Yet most analyses have fallen short of
   offering a properly dialectical account of antisemitism, one that will
   scrutinize the antinomies at the heart of the antisemitic discourse and
   trace their relations to the contradictions of modernity itself. In this
   paper, I will make modernity as movement the focus of the analysis.
   Modernity, philosophically underpinned by the Enlightenment, and
   politically ushered in by the French Revolution of 1789,{[}1]was seen by
   its reactionary and fascist opponents as both a time of great upheaval,
   constant change and social disruption; but also, as the setting up of an
   era of stasis and degeneration. It was paradoxically decried, sometimes
   simultaneously, as both helplessly nomadic and incurablysedentary. And
   in both respects ``the Jew{''} and ``the Jewish spirit{''} were often
   placed, no matter how spuriously, at the very centre of attacks. Qua
   ``wandering{''} or ``eternal,{''} the Jews were seen as embodying the
   spirit of restlessness and lack of roots, undermining tradition and
   fixed national and racial identities; theirdynamic role as
   revolutionaries, conspirators and rabble rousers was ritually denounced.
   Jews were also condemned, however, as a major obstacle to movement and
   expansion, the arch-enemies of imperialism, seeking to establish a realm
   of universal brotherhood, peace and egalitarianism. By attacking the
   Jews, reactionaries and fascists thus attempted to settle their scores
   with a modernity that they feared and loathed in equal measure. As
   historian Alon Confino incisively contended, at the heart of National
   Socialism lay the project of creating ``a world without Jews.{''} Here
   it will be argued that only a struggle to complete the revolution of
   1789 and follow the process of modernity through, a process comprising
   both movement and improvement, can bring about a world without
   antisemitism.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the role of parliament in the face of a
   constitutional crisis, drawing on Poland's experience from 2015-2023.
   The issue discussed focuses on the impact of changes to the judiciary
   and other key democratic institutions, which have resulted in Poland
   being perceived as a state with illiberal constitutionalism or
   authoritarian populism. The article emphasises the importance of
   analysing patterns and scenarios of constitutional crisis, pointing to
   the `avalanche effect' whereby changes in one country can affect other
   countries in the region. The paper focuses on the role of the parliament
   as a key democratic body responding to difficult challenges and attempts
   to curb violations of the rule of law in Poland. The research objective
   is to analyse the constitutional mechanisms conducive to the protection
   of the rule of law during periods of populist rule, and by analysing
   these aspects, the paper contributes to the debate on the condition of
   contemporary parliamentarism.},

   and sentiments. TikTok has emerged as a salient site for studying this
   turn: it has proven to be a highly successful tool in activist
   campaigns, strongly affords personalized communication, and supports a
   main user base of young people known for emphasizing self-expression in
   their online participation. Since remix is the core form of sharing on
   TikTok, users are encouraged to insert and articulate themselves not
   only in the process of content creation, but in the process of
   circulation as well. Here, we focus on the way remix is exploited as a
   mode of personalizing activist content on TikTok, particularly among
   young users. We do so by qualitatively coding and analyzing remixed
   content associated with the digital activist organization Gen-Z for
   Change. We find that, despite expectations based on prior research and
   the observed behavior of older users, young users tended to resist
   personalization in their remix strategies. Yet, they simultaneously
   managed to assert their presence in ways that are meaningful on the app.
   Our results elaborate on digital activist strategies and the role of
   platform affordances therein, and add important nuance to common
   conceptions of youth political participation styles.},

   undocumented immigrants},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {Stricter immigration attitudes are associated with rurality. I argue
   that rural consciousness can help explain this tendency; those Americans
   higher in rural consciousness should theoretically see undocumented
   immigrants as a lower-status out-group unduly favored by
   decision-makers. Using ANES data, I find that colder feelings toward
   undocumented/illegal immigrants and harsher immigration policy attitudes
   significantly and positively associate with rural consciousness for
   rural/small-town residents. This is not moderated by partisanship or
   racial resentment, though the effect is stronger for non-whites.
   Further, exposure to an experimental treatment article sympathizing with
   rural way of life being disrespected - i.e., highlighting rural people
   being disrespected, which is an element of rural consciousness- results
   in significantly warmer feelings toward undocumented immigrants for
   rural/small-town respondents compared to those in the control condition.
   Conversely, exposure to an article about racial demographic changes in
   rural areas, or to a lagging rural economic recovery article, did not
   consistently or significantly affect the outcome variable. This study
   both confirms links between rural resentment or consciousness in similar
   contexts, while providing evidence that such a relationship is driven by
   feelings of ingroup disrespect over economic or racial/ethnic threat.},

Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {This paper explores feelings in diplomatic intimacies in the United
   Nations in New York. Drawing upon arguments in philosophy on emotional
   experience and supported by oral testimonies of diplomats, it
   supplements and complements the rich body of work on practices in
   diplomacy by exploring how feelings can reach out and be directed
   towards things in the world beyond the bounds of the body and this is
   part of the phenomenology of everyday diplomatic lives. I set out three
   key interconnected goals in order to personify state diplomacy: First, I
   show how feelings are bound up with cognition and perception and are not
   the mere effects of these. Secondly, I link feelings with the affective
   context of the United Nations Security Council in order to expose
   everyday existential experiences of individual diplomats. Thirdly, I
   reveal the perceived importance of eliciting events in this geopolitical
   setting, and the personal meaning of these to diplomats as expressed
   through their own feelings as state representatives. This is a unique
   approach to understanding diplomacy in political geography, and also the
   first of its kind in the study of the intimate geopolitics of the UN.},

Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 7},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic can be considered a `period of emergency critical
   juncture' that affected social movements and collective action. Based on
   this premise, this article analyses its impact on youth activisms in
   Spain, investigating its structural or circumstantial nature. The
   research used in-depth interviews and focused on three types of youth
   activisms - feminisms, environmentalisms, and socio-community - chosen
   for either their mobilising force prior to the pandemic or their
   relevance during it. In order to assess the temporary or permanent
   effects of the pandemic on these activisms, three dimensions were
   studied: organisational forms, mobilisation issues and repertoires of
   action. The results allow us to identify short-term impacts, such as the
   interruption of the rhythm of activism, the prominence of the virtual
   world, and the creation of pragmatic alliances of local collective
   action, while at the same time allowing us to glimpse those that may
   have a more structural character such as the inclusion of mental health
   as an issue and the normalisation of repression and criminalisation of
   activism in securitarian contexts.},

Title = {The false promise of individual digital sovereignty in Europe: Comparing
   artificial intelligence and data regulations in China and the European
   Union},

Abstract = {In the digital sovereignty debate, countries and blocks seek to build
   technological and regulatory capacity to ascertain technological
   autonomy-definitions notwithstanding. Meanwhile, these actors seek to
   position themselves discursively, differentiating their own
   understanding of digital sovereignty from that of competing powers. In
   this context, the European Union (EU) elaborated the concept of digital
   sovereignty as something obtainable on an individual level, where
   regulations are put in place for users to be able to choose what
   personal data (not) to share. Meanwhile in China the government launched
   a number of artificial intelligence (AI) and data protection regulations
   along with an antitrust crackdown on numerous platform companies. This
   aimed at bringing technological giants (namely platforms), capable of
   handling massive amounts of data and influencing people's everyday
   lives, under stricter government rule. While the Chinese government has
   only partially framed these actions within frameworks akin to `digital
   sovereignty', the purported aim was accruing individual autonomy
   vis-a-vis big techs, arguably falling close to the EU's `digital

Title = {Inner Mongolian poetry and song as a form of resistance},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {115},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Against the backdrop of cultural assimilation policies taking place in
   Inner Mongolia and associated with a political regime geared to economic
   expansion, this article seeks to explore in which ways Mongolian poetry
   and song are being mobilized as a tacit and non-violent mode of
   resistance. Resistance in this paper does not only refer to challenging
   an immediate power structure with the objective of changing the status
   quo. Defined through a wider epistemological lens, it represents actions
   that continually empower the individual and the group to have autonomy
   over their history and future. We argue that by providing a means to
   contest, or reject the sanitized, stripped, and depoliticized Mongolian
   identity pushed by the Chinese state, poetry and songs serve as acts and
   spaces of resistance and emancipation, upheld by the continuous
   co-creation, and defense of collective memories.},

Title = {Environmental statecraft and changing spatial politics: Erhai Lake
   protection in China},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {115},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Studies on environmental governance have mainly focused on the
   relationship between local state, market, and community. However, how an
   environmental agenda is achieved by multi-scalar state actors and how
   these multi-scalar interventions reshape urban spatial politics have
   been understudied. This research investigates the protection of Erhai
   Lake in Dali, a third-tier city in Western China. Erhai Lake protection
   is a high-profile initiative proposed by the top leader. However, it is
   not only conducted through a top-down target-setting authoritarian
   system but has also invoked market and state interventions from various
   scales. Based on this case, we first reflect on statecraft in governing
   environmental sustainability in China, which manifested in mobilizing
   hybrid instruments to achieve the environmental goal. Second,
   environmental practices at the local scale do not municipalize
   environmental resources. Instead, the provincial-level state stands out
   in influencing local regulations and deploying state-owned enterprises
   to achieve environmental and economic ends. These actions peripheralize
   local city authorities in economic development, social management, and
   environmental assets management, undermining the entrepreneurial stance
   of the city government. This research contributes to understanding the
   co-evolution of urban spatial politics and environmental practices.},

   education quality and social mobility in Switzerland},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {84},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Over the past 20 years, per-student spending on compulsory education in
   Switzerland has risen by 52 percent in real terms. However, per-pupil
   expenditures vary significantly across cantons. The question quickly
   arises whether ``more is always better{''}. Switzerland lends itself to
   this analysis because spending authority lies with the cantons and thus
   provides a good setting for a withincountry analysis. We use a new
   comprehensive dataset to measure educational quality and mobility at the
   individual level. Our analysis shows that higher cantonal spending does
   not increase educational quality or mobility. The allocation of
   education spending seems to be more important than its mere amount. For
   example, our study suggests a better linguistic integration of
   foreign-speaking students.},

Journal = {TERRITORY POLITICS GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 3},
Abstract = {The analytical emphasis on migration control and external borders has
   overlooked the mechanisms of state regulation of internal mobility in
   the peripheral territories of the countries of the European Union. Based
   on an analysis focused on the Spanish case, and more specifically on the
   enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla and the Canary Islands, this article
   introduces the concept of transferability to show the logics and
   dynamics of intraterritorial migrant (im)mobility between the peripheral
   enclaves and mainland Spain. The analysis shows the construction - and
   evolution - of (in)transferable migrant subjects and the complex and
   changing puzzle of (im)mobility at these peripheral geographies.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS},

Abstract = {Democratic societies inherently depend on an informed citizenry. By
   shaping citizens' voting behavior, fostering political cynicism, and
   reducing trust in institutions, misinformation can pose significant
   challenges to individuals and societies. Against this backdrop,
   fact-checking initiatives aimed at verifying the accuracy of publicly
   disseminated (mis)information have flourished worldwide. However,
   existing research is disproportionately oriented toward the Global
   North, with a focus on the United States and the most influential
   organizations. Equally scarce are comparative studies. To address these
   shortcomings, this study introduces a context-sensitive framework for
   analyzing fact-checking cultures and illustrates its application in a
   cross-national comparative design by contrasting two countries from the
   Global South and North: Brazil and Germany. Using a mixed-methods
   design, we integrate computational, qualitative, and quantitative
   content analysis of 11 fact-checking organizations and 13,498
   fact-checking articles over 11 years (2013-2023), alongside qualitative
   semistructured interviews with fact-checkers (N = 10). Our findings
   reveal several areas of divergence and convergence, suggesting that
   fact-checking cultures transcend organizational and national boundaries.},

Title = {Trust in a national anti-corruption agency: A survey experiment among

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {85},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Are anti-corruption agencies able to secure public trust, promote public
   integrity and fight political corruption in the eyes of the general
   public? The paper investigates this question by focusing on France,
   which became a leader in the fight against corruption after the launch
   in 2013 of the High Authority for the Transparency in Public Life
   (HATVP). We run a survey experiment among 3000 citizens and 33 experts
   to collect their prior beliefs about political corruption, and then
   evaluate the impact of granting information about the track record of
   the national agency on citizens' perceptions of its effectiveness and
   legitimacy. The paper provides four main results. First, as expected,
   information provision has meaningful and positive impacts on citizens'
   perceptions of the HATVP, political transparency, and representative
   democracy. Second, while most beneficial impacts are broad-based,
   treatment effects are as large or even larger among the most poorly
   informed and distrustful citizens. Third, the experiment points toward
   the existence of a modest ``integrity paradox{''}, i.e., an increase in
   the salience or perceived severity of corruption when citizens are
   better informed about the anti-corruption agency. Fourth, information
   provision reduces the divergence of opinions between the average citizen
   and experts about the effectiveness of the HATVP and the dynamics of
   political integrity.},

Abstract = {This article explores the lived experiences of Ukrainian soldiers in a
   romantic relationship with another soldier in the same unit in the
   Russo-Ukrainian War. Contributing to scholarship on military couples,
   embodied experiences of war, human dimensions of warfare, and soldierly
   love, the study aims to understand how these soldiers are affected
   emotionally and as soldiers by having a relationship on the frontline.
   Drawing upon the Grounded Theory method, based on eight semi-structured
   interviews with soldiers from four couples, the findings visualize these
   experiences through four theoretical constructs. Having a relationship
   while serving on the frontline endowed these soldiers in Ukraine with an
   existential purpose that was protective and motivating, making them
   cautious and feel less dehumanized but also stressed from fear of loss.
   The findings have implications for how armed forces understand soldiers'
   emotional needs and relations at war.},

Abstract = {Our study investigates the performance of vote centers in two counties
   that adopted them in 2020. Vote centers allow voters to cast their
   ballots at any polling location. These cases offer two different
   contexts in terms of state legal requirements and oversight. Fresno
   County adopted vote centers in compliance with the California Voter's
   Choice Act, while St. Louis County implemented vote centers without any
   state guidelines beyond those for traditional in-person voting. In this
   study, we focus on voter and poll worker awareness and evaluation of
   vote centers and voter perceptions of the electoral environment and
   their experience under the vote center model. We find largely positive
   evaluations and strong preferences for vote centers in both counties.
   Nevertheless, we observe some key differences in voting experiences
   reflecting the different local circumstances and legal environments in
   the two jurisdictions, including differences in wait times and
   difficulty finding voting locations. While many jurisdictions may wait
   until state law allows vote centers, this study shows that local
   election officials can adapt the system to local conditions and
   implement it successfully without state guidance. These are important
   considerations given the increasing number of jurisdictions considering
   vote centers.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces the Judges and Agrarian Reform ( jAR ) dataset, a
   municipality-year panel that records the allocation of 11 761 public
   land lots -up to approximately 260 000 hectares- to private actors
   through a judicial mechanism distinct from the way estab- lished by the
   land reform, to wit, adverse possession. Our statistical and GIs
   analysis suggests that the judicial allocation of public land has had
   two opposing effects: Land accumulation and access to land for landless
   peasants. We focus on the former effect through the case studies of C \&
   oacute;rdoba and Casanare. The jAR database provides novel nationwide
   data to explain the determinants and effects of the role of the
   judiciary in land reform implementation in Colombia.},

Abstract = {The article pretends to stably lay down guidelines so that the justice
   operators of land can resolve the ambiguities of interpretation to
   determine the legal nature of the property. From logical, historical and
   teleological criteria, interpretative parameters are stablished for the
   application of the 48(th) article of the 160 law of 1994 relating to the
   formula of accreditation of private property, sustaining a transactional
   vision that allows us to unify criteria in the procedures and avoid that
   the qualification of the legal nature of property becomes a byzantine
   activity of paleography that would imply that we have to wait another
   200 years so we can have a complete inventory of property in Colombia
   and thus effectively undertake the reforms that our society requires.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveScholars have struggled to understand Donald Trump's surprising
   levels of Latino support in two consecutive presidential elections. We
   test three hypotheses to better understand the strength and weakness of
   Trump, Biden, and both political parties.MethodsWe conduct bivariate and
   multivariate analyses of pre- and post-election surveys to identify
   sources of support (beyond national origin differences) that explain how
   Trump improved his level of support among Latino voters to reach the
   low- to mid- 30 percent range.ResultsIntra-Latino differences in
   ideology, identity (gender and religion), and immigration attitudes help
   explain Trump's relatively strong showing among Latinos in
   2020.ConclusionWhile the nation's electorate is becoming more
   demographically diverse, many predictions associated with the notion of
   ``demography as destiny{''} should be tempered given the political
   heterogeneity among Latino voters.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe literature on celebrity politics often asserts that
   celebrity politicians are good at fundraising. They are wealthy people
   in wealthy social networks, and this should give them a fundraising
   advantage compared to their noncelebrity opponents. Yet, this hypothesis
   has never been tested.MethodFundraising data from 1964 to 2022 was
   collected from multiple sources.ResultsThis study finds that celebrity
   candidates are typically not able to out-fundraise their opponents. Yet
   they perform remarkably well despite this
   disadvantage.ConclusionsCelebrities tend to win elections when they
   raise more money than their opponents, run in open-seat contests or
   local elections. They tend to lose elections when they lose the
   fundraising battle, challenge incumbents, or seek federal offices.},

Title = {Which one is your team? Supraordinate identity around the classic match},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {105},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1253-1265},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objective: The article analyzes up to what extent the supraordinate
   identity made up by the classic match, influences fans' consumption
   intention of media and official merchandise, through a justifiability
   mediation, while assessing a moderation effect that an identity threat
   has on the proposed model. Method: The phenomenon was tested through
   structural equation modeling on a 439 fanbase sample. Participants are
   fans from both of the clubs who play the Classic match of their league
   and were randomly allocated into a threat circumstance or a control
   situation in order to test the identity threat moderation effect.
   Results: Findings suggest that this supraordinate identity has a
   positive impact on media and merchandise consumption intentions, while
   legitimacy and permeability forecast its existence. These results argue
   that fans from both teams experience an identity threat either when
   their club is under menace and when their rival is. Conclusion: This is
   the first article examining a supraordinate identity fabricated by
   salient rivalries, which is counterintuitive, and how these individuals
   experience an identity threat when their rival is at risk. The Classic
   denotes an important marketing instrument, where leagues and clubs can
   develop stories and rivalries to attract broader audiences.},

Abstract = {The issue of sexual violence that this article was tasked to deal with
   is neither new nor devoid of a regulating legislative framework.
   Moreover, a number of scientists from diff erent countries and
   institutions of the world have devoted their works to the topic under
   discussion, which has repeatedly been subjected to discussions in the
   European Court of Human Rights, International Criminal Court, and ad hoc
   tribunals.However, this article aspires to analyze the normative
   framework for the regulation of sexual violence in line with Article 36
   of the Istanbul Convention in Germany and Georgia after the ratifi
   cation of the Convention in the last decade. The main focus of the study
   is the contentious interpretation of consent in sexual off ences. Due to
   the inevitable legislation reforms concerning sexual violence, this
   academic work examines new trends on regulating this issue in Western
   countries, especially in Germany, considering the historical ties of
   Georgian Criminal Code to German law. The article discusses sexual
   violence in general, providing a brief review of sexual violence
   legislation, where it is mainly presented by considering the
   international legal framework. Sexual violence and other sexual off
   ences according to Georgian and German criminal codes are presented in
   general terms and in a comparative manner. The article also explains
   rape in the light of its re-conceptualization, encompassing an analysis
   on sexual violence, including rape, especially in relation to consent.
   This, in turn, can prompt amendments to Georgian Criminal Code on the
   related issue, which currently does not comply with the standards on
   interpreting sexual violence, established by the Istanbul Convention and
   other important related international acts.},

Abstract = {Do investment incentives influence private firms' location decisions?
   Whereas prior research emphasizes tax incentives, we focus on incentives
   that require real-time government spending including job training and
   infrastructure. Real incentives influence where firms invest by
   resolving costly information asymmetries, and are subject to budget
   constraints that give rise to political targeting. This paper evaluates
   how real incentives shape the location decisions of foreign firms,
   investors who suffer from acute information asymmetries. We leverage
   features of the Great Recession and the 2009 American Recovery and
   Reinvestment Act stimulus, which temporarily increased states' fiscal
   capacity to fund real incentives. During the narrow stimulus spending
   window, states that received more federal Medicaid stimulus-instrumented
   with the exogenous component of the Act's funding formula-attracted more
   foreign direct investment (FDI) and increased state spending on real
   incentives. The stimulus window approximately coincides with FDI's
   temporary geographic expansion into US counties that lacked a history of
   these investments. On average, these counties had narrow vote margins in
   the prior gubernatorial election and garnered more state real incentive
   spending. These correlates are pronounced in counties with idle
   industrial capacity and in states whose governors sought re-election.
   Tax incentives had no effect on FDI. These findings have important
   implications for the efficacy of investment incentives and the political
   economy of industrial policy.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the question of trust in communication, or mediated
   trust, with regard to the historical evolution of the Internet and, more
   recently, debates around the impacts of artificial intelligence (AI). At
   a conceptual level, it proposes a `Three I's' framework of ideas,
   interests, and institutions as a way of understanding how and why
   current proposals for greater regulation of digital platforms
   counterpose questions around credibility and social licence for digital
   tech giants against a dominant set of ideas around the Internet as a
   privileged domain of free speech. By contrast, the rise of AI comes at a
   time when data-driven business models associated with dominant platform
   businesses are in the ascendancy, so institutional arrangements need to
   be considered as a form of countervailing power to the capacity of tech
   giants to use AI to further consolidate forms of economic, political and
   communications power.},

Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {This paper brings the narratives of the environmental activist groups
   Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil and Fridays for Future into
   conversation with Critical Anthropocene Theory and Indigenous
   environmentalism to interrogate pathways for and limits of environmental
   political action under planetary conditions marked by nonhuman shaping
   power. Critical Anthropocene Theory, the paper argues, can problematise
   the simplistic positivism and managerialism of the new `extinction
   activism'. However, the conversation with Indigenous environmental
   practices, which flexibly manage tensions within human-nonhuman
   relations and centre radical social impact, reveals the political
   limitations of both extinction activism and critical Anthropocene
   thinking. The paper distinguishes the logic of fast change within
   existing socio-political parameters, which drives extinction activism,
   from Critical Anthropocene Theory's focus on ontological change as a
   precondition for a non- exploitative environmental politics, which
   deprioritises activist practice. Different from both, the paper argues
   that Indigenous environmental activism is marked by a yet different
   pragmatic approach, where both modern and non-modern political means are
   mobilised towards radical change. Indigenous environmentalism is marked
   by the dynamic co-evolution of cosmology and politics and moves flexibly
   between modern/nonmodern boundaries, highlighting new pathways for
   political action in the relational Anthropocene.},

Title = {Ignorance As Political Instrument? Integration Discourses on Migrant
   Welfare Recipients in Switzerland},

Pages = {1150-1172},

Abstract = {Agnotology, the study of doubt and ignorance in areas where knowledge
   can be possessed, altered, hidden, and reclaimed, offers multiple
   insights into the working of states. This article explores the role of
   `ignoring' as an active strategy of ignorance; a practice used by local
   governments to disregard certain knowledge and the production of
   alternative framings. Studying the intersection of welfare and migration
   policy based on an example of policy making and implementation in
   Switzerland, this work shows how resistance can be built by not paying
   attention, thus ignoring certain rules and policies, while actively
   shaping alternative frameworks to increase migrants' rights. The cases
   build on the newly introduced Federal Act on Foreign Nationals and
   Integration, in which integration requirements exclude social assistance
   reception for foreign nationals in case they intend to retain or
   stabilise their residence status. Any financial dependence will thus
   cause a potential loss of residence or settlement permit. Focusing on
   the deficit of migrants individually and as a collective, therefore
   allows governments to exclude them, making `knowledge production' and
   `ignoring' fruitful concepts to explore such bordering processes. Yet,
   two city initiatives contested these restrictions, developing
   alternative financial support for foreign nationals, even if one of them
   was ruled unlawful. The examples show how authorities create sanctuary
   policies and choose to circumvent laws through an active ignoring of
   national policy intentions, reframing them on the local level. Linking
   ignorance to such local scales and their sanctuary support provides an
   asset in understanding local and practical endeavours of municipalities
   to secure political autonomy and increase resistance strategies. Hence,
   a restrictive understanding of integration at the national level
   foregrounds a one-sided view of non-citizens as costly and potential
   abusers of allegedly generous welfare support. Migration and social
   policy laws support such a one-sided perspective by allowing assessments
   to consider mainly economic integration, thereby excluding those who are
   not active in the labour market. However, local responses can challenge
   this one-sidedness by choosing to ignore an overly restrictive framework
   and try out potentials to resist.},

Title = {Volumising territorial sovereignty: Atmospheric sciences, climate, and
   the vertical dimension in 20th century China},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {111},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Works in Political Geography have focused on the exercise of territorial
   sovereignty beyond land, emphasising the voluminousness and dynamism of
   material forces that condition how territory is governed. In comparison,
   works on modern territorial statehood in IR have generally overlooked
   the question of materiality. By combining the attentiveness to
   more-than-human materiality in Political Geography with IR's focus on
   the role of epistemic transformations in the history of the modern
   international system, this article proposes a more comprehensive
   understanding of territorial sovereignty and modern statehood as
   constituted by the technoscientific management of the territory's
   materiality. Using the development of atmospheric sciences in the 19th
   century as an example of science -state entanglement in the emergence of
   the modern international system, this article shows that the integration
   of atmospheric knowledge production with state and international
   governance produced the vertical dimension as a realm of governmental
   concern. Through a detailed case study of the development of atmospheric
   sciences in early 20th-century China and scientific ideas about China's
   climate, this article demonstrates how the scientific discovery of the
   vertical dimension reconfigures territorial sovereignty as sovereignty
   over volume.},

Abstract = {The expanding political role of Big Tech(nology) corporations has
   triggered concerns about the role of the media in holding corporate
   power to account. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of
   role dynamics between journalists and lobbyists toward the agenda for
   Big Tech's responsibilities. Based on semi-structured interviews with
   European journalists (n = 15) and lobbyists representing large
   technology corporations (n = 15), we use professional role perceptions
   as a heuristic for examining the relationship of both actor groups in
   tandem. Journalists, who report an overlap of audience-focused with
   passive watchdog role ideals geared toward legislative accountability,
   interact with lobbyists, who assert a more concrete and active role
   perception. Journalists cautiously appropriate their normative watchdog
   role in accordance with the ideals of detachment and balance to maintain
   their own media legitimacy and access to an oligopolistic information
   environment. Remaining strategically sovereign over information,
   lobbyists perceive a strong mandate to establish Big Tech as a relevant
   stakeholder in the agenda on their regulatory accountability, but in mid
   of a perceived techlash, the majority of corporations avoid public
   attention. Both actor groups' limited and off-the-record interaction
   reflects a defensive corporate stance, keeping their negotiation of Big
   Tech's accountability off-stage. The technological and regulatory
   complexity of the information environment might render these
   corporations unfit for soft regulation by news media. We discuss
   implications for their co-dependence in the context of fast
   technological advancement and disruption of (corporate) mediatization
   processes.},

Abstract = {PurposeAt the beginning of the 21st century, a new class of information
   workers, the ``information have-less{''} has risen. This class of
   workers alleviates the influence of information and communication
   technologies (ICTs) revolution on poverty and unemployment. The purpose
   of this study is to investigate the presence of this class of workers in
   Egypt and assess the size and potential growth of this category of
   workers.Design/methodology/approachThe study clarifies the conceptual
   framework of the new division of labor, in the information age. The
   Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics, American Chamber
   of Commerce in Egypt, Ministry of Communications and Information
   Technology and Information and Decision Support Center websites provided
   secondary data for this study. These data are used to assess the size of
   ``the information have less{''} in Egypt.FindingsThe division of work
   and class, in the 21st century, depends on the level of skills possessed
   to work with ICTs. So, class and labor nowadays could be divided into
   self-programmable labor (Innovators). Information have-less labor class,
   adding value to the economy by learning skills and presenting repetitive
   work. Generic labor class, who cannot work with ICTs, and work in jobs,
   that do not need computers or other ICTs. The study has shown that the
   ``information have-less{''} labor class is present in Egypt since the
   beginning of the 21st century, in all its categories; entrepreneurism,
   the service sector and the manufacturing sector. There are approximately
   50\% of this labor class in the service sector and only 13\% of the
   information have-less works in manufacturing sector despite the great
   opportunities that Egypt has to expand manufacturing to absorb more
   employment. The inclusion of information technology (IT), in all
   domains, has not decreased employment in Western countries but has
   reallocated information have-less employment toward the service sector,
   and there would probably be the same effect in Egypt.Practical
   implicationsThe study highlights the need for Egyptian policymakers to
   encourage the manufacturing and service sectors to provide huge working
   opportunities. The Egyptian government has to change the educational
   policies, at all stages, to include digital learning skills so IT can be
   incorporated in a wide range of economic activities. Further research
   includes: conducting a survey to measure the contribution of the
   entrepreneurial part of the information have-less employment in Egypt.
   In addition, a model may be developed, by the researcher to examine the
   reallocation of employees in Egypt.Originality/valueStudying employment,
   in Egypt, using the conceptual framework of the information age is
   rarely being done.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis article examines the relationship between environmental
   health threats, personal experiences with climate change, and their
   association with attitudes toward global warming and willingness to pay
   for clean energy.MethodsUsing a nationally representative survey of
   Latino adults (n = 1200), we use categorical regressions to examine the
   relationship between environmental health threats and policy
   preferences.ResultsLatinos who have personally experienced climate
   change and who view air pollution as a threat, are more likely to be
   concerned with climate change and believe that passing stricter
   environmental laws will improve the economy as opposed to reduce
   econonic growth. Latinos who have experienced climate change and worry
   about the impact of climate change in their homeland are also more
   willing to pay \$5 or \$10 for clean energy.ConclusionThis study has
   implications for our collective knowledge of Latinos' connections to the
   environment and policy outcomes and contributes to the growing area of
   environmental public opinion among ethno-racial groups.},

Abstract = {De facto states seek international recognition. But do patron states
   that extend such recognition to their de-facto state clients treat them
   differently than they would have done otherwise? Will patrons, having
   extended official recognition, be more inclined to treat their clients
   as `regular' states? Or does recognition only make the client more
   beholden to the patron? To investigate this, we explore whether granting
   recognition affects the degree of patron-state penetration of two
   sectors critical to the de facto state for retaining (internal)
   sovereignty and agency: the executive branch, and the military.},

Abstract = {This research examines the effectiveness of ballot access reforms which
   may increase voter turnout. While many reforms are designed to reduce
   individual costs of voting-to register, obtain, and cast a ballot-their
   impacts should be observable in the aggregate. U.S. states determine and
   administer rules concerning the conduct of elections, so the success of
   those rules should be measured for statewide elections. Existing
   research focuses on presidential elections. Yet if reforms influence
   levels of voter participation, stronger evidence of attracting
   peripheral voters should be found in midterm elections. This research
   examines state variation in electoral law on registration and voting in
   statewide, general elections from 2000 to 2018. Voting reforms evaluated
   include same-day registration, no-excuses absentee voting, early voting,
   and all-mail voting. Simple and multivariate analysis, including
   state-level demographic controls, suggest only limited effects of
   electoral innovations on voting-eligible turnout, in both midterm and
   presidential elections. Reforms designed to increase turnout produce at
   best modest positive effects.},

Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {This article examines Moldova's prospective membership in the European
   Union (EU) in the wake of the EU's renewed enlargement drive which was
   prompted by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. It explores the dynamics
   shaping Moldova's accession path, spotlighting obstacles to integration
   that official reports appear to overlook or under-- play. The article
   compares EU and Moldovan documents, civil society reports, and in--
   sights from interviews with Moldovan officials and civil society
   representatives to gain a nuanced picture of the evolving situation.
   Attention is also given to the distinct characteristics of the currently
   unfolding enlargement process, including its sense of urgency and
   geopolitical significance which have led to calls for an expedited or
   `fast- track' accession. Findings note that despite Moldova's impressive
   progress in aligning with EU standards in many areas, substantial
   hurdles in justice reform, combating corruption and de-oligarchisation
   persist. Incomplete public administration reforms, uneven civil society
   involvement in decision-making, and issues associated with the
   Transnistria conflict also have consequences for Moldova's EU prospects,
   especially if an expedited version of enlargement occurs.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the first seven years of the National Land Agency's
   management of the demarcation implementation-the agrarian procedure that
   seeks to delimit lands owned by the nation, such as floodplains and
   floodplain lakes. After reviewing its scarce implementation in the south
   of Bolivar, this paper argues that, by 2022, the reforms introduced by
   the last peace agreement negotiated between the Colombian State and the
   FARc guerrillas did not dynamize delimitations. On the contrary, the
   review of communications, minutes, and official records shows that
   agrarian authority endemic problems continue, such as the lack of
   institutional capacity and poor interinstitutional coordination.},

   Limitation of Economics},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 20},
Abstract = {We assess the potential of economics to contribute to the understanding
   of terrorism. We argue that the economic approach portraying terrorists
   and law enforcement agents as rational actors yoked to other disciplines
   is a source of precise falsifiable causal hypotheses. Theoretical
   economics rooted in rational choice provides precisely falsifiable
   hypotheses. This falsifiability makes it easier to focus on identifying
   causal relationships, which is essential for sound policy advice.
   Economists have developed a multitude of rigorous tools for causal
   inference ranging from instrumental variables to machine learning, which
   are essential in typical situations of terrorism that are beset by
   endogeneity problems. However, neighboring disciplines are needed to
   provide a rich contextual analysis that allows the assessment of the
   external validity of the results rigorously derived by economic
   analyses. Ultimately, rigorous mathematical analysis is valid only if it
   can capture reality wholly and simply.},

Title = {Policy evolution through coherence, consistency and alignment: the
   Shenzhen low carbon policy case},
Journal = {GLOBAL PUBLIC POLICY AND GOVERNANCE},

Abstract = {Ideally policies are characterised by alignment between goals and
   instruments, coherence of the former and consistency of the latter.
   However, in practice policy mixes are merely patched up to solve
   problems, influencing how policy evolves over time, typically generating
   increased policy complexity. It remains unclear how policy goal
   coherence, instrumental consistency, and goal-instrument alignment
   influence the long-term evolution of low-carbon policies. To address
   this, this study analyzes the characteristics of low-carbon policy
   evolution in Shenzhen City (1994-2022) and employ a quantitative
   longitudinal research design to examine these influences. Overall,
   policy evolution was characterized by gradual increase in policies with
   peaks in 2012 and 2021, leading to policy accumulation with increasing
   policy subdomains. This was in part due to Shenzhen City serving as a
   national low carbon pilot zone and local government responding to
   national government programs. Policy evolution entailed a large variety
   of policy goals and instruments, with policy goals evolving rather
   flexibly with new goals replacing old ones, while policy instruments
   developed more incrementally leading to replacement, conversion but also
   to cases of policy layering. We identified the key factors driving
   evolution of low-carbon policies, including the city's strategic
   positioning, the focus of (local) leadership, and the city's response to
   national policies. Moreover, a fairly balanced distribution in policy
   dynamics was observed; this concerned a good fit (replacement) and a
   poor fit (conversion and layering) between new policies and existing
   policy mixes. Additionally, policy dynamics varied across and within
   subdomains.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 17},
Abstract = {Research on perceptions of deservingness has so far mainly focused on
   cash benefits. We correct this imbalance by studying public attitudes
   towards access to social investment services, specifically, subsidised
   childcare. Based on the well-established corpus of deservingness
   research and recent work on varieties of social investment, we expect
   the traditional deservingness criteria to matter and for results to vary
   across countries. To test our argument, we rely on an original survey
   experiment conducted in 2021 in six Western countries (Denmark, Sweden,
   Germany, Switzerland, the UK and the USA). We find that cross-national
   patterns of responses broadly reflect the categorisation of three types
   of social investments, that is, inclusive, stratified and targeted
   social investment. Further, we find that some of the well-known
   determinants of deservingness perceptions play an important role in the
   attribution of priorities of parents who need childcare: most clearly
   need and identity (operationalised with the parents' nationality and
   their length of residency). This is true in all six countries covered.
   We conclude that patterns of deservingness perceptions to subsidised
   childcare services are determined by a mix of institutional factors
   (that differ across welfare regimes) and more fundamental attitudes
   towards helping those in need.},

Abstract = {Policy process literature offers several frameworks and theories to
   understand the adoption or modification of policies across different
   jurisdictions. Extant studies focus on the emergence of coalitions,
   actors, strategies, etc. as they relate to individual policies. Policy
   actions, however, are typically deployed as packages-combinations of
   different instruments or measures. Policy mixes-also used
   interchangeably with terms such as policy packaging, policy bundling,
   etc.-are an important aspect of policy design. However, the role and
   emergence of policy mixes in the context of the policy process have not
   been studied in great depth. This study examines the role of different
   policy pathways that yield desired policy outcomes in the electric
   vehicle (EV) policy subsystem. We use the case of sub-national EV
   policies across the US to analyze how different combinations of policy
   actions operate in combination and/or competition with each other to
   achieve the desired policy objectives. The study contributes to the
   policy design scholarship in two ways. First, by analyzing the emergence
   of policy mixes as policy outputs during the policy design process using
   a theoretical lens applying the multiple streams framework. Second, by
   deploying fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis as a methodological
   tool to uncover causal pathways to desired policy outcomes.

   La literatura sobre procesos de pol \& iacute;ticas ofrece varios marcos
   y teor \& iacute;as para comprender la adopci \& oacute;n o modificaci
   \& oacute;n de pol \& iacute;ticas en diferentes jurisdicciones. Los
   estudios existentes se centran en el surgimiento de coaliciones,
   actores, estrategias, etc. en relaci \& oacute;n con pol \& iacute;ticas
   individuales. Sin embargo, las acciones pol \& iacute;ticas suelen
   implementarse como paquetes: combinaciones de diferentes instrumentos o
   medidas. Las combinaciones de pol \& iacute;ticas, tambi \& eacute;n
   utilizadas indistintamente con t \& eacute;rminos como paquetes de pol
   \& iacute;ticas, agrupaci \& oacute;n de pol \& iacute;ticas, etc., son
   un aspecto importante del dise \& ntilde;o de pol \& iacute;ticas. Sin
   embargo, el papel y el surgimiento de las combinaciones de pol \&
   iacute;ticas en el contexto del proceso de pol \& iacute;ticas no se han
   estudiado en gran profundidad. Este estudio examina el papel de
   diferentes v \& iacute;as de pol \& iacute;ticas que producen los
   resultados de pol \& iacute;ticas deseados en el subsistema de pol \&
   iacute;ticas de veh \& iacute;culos el \& eacute;ctricos. Utilizamos el
   caso de pol \& iacute;ticas de veh \& iacute;culos el \& eacute;ctricos
   subnacionales en los EE. UU. para analizar c \& oacute;mo diferentes
   combinaciones de acciones pol \& iacute;ticas operan en combinaci \&
   oacute;n y/o competencia entre s \& iacute; para lograr los objetivos de
   pol \& iacute;ticas deseados. El estudio contribuye a la investigaci \&
   oacute;n sobre dise \& ntilde;o de pol \& iacute;ticas de dos maneras.
   Primero, analizando el surgimiento de combinaciones de pol \&
   iacute;ticas como resultados de pol \& iacute;ticas durante el proceso
   de dise \& ntilde;o de pol \& iacute;ticas utilizando una lente te \&
   oacute;rica que aplica el marco de m \& uacute;ltiples corrientes. En
   segundo lugar, mediante la aplicaci \& oacute;n del an \& aacute;lisis
   comparativo cualitativo de conjuntos difusos como herramienta metodol \&
   oacute;gica para descubrir v \& iacute;as causales que conduzcan a los
   resultados de pol \& iacute;ticas deseados.},

Title = {Autonomies and the Construction of Communal Economies in Zapotec
   Villages in Oaxaca, Mexico},
Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {51},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {81-100},

Abstract = {San Jos \& eacute;, a Zapotec community in the Sierra Sur of Oaxaca,
   Mexico, has built certain autonomies over time while challenging the
   territorial policies designed by the Mexican state. This article goes
   beyond the focus on autonomies as jurisdictional rights recognized by
   the state and analyzes the de facto instances elaborated by communities
   to build economies as a support for self-determination. By strengthening
   its community organization, San Jos \& eacute; created a scheme of
   territorial possession to produce economies that enabled it to survive
   and challenge the Mexican state. It refused the government's titling of
   its lands given this would subordinate the community's interests to the
   territorial policies of the federal government. Instead, San Jos \&
   eacute; reconstructed colonial policies and institutions to appropriate
   its own territory and develop its own communal autonomy without relying
   on legal documentation from the Mexican state to endorse its rights to
   communal lands. The community created its own concepts of communal
   cultures by reconstructing mayordom \& iacute;as (civil-religious
   hierarchies), cofrad \& iacute;as (religious brotherhoods), rancho
   culture, a municipal agency, ancestral memory, and the Zapotec language.
   On this basis they have built a communal autonomous model and maintain
   communal means of production such as labor and territory. San Jose's
   experiences provide epistemologies and practices of how Indigenous
   communities can reduce inequalities in the centralizing contexts of
   neoliberal states that seek to eradicate Indigenous autonomies.San Jos
   \& eacute;, una comunidad zapoteca en la Sierra Sur de Oaxaca, M \&
   eacute;xico, ha construido autonom \& iacute;as a trav \& eacute;s del
   tiempo mientras ha desafiado las pol \& iacute;ticas territoriales dise
   \& ntilde;adas por el Estado mexicano. Mas all \& aacute; de enfocar a
   las autonom \& iacute;as como derechos a una jurisdicci \& oacute;n
   reconocida por el Estado, este art \& iacute;culo analiza las autonom \&
   iacute;as de facto que las comunidades elaboran para construir econom \&
   iacute;as como sost \& eacute;n de la autodeterminaci \& oacute;n. A
   partir de fortalecer su organizaci \& oacute;n comunitaria, San Jos \&
   eacute; creo un esquema de posesi \& oacute;n territorial para producir
   econom \& iacute;as que le permitieron sobrevivir y desafiar al Estado
   Mexicano en t \& eacute;rminos de no aceptar la titulaci \& oacute;n de
   sus tierras porque subordinaba los intereses de San Jos \& eacute; a las
   pol \& iacute;ticas territoriales del gobierno federal. San Jos \&
   eacute; reconstruy \& oacute; las pol \& iacute;ticas e instituciones
   coloniales para apropiarse de su territorio y elaborar su propia autonom
   \& iacute;a comunitaria sin contar con documentaci \& oacute;n jur \&
   iacute;dica del Estado mexicano que avale sus tierras comunales. Creo
   sus propios conceptos de culturas comunales reconstruyendo las mayordom
   \& iacute;as, cofrad \& iacute;as, la cultura de ranchos, la agencia
   municipal, la memoria ancestral y la lengua zapoteca para crear un
   modelo auton \& oacute;mico comunal y mantuvo los medios de producci \&
   oacute;n comunales como el trabajo y el territorio. Las experiencias de
   San Jos \& eacute; aportan epistemolog \& iacute;as y pr \&
   aacute;cticas de c \& oacute;mo las comunidades ind \& iacute;genas
   pueden aminorar las desigualdades en contextos centralizadores de los
   Estados neoliberales que buscan erradicar las autonom \& iacute;as ind
   \& iacute;genas.},

Abstract = {How does the public form preferences on racialized policy issues that
   are both widely discussed and broadly misunderstood? This has been the
   question centering around the sudden attacks on academic terms like ``
   critical race theory{''} (CRT). I argue that the politicization of, and
   opinion polarization around, critical race theory is evidence of what I
   call policy branding, where political parties or organizations brand an
   arbitrary concept that has national salience into a policy issue. Using
   a series of original survey experiments, this study shows that one of
   the primary sources of opposition to critical race theory is the literal
   use of the term. I juxtapose this with evidence that the education
   policy issue at the core, antiracist teaching, maintained strong public,
   bipartisan support. This study has implications for the consequences of
   political elite capture of academic concepts and ideas.},

Abstract = {Moral foundations theory is one of the most popularised and tested
   lenses of recent years, with its ability to account for differences in
   political ideology. For the first time using a nationally representative
   random probability sample, we assess how the newly refined moral
   foundation questionnaire may explain differences in political ideology
   and views on political issues in the UK. We confirm a six-factor model
   with robust estimates for the moral intuitions of care, equality,
   proportionality, authority, loyalty, and purity. We then use moral
   intuitions to predict (a) economic left-right and socially
   liberal-conservative ideology and (b) the relationship between political
   ideology and views on salient political issues. We find moral intuitions
   mostly play a unifying role across a series of issues, with the
   exception of feelings toward patriotism and Brexit.},

Abstract = {In 1989, much of the Communist world disappeared. But in the People's
   Socialist Republic of Albania the Communist leadership hunkered down and
   insisted its path was uninterrupted by events in countries that had
   hardly been real socialist countries anyway. By then, Albania's
   long-time ruler Enver Hoxha had been dead for four years. Having
   survived regime changes that shook the Communist world, Hoxha was
   decidedly obsessed with the ensuring that his succession would ensure
   that Albanian Stalinism would survive. Starting in 1981, when Hoxha
   embarked on what would become his last really great purge, one can see
   signs of what lay ahead. These events shed light on what happened in
   Albania when Communism started to unravel in late 1990 and inaugurated
   what looks like a never-ending transition.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Human rights law has been dismissed as Eurocentric in situations where
   it has been invoked to justify neo-liberal power relations. Yet
   Eurocentrism also works in other ways. Human rights experts have adopted
   notions of ``hatred{''} patterned on Western-dominated histories, then
   have subsequently reproduced these notions in the form of identity-based
   categories such as race, religion, gender, or sexuality. However, these
   same experts have overlooked millions of victims of
   government-orchestrated, loyalty-based hostilities. Despite ongoing
   disagreements about whether or how to penalize individual citizens for
   extreme speech acts, human rights bodies should expand their conceptions
   of hatred to include abuses rooted in histories other than those modeled
   on Western violations.},

Abstract = {Gun violence against children in the United States (U.S.) is a public
   health crisis which violates the human rights of its victims, resulting
   in lasting morbidity and death. Firearm-related injury is the leading
   cause of death for children under eighteen years old in the U.S. We use
   the United Nations (UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UN
   Convention on the Rights of the Child, and UN Sustainable Development
   Goals to analyze gun violence against children in the U.S. from a human
   rights perspective. We recommend to 1) ratify the UN Convention on the
   Rights of the Child, establishing a framework for comprehensive gun law
   reform, 2) partner with the UN Special Representative for the
   Secretary-General on Violence Against Children to draft policy, 3)
   increase gun violence research funding, and 4) implement evidence-based
   community violence prevention programs.},

   reforms: Singular they as a de-gendering or multi-gendering strategy},

Abstract = {Gender is traditionally conceptualized as a binary construct, which is
   reflected in the use of binary-gendered third-person pronouns.
   Gender-inclusive pronouns such as singular they challenge this
   conceptualization, which can evoke resistance against their use.
   Singular they can be used generically when gender is unknown
   (de-gendering), or to specifically highlight an individual's non-binary
   gender identity (multi-gendering). The different uses of singular they
   can threaten different ideological convictions and impact the use and
   perception of the pronoun. Experiment 1 (N = 599) showed that in
   de-gendering contexts, participants preferred to use singular they but
   in multi-gendering contexts they preferred binary pronouns. Social
   identification with one's gender group, RWA and binary gender views
   predicted less use of singular they in both contexts. In Experiment 2 (N
   = 199), participants evaluated sentences with singular they in
   de-gendering and multi-gendering contexts. Overall, sentences with
   singular they in de-gendering contexts were more positively evaluated.
   SDO predicted less positive evaluations of they in de-gendering
   contexts, while RWA and binary gender views predicted less positive
   evaluations of they in multi-gendered contexts. The findings provide
   important knowledge in understanding ideological motivations for
   resistance against gender-inclusive language.},

Abstract = {Conflicts involving pastoralists have been on the rise in the past two
   decades in West, Central and East Africa. This article argues that land
   alienation is a major source of this type of violence. We employ a
   narrow identification strategy of relevant pastoral conflicts based on
   the Armed Conflict Location Event Dataset and create a unique indicator
   of land alienation comprised of three types of land use changes
   (conversion of land into conservation areas, crop farms, and industrial
   mining projects). Relying on a disaggregated quantitative comparative
   design of 50 km-by-50 km cells covering the Sahelian region from 2002 to
   2019, we find that land alienation is an underlying cause of pastoral
   conflicts. Moreover, we show that the impact of land alienation on
   pastoralist violence spreads over long distances and is influenced by
   state presence and climatic conditions. Our analysis further reveals an
   overlap between pastoralist violence and armed conflict. Bridging a gap
   between macro- and micro-level studies, we contribute to shed more light
   on the determinants of pastoral conflicts, a type of violence that has
   received scant attention in the geospatial quantitative literature.},

Abstract = {The recent growth of transnational municipal networks requires a better
   understanding of their evolution. For some actors, this growth has
   resulted in arbitrary or top-down decisions on network membership
   followed by low commitment and inefficient use of time and financial
   resources. By reinterpreting secondary data through an evolutionary
   approach, this paper argues that the overall systemic nature of the
   networks is shaped not only by their institutional settings and the
   composition of actors but also by a set of specific qualities
   (coherence, boundedness and unified function) that may change over time.
   Based on the network perspective and system approach, the paper advances
   our understanding of transnational knowledge networks and the maximising
   of their effectiveness. Using exemplars, it suggests a conceptual
   framework for the evolution of transnational municipal knowledge
   networks.},

Abstract = {The dynamics of Salafi activism in African settings have gained
   attention in recent years. In the light of the regional spread of
   jihadist militancy, Salafi-jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and
   al-Shabaab have made international headlines. At the same time, Salafi
   groups and activists across the region have not shied away from `playing
   politics' and engaging with secular elites and political parties. What
   explains this Salafi involvement in secular party politics? This article
   addresses this question based on a case study of the Ghanaian Anbariya
   movement, an influential Islamic group that was created by the eminent
   cleric Afa Ajura in Dagbon in the 1950s and gradually evolved into a
   major pillar of homegrown Ghanaian Salafism. Identifying the Anbariya as
   a reformist group in the sphere of political Salafism, we contend that
   the movement's sustained involvement in the political process has been
   inextricably linked with a protracted chieftaincy rivalry pitting
   against each other the Abudu and Andani royal gates of Dagbon. As we
   explore the Anbariya's involvement in this conflict and in Ghanaian
   party politics, we highlight the potential of communal cleavages for
   shaping the political preferences of religious actors.},

   participation in political violence and protests in selected Arab

Abstract = {It is often proposed that the young unemployed are more likely to engage
   in political violence, conflicts, and protests. One problem in studying
   the unemployed - especially in the Global South - are the blurred lines
   between the unemployed, the employed, and those working in the informal
   sector. Further, the employed are a heterogeneous group so employment
   quality might also play an important role. To tackle these issues, this
   study uses a new quantitative dataset, which covers youth in five Middle
   Eastern and North African countries: Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco,
   and Tunisia. These data provide considerably more fine-grained
   information about the employment situations of the respondents than the
   datasets previously used. The study investigates separately two forms of
   political participation: in political violence and in demonstrations.
   The regression analyses show that there is no clear difference between
   the young unemployed and the young employed in their likelihood to
   participate in the studied political activities. However, some features
   related to employment matter. Those whose employment status is ambiguous
   are substantially more likely to participate in demonstrations and
   political violence than the employed. Among those who work, those who
   are dissatisfied with their work and those who work fewer hours
   participate more often in these activities. Income on its own does not
   seem to have an effect; however, those who have more assets are more
   likely to participate, and compared to those who feel themselves middle
   income, those feeling rich or poor are more likely to engage in
   political violence and demonstrations. The results suggest that instead
   of thinking in terms of a dichotomy of the employed and unemployed, more
   emphasis should be placed on understanding the variety of employment
   situations and employment quality and their impact on political
   instability.},

Abstract = {The tendency of individuals to either justify or challenge the existing
   social and political system has significant practical implications. This
   research integrates system justification theory with a cross-cultural
   perspective to examine the impact and underlying mechanisms of
   interdependent self-construal on system justification. Studies 1a (N =
   201) and 1b (N = 205) demonstrated that interdependent self-construal
   correlated with higher system justification among both American and
   Chinese participants. Study 2 (N = 500) and Study 3 (N = 983) found that
   manipulation of an interdependent view of self-construal led to stronger
   system justification tendencies, and this effect was explained by an
   increased focus on collectivist values and respect for authority.
   Studies 4a (N = 278) and 4b (N = 836) further illustrated that the
   positive relationship between interdependent self-construal and system
   justification remained consistent even in low social mobility contexts.
   Taken together, the current research provides valuable insights into the
   cross-country differences in system justification and highlights the
   importance of incorporating cultural factors in future studies on system
   justification.},

Abstract = {This article identifies and unpacks the intrinsic potential for backlash
   in the pursuit of status symbols. While status loss has been associated
   with domestic pushback and reduced legitimacy for ruling governments,
   the literature on status is yet to examine how status-seeking can
   backfire even when a state can successfully claim to have acquired a
   status symbol. We contend that status backlashes are an inherent risk of
   status-seeking due to the multivocality of costly status symbols. Our
   heuristic framework for studying status backlashes proposes examining
   modes of critique that construe status symbols as irrational or
   unjustified costly endeavours, undermining their legitimating capacity
   and potentially even transforming them into a marker of stigma.
   Empirically, we identify three modes of critique present in reactions to
   Brazil's hosting of the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016.
   There, despite recognizing the symbolic value of hosting these
   mega-events, Brazilian audiences also criticized the government for the
   opportunity costs, vested interests and subservience that it entailed.
   Undertaking two shadow case studies - on the backlash against the United
   Kingdom's renewal of its Trident nuclear weapons system and Norway's
   engagement in military interventions between 1999 and 2012 - we document
   how these modes of critique associated with status symbols can travel
   across contexts.},

Abstract = {This research examines whether the village authority inventory norms
   regulated in Law Number 6 of 2014 concerning Villages (Village Law).
   have guaranteed or limited the sustainability of village autonomy. The
   object of the research is an analysis of village authority inventory
   arrangements in several districts or cities method is normative research
   with a statutory and conceptual approach. The study concludes, first,
   that the village authority regulation model has two sides, on the one
   hand, it has been regulated in various and different ways both in terms
   of the type and amount of authority, but on the other hand, village
   authority is still regulated in a minimalist way. Second, there are
   still problems in the identification and inventory procedures for the
   list of village authorities, which have no relevance to the
   sustainability of village autonomy. The various village authority
   regulation models are relevant to guarantee the consistency of village
   autonomy.},

Title = {Intended and unintended effects of cannabis regulation in Uruguay},
Journal = {POLICY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {553-570},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Ten years after Uruguay legalised cannabis, the country's experience
   provides valuable insights regarding the implementation of such a
   policy. Uruguay's regulation of cannabis represented an innovative
   policy based on a state-controlled model that yielded both expected and
   unexpected effects. To study these effects, we employed a qualitative
   research design and analysed six key outcome dimensions: accessibility,
   pharmacies, cannabis social clubs, quantity, prices and quality. The
   research included 23 interviews with key informants and 25 interviews
   with frequent cannabis consumers, complemented by secondary data
   analysis. We propose that the unintended effects of the policy, such as
   the formation of a `grey market' - the illegal distribution of legally
   produced cannabis - are attributable to: (1) the novel character of the
   regulation and, therefore, the lack of an evidence base to guide policy
   design and implementation; (2) the different preferences and policy
   dynamics that shaped the three different governments in office during
   the period; and (3) an implementation gap.},

Title = {Queering Syrian refugee crisis in Lebanon},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 28},
Abstract = {This essay explores the asymmetric impact of an emerging and
   increasingly normalized refugee crisis on LGBT+ politics/advocacy in
   risk societies through an intersectional lens. It adapts Crenshaw's
   three-dimensional forms of intersectionality as a framework to challenge
   the idea that refugee crises are exceptional. Drawing on informal
   conversations, published policies, reports, and news covered by invested
   parties, this ethnographic case study disrupts generalized hegemonic
   discourses on Lebanon's perpetual state of crisis that manipulates
   security construction and normalizes heteronational attitudes and ad hoc
   strategies that complicate the localization of global LGBT+ rights in
   times of crises. It contextualizes the resonance and/or alienation of
   global crises on local governance of queer Syrian refugee identities and
   agency. This study offers a complex understanding of LGBT+ politics and
   global crises in liquid modernity, where compounded forms of privilege
   and oppression shape the precariousness of queer Syrians' experiences
   and agency in the case of Lebanon.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of Brexit, the EU and the UK find themselves in an
   uncharted regulatory territory, similar to a divorced couple navigating
   the complexities of cohabitation. This article combines concepts from
   co-evolutionary theory with relational metaphors such as marriage,
   divorce, and co-habitation, offering a novel framework to analyse the
   unprecedented transition from EU member state to ex-member. The article
   uses food safety and gene editing regulations as case studies to
   illustrate the dynamics of this relationship. In food safety, both the
   EU and the UK maintain high standards rooted in past crises, reflecting
   a mutualistic co-evolutionary pathway. Conversely, in gene editing, the
   UK's pursuit of a more liberal regulatory framework represents a
   competitive co-evolutionary trajectory, prompting the EU to reconsider
   its regulatory stance. This analysis unveils the complex reality of the
   post-Brexit EU-UK regulatory relations, marked by a continuous process
   of adaptation and influence.},

Abstract = {Semiconductors are among the most important technologies for the digital
   society and a core technology of the European Union (EU)'s digital
   sovereignty agenda. The main argument of this article is that the
   governance of semiconductors is shaped by an inherent tension. On the
   one hand, this governance is embedded in the agenda of digital
   sovereignty, suggesting some form of autarky is possible. On the other
   hand, the production of semiconductors is necessarily globally
   distributed. This study draws on critical infrastructure literature,
   which enables us to explore how semiconductors are loaded with values
   that are inscribed via digital sovereignty. In the case of
   semiconductors, digital sovereignty works as a tool for legitimising
   trade, economic and research policies. The need for a strong
   semiconductor industry in the EU and the globalised nature of threats
   against the supply chain are acknowledged simultaneously. In turn,
   subsidising global corporations has turned out to be the natural
   response. Politically, it becomes difficult to contest these subsidies,
   as well as the underlying assumption concerning future innovation.},

Abstract = {While research on organised interests in Central and Eastern Europe has
   recently boomed, most studies focus on the micro-level, i.e.
   organisational development, and macro-level factors such as
   Europeanisation and democratic backsliding. So far however, little
   research has been dedicated to the meso-level, that is
   inter-organisational cooperation. We argue that inter-organisation
   cooperation in the region is driven by (a combination of) three central
   factors: organisational anxiety, democratic backsliding and
   Europeanisation effects. We draw on an original survey dataset of Czech,
   Polish, Hungarian, and Slovenian interest groups, which enables us to
   test our hypotheses with a view to the four country contexts.},

Abstract = {While gender quota and parity laws are increasingly popular worldwide,
   their introduction often causes controversy. Thus far, we lack an
   understanding of how the framing of these measures affects public
   opinion. We conducted a survey experiment in the UK and France (combined
   N = 2677) to identify the causal effect of framing on levels of support
   for the policy and potential backlash against women candidates.
   Comparing (1) gender quotas to increase women's underrepresentation and
   (2) gender parity laws to achieve gender balance, we find that overall
   levels of support are greater than opposition in both countries. Parity
   is more supported than quotas in France, but no such framing effects
   emerge in the UK. Respondents' gender also matters, with men less
   supportive of both measures than women. We find no evidence that either
   type of positive action measure increases backlash in the form of
   reduced support for hypothetical women candidates running under such
   measures.},

Abstract = {Using archival material from states, international organizations, and
   business actors, this paper explores how the Association for the
   Promotion and Protection of Private Foreign Investments (APPI), a
   transnational business interest association (BIA), liaised with
   different international institutions to lobby for better foreign
   investment protection. We zoom in on the United Nations, the
   Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the World
   Bank to examine how APPI influenced the global institutional landscape
   during its heydays from 1958 until 1974. We show that business actors,
   particularly oil and banking corporations, created APPI as a nimble,
   efficient alliance that could move faster than existing BIAs. We further
   demonstrate how companies ``forum shop{''} between different BIAs, and
   how APPI injected its ideas into the policymaking process, using the
   framework of the three faces of power. By shedding light on the role
   private business actors played in foreign investor protection, the paper
   contributes to a better understanding of the emergence of global
   economic governance in the second half of the 20th century.},

Abstract = {In public governance, power and accountability are inextricably linked.
   However, although an integrated exploration of these concepts could
   enhance our understanding of how governance operates, few studies have
   examined them together. Drawing on resource dependency theory, we
   suggest that power relationships within networks shape accountability
   and have a concomitant impact on the prevailing governance paradigm.
   Specifically, where principals possess important resources that enable
   them to exercise power over agents and hold them to account through
   hierarchical mechanisms, Traditional Public Administration approaches
   predominate. Where resources are diffused within elite networks in New
   Public Management contexts, individual actors can exercise greater power
   to achieve their objectives, and accountability arrangements become
   increasingly multidirectional and complex. Finally, if resources are
   shared across society as in the New Public Governance paradigm, actors
   generate power with each other to achieve shared goals, and
   accountability relationships are more horizontal with a focus on
   learning.},

Abstract = {How can multiple organizational, social, and political actors
   effectively address the contemporary challenges of digital political
   campaigning? We proceed by reviewing the increased theoretical and
   empirical importance of digital political campaigning. We discuss the
   new research advances in the field and acknowledge the necessity for
   interdisciplinary research given the rapidly evolving techniques and the
   imminent positive and negative risks of digital campaigning. We present
   a multi-level actor approach for dealing with the risks of digital
   political campaigning. We outline the contribution of this issue and
   identify relevant gaps for future research.},

   Contemporary Russia An Analysis of Expert Interviews},

Abstract = {This article reveals how the official patterns of commemorating the
   Soviet historical past in Russia match its local projections. Based on
   interviews with experts from 27 regions and some other field materials,
   the article maps the diversity of commemorative agendas across Russia.
   Focusing on the violent aspects of Soviet history, it outlines current
   configurations of the usable past important for local identity and
   notably used by regional authorities and other mnemonic actors over
   time. These repertoires of the usable past depend on the cultural
   infrastructure that was formed over time, but also on the efforts of
   mnemonic actors, who promote specific memories. This article argues that
   although regional approaches to commemorating the historical past are
   evidently dominated by the official federal narrative, local visions of
   common history are far from being uniform. The aspects that are
   downplayed or silenced at the federal level might be indispensable to
   regional and local identities. Expert interviews suggest that collisions
   between the narratives circulating at different levels typically do not
   escalate to open conflicts. The commemorative projects supported by
   regional authorities tend to conform to the federal-level framing, which
   is flexible enough to tolerate some local peculiarities. However, in
   many regions there are also non-state mnemonic actors who promote a
   commemorative agenda that deviates from the official state discourse.
   While being short of resources for developing memory hardware, they
   affect public discussions raising awareness about the downplayed aspects
   of the local past.},

Abstract = {Are states more interested in claiming territories that have economic
   resources? While previous theories of international relations assume
   that resources make a territory more tempting to claim, all else equal,
   I argue that certain types of economic resources can make states less
   willing to claim a territory. The presence of capital-intensive
   resources-such as oil or minerals-raises concerns about how the benefits
   of acquiring the territory would be distributed within the nation. These
   distributional concerns make it harder and costlier for leaders to
   mobilize widespread and consistent support for claiming resource-rich
   lands. Using original geocoded data on territorial claims in South
   America from 1830 to 2001, I show that states are indeed less likely to
   claim lands that have oil or minerals, even when they can be claimed for
   historical or administrative reasons. I then illustrate the theoretical
   mechanism through a case study of Bolivia, comparing Bolivian attitudes
   toward reclaiming its two lost provinces, the Chaco and the Litoral. By
   showing how the presence of economic resources can become a liability in
   mobilizing unified support, this paper questions the widespread
   assumption that resources make territories more desirable to claim.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a novel corpus containing all resolutions
   adopted by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) from 1946 to 2019,
   the network of citations between them, and an online tool for exploring
   them. Resolutions adopted by the organization provide a valuable record
   of the evolution of multilateralism and political ideas on the global
   stage. Given that resolutions typically cite past ones, the resulting
   network of references offers a wealth of information on the UNGA's most
   relevant themes over time. This article applies network analysis to the
   corpus of approximately 18,000 resolutions and 77,000 citations, aiming
   to answer questions such as: What are the most cited resolutions of all?
   Are there thematic clusters? And can we delineate historic patterns
   based on themes prioritized? Our findings show that leading resolutions,
   such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, stemmed from the
   early years of the UNGA and created cores around which thematic clusters
   emerged. We conclude by listing highly cited resolutions and prominent
   clusters, while also conducting a descriptive exploration of how some of
   the largest clusters formed. The dominant clusters addressed human
   rights, development, decolonization and peace and security, and by
   monitoring their evolution we offer a new, data-intensive account of the
   interaction between these topics since 1946.},

Title = {Some policies matter more: party salience and interest group access to
   political parties in Western democracies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {32},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1780-1803},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Political parties and interest groups play important roles in
   incorporating societal interests into democratic decision-making. Recent
   studies have analysed the causes of interactions between individual
   political parties and interest groups and of interest groups' choices to
   seek access to one or more parties. Meanwhile, we know less about why
   some parties grant access to a range of interest groups while others
   focus on a few. This article theorises about party strategies and
   suggests that party salience - that is parties' emphasis on different
   policy areas - affects the range of interest groups to which they grant
   access. I combine interest group survey data from six European
   democracies with data from party manifestos and use regression analyses
   to test this hypothesis. I find that parties provide access to multiple
   interest groups representing various interests in legislative politics
   and, above all, in policy areas that are salient to them. Thus, parties
   are more likely to be aware of diverse interests' perspectives on
   policies in areas they prioritise. The results have important
   implications for our understanding of the consequences of party-interest
   group interactions in democracies.},

Abstract = {This paper disentangles the complexity of using interviews to explore
   masculinities in post-conflict contexts. Deploying a practice-theoretic
   ontology, we see interviews as sites of multiple translations, each tied
   to one of the three stages of the interview process: preparing,
   conducting, and interpreting interviews. First, when preparing
   interviews, the abstract concept of masculinities must be translated
   into concrete issues. Second, when conducting interviews, these issues
   must be translated into interview questions. Third, interpreting
   interviews necessitates translating respondents' statements into
   practices. By disentangling this complex process, we provide strategies
   for successfully asking difficult, context-sensitive questions and reach
   an increased understanding of the asynchronous and unsteady ways in
   which masculinities change or persist during peacebuilding processes in
   politically and societally polarised contexts.},

Abstract = {We apply Anatol Rapoport's typology of war to reconstruct how Russian
   research communities explain war against Ukraine. We argue that the
   initial three-dimensional framework can be divided into two explanatory
   models: military-political and eschatological-cataclysmic. The first
   model explains the war with reference to classical calculus about
   military threats and national interests. The second model interprets war
   as an act of creating a new world order and as a struggle existential
   for Russia. These two models are not mutually exclusive, yet they
   illuminate evolution of meanings given for the war during the first two
   years of Russia's large-scale invasion against Ukraine.},

Abstract = {Recent analyses of radicalization processes have shown that extremist
   attitudes and violent behavior may be related in some cases, but are
   rarely collinear. It therefore benefits analysts of political violence
   to leverage tools that assist in the distinction of characteristics that
   might move an individual towards violence (vs. nonviolence) in support
   of their beliefs. To this end, the current study explores the efficacy
   of deep learning neural networks for classifying extremists as
   potentially violent or nonviolent based on dozens of common predictors
   derived from various perspectives on radicalization. Specifically, this
   study uses 337 predictors from the Profiles of Individual Radicalization
   in the U.S. dataset to populate a neural network with two hidden layers
   composed of four processing nodes. The model correctly predicted whether
   an individual engaged in violence (or not) in 94.2 percent of cases, on
   average. Analyses further identified several predictors that were most
   important in classifying violent and nonviolent cases. These analyses
   demonstrate neural networks may be effective tools in the study of
   radicalization and extremism, particularly regarding the disaggregation
   of salient outcomes.},

Abstract = {Do politicians behave opportunistically regarding their tax proposals
   during the election cycle, or do they maintain ideological sincerity? We
   examine U.S. governors' revenue proposals between the years of 1989 and
   2018 to assess gubernatorial behavior during election years. We find
   that governors, in general, do indeed follow a political budget cycle
   where they request lower revenues during election years. However, this
   finding is largely driven by Democratic governors asking for
   significantly lower revenues during election years when compared to
   non-election years. Republican governors are more ideologically sincere,
   maintaining behaviors that are consistent across the election cycle.},

Abstract = {In response to global compound risks, resilience has been incorporated
   into China's national governance discourse. This paper presents a
   quantitative analysis of 88 central-level policies building resilience
   capacity in China, to refine policy design to address complex risks more
   effectively. A comprehensive two-dimensional ``policy tool-application
   field{''} analysis framework is developed based on policy tool theory
   and employs bibliometrics and content analysis methods. By extracting
   210 policy analysis units corresponding to 289 coding reference points,
   we unveil the structural characteristics, policy themes, and
   distribution of policy tools on resilience building at the central
   level. Results show a notable upward trend in policy publication,
   forming a multi-agency policy-making network. We observe an imbalance in
   the structure of policy tools, with a strong reliance on
   environment-based policy tools. Policy tools are configured across all
   application fields. Supply-based policy tools are primarily applied for
   environmental and technological resilience, while demand-based tools
   find greater utilization in economic and organizational resilience
   dimensions. However, there is a neglect of social resilience. This paper
   recommends integrating policy tools to bolster resilience in diverse
   fields, and how to assess risks and their dynamic adjustments in
   resilience building as a significant direction in the future.},

Abstract = {We investigate the impact of UN peacekeeping on voluntary returns and
   negative attitudes towards displaced persons. We posit that peacekeeping
   missions can have beneficial effects by improving security and
   alleviating the socio-economic burden imposed by new arrivals on
   receiving communities. Focusing on the critical case of South Sudan, we
   combine information on peacekeepers' subnational deployment with high
   frequency survey data. Our findings suggest that the presence of
   peacekeepers is more likely to attract individuals seeking to return
   home, compared to those relocating for other reasons. In addition,
   peacekeepers positively influence the perceptions of receiving
   communities regarding the impact of IDPs and refugees on economic
   opportunities, security conditions, and social cohesion.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship on the evolution of neoliberalism points out that,
   despite free market discourse, right-wing rule has often resulted in
   re-regulation and further market concentration, to the advantage of
   large corporations. This article argues that such an outcome is not an
   inevitable result of right-wing incumbency. Instead, I identify an
   exogenous, demographic, change that prompts right-wing governments to
   increasingly embrace market concentration: the aging of the workforce,
   which has intensified the substitution of capital for labor, and as a
   result, somewhat paradoxically, reduced the amount of pure profits that
   can be distributed to wealthy households. In response, right-wing
   governments restrict competition to shore up pure profits. Drawing on
   data from 14 to 20 OECD countries, I show that as workforce aging
   intensifies, right partisanship becomes increasingly associated with
   more regulatory restrictions on competition, greater market
   concentration, and a greater pure profit share of income.},

Title = {The relationship between political legitimacy and economic legitimacy:
   empirical explorations of a novel research approach on legitimacy},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {The paper outlines key points of a novel research approach to
   empirically investigate the question of legitimacy in modern societies.
   This new research approach utilizes a functionalist perspective to
   expand the concept of legitimacy. Accordingly, the conceptual framework
   discusses how legitimacy can be employed in different domains of
   society. In particular, it proposes to conceptualize both the legitimacy
   of the political system (political legitimacy) as well as the legitimacy
   of the economic system (economic legitimacy). The main objectives of the
   study are to (1) develop conceptualizations that are empirically
   plausible for the two types of legitimacies; (2) to empirically verify
   the operationalization; and (3) to assess empirically the relationship
   between these two types of legitimacies and identify interdependencies
   between them. The paper employs a macro-level research design to
   understand the relationship between political and economic legitimacy,
   where the main units of analysis are countries. The study compiles a new
   country-level dataset of indicators for political and economic
   legitimacy based on a large selection of secondary cross-national data
   sources. It employs then structural equation modeling to established
   empirical measurement models for political and economic legitimacy.
   Moreover, the relationship of political and economic legitimacy is
   explored with a cross-lagged panel model. The paper establishes that
   political and economic legitimacy are two distinct concepts empirically.
   Furthermore, the empirical results indicate that political legitimacy
   has a negative influence on economic legitimacy, whereas economic
   legitimacy does not effect political legitimacy. Overall, the paper
   shows the viability of this new research approach and potential pitfalls
   for future research. The empirical evidence should be interpreted with
   caution due to low data quality, nonetheless the paper contributes to
   taking a step closer toward understanding how governments can ensure
   stable societies.},

Abstract = {Does the implementation of transitional justice (TJ) mechanisms such as
   trials, truth commissions, and institutional reforms reduce corruption
   by enhancing accountability, building trust, and creating a culture of
   deterrence? Although prior work has studied whether economic crimes
   should be included in TJ agendas, TJ's potential to address corruption
   has been mostly overlooked. On the one hand, theory suggests that TJ
   could reduce corruption; yet, on the other, it indicates that TJ
   mechanisms are not effective enough at solving deep-rooted corruption.
   Testing these opposing arguments using data from 106 postconflict
   countries that experienced conflict between 1946 and 2006, I find that
   the implementation of TJ and corruption are not statistically
   associated. However, when I further investigate this relationship with
   only ``well-implemented{''} TJ mechanisms, purges are found to be
   negatively associated with political corruption and amnesties are
   positively associated with regime corruption.},

Abstract = {Following years of intense protest, the negotiations for the TTIP
   agreement were declared `dead in the water' by the end of 2016. Although
   there has been ample scholarly attention on how Civil Society
   Organisations were able to politicise the issue, there is little
   evidence on how this politicisation ultimately impacted the
   policy-making process for the trade agreement. Building on an analysis
   of over 500 parliamentary questions in conjunction with in-depth
   interviews with eight MEPs from five different political groups, I show
   that the anti-TTIP campaigns reframed the problem definition of the
   agreement which led to a lasting shift of its policy image and changed
   the stance of some policymakers. Further, the anti-TTIP protests
   contributed to the salience of TTIP among the public and subsequently
   changed policymakers' perceptions of the attitudes of the public towards
   the proposed agreement. Finally, the protests created partisan as well
   as inter-institutional conflict on the issue.},

Title = {Türkiye-Greece-Cyprus, and the west: a Lacanian family portrait},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON SECURITY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 19},
Abstract = {This study examines the protracted Cyprus conflict by employing an
   Ontological Security Studies (OSS) framework enriched with the Lacanian
   psychoanalytic approach. In this context, the tripartite structure Lacan
   established between mother, father, and child is adapted to understand
   the years-long dispute over Cyprus. We argue that the two main reasons
   for this problem are 1) the unhealthily broken bond between the mothers
   (T \& uuml;rkiye and Greece) and the child (Cyprus), and 2) the child's
   inability to fully identify with the Name-of-the-Father (the West).
   Recognising the father's law, the child is freed from the mother's
   overwhelming presence and thus begins the process of subject formation.
   We assert that global politics shares similarities with what Lacan calls
   `symbolic' and that Cyprus' existence as an actor in this `symbolic'
   depends on its full separation from its mother(s), namely T \&
   uuml;rkiye and Greece, and by recognising the father's law. This study
   raises the question of what happens if this separation is not achieved.
   In other words, could Cyprus exist as a fully-fledged actor in global
   politics/symbolic in the shadow of two motherlands, T \& uuml;rkiye and
   Greece, which have not abandoned their `baby homeland'?},

Title = {Policy termination made easy? The emerging trend towards sunsetting
   antimicrobial resistance national action plans},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Abstract = {While policy termination is usually more difficult than continuity in
   domestic policymaking, the international process for addressing
   antimicrobial resistance (AMR) shows that sustaining commitments can be
   the more difficult path. Addressing persistent crises requires
   persistent policy responses across multiple countries. Policy
   coordination among many countries has gained significant scholarly
   attention whereas analyses of continuing, longer-term commitments of
   many countries to crisis response are less common. This paper remedies
   this shortfall by analysing the commitments of different countries to
   the international policy process against AMR. It triangulates novel
   evidence in the form of distinct indicators based on global surveys,
   content analysis of national action plans (NAPs), and publication
   patterns of second-generation NAPs. The findings suggest that national
   commitments to the international process initially reached high levels
   but are now in decline. Countries are effectively `sunsetting' their
   NAPs, and thereby ending commitments to the international process for
   addressing AMR. Many have refrained from renewing their NAPs, and those
   that do renew rarely show signs of learning or adaptation from previous
   NAPs. Hence, even in the AMR case, where a global and persistent threat
   rose high on the international political agenda, long-term commitment to
   the international response policy process is by no means assured.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of traditional authorities around
   protected areas in Africa, engaging with debates regarding the efficacy
   of traditional authorities in contemporary governance in Africa. Some
   scholars have supported such authority as epitomising African customs
   and practices, and thereby offering continuity and relevance. Others
   have questioned the usefulness and relevance of such authority in
   democratic spaces given their hereditary nature. The article considers
   these debates in relation to the challenges that arise due to protected
   areas being spaces of bifurcated governance, in contrast to other rural
   areas, utilising two case studies: Gwayi Forest in Zimbabwe and
   Dwesa-Cwebe Nature Reserve in South Africa. Protected areas pose
   challenges for post-colonial African states regarding how they should be
   governed. The article argues that it is time for states to bring
   finality over the governance of such areas. State institutions should be
   restricted to an advisory role in protected areas. Local populations
   should be able to choose their own leadership and governance over these
   spaces.},

Abstract = {The paucity of writing on the rapid collapse of local administration
   within several South African bantustans gripped by the upsurge of civic
   mobilisation in the late 1980s remains one of the lacunae of the
   country's late twentieth-century historiography. Land and governance
   within such enclaves had become a central issue as apartheid stirred up
   spatial and demographic calamity in its traumatic displacement and
   relocation of African households. The turning tide against the local
   administration of these reassembled human settlements during the 1980s
   disabled the vital cog of the state-appointed `tribal authorities'.
   Ciskei, which in the late 1970s was swiftly and arbitrarily consolidated
   under tribal authorities, was one of the bantustans caught up in the
   rising civic movement from the 1980s onwards. The overlying yet jumbled
   powers of such besieged tribal authorities, interfacing with the
   exuberant civic organisations throughout the 1990s, contributed to the
   advance of Lungisile Ntsebeza's scholarship around land and rural
   governance in South Africa. He investigated simple, yet germane,
   questions such as who governs in the bantustans and how essential land
   and allied resources were to such disputed control. In honouring
   Ntsebeza's scholarship, this article sketches out the history behind the
   overlying and muddled powers of these governing traditional authorities.
   It also explicates the myriad socio-political forces that underpinned
   the disputed nature of rural governance within the Ciskei Bantustan
   during the dying years of apartheid.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the causal factors behind the Brexit vote, aiming
   to contribute to the literature on European disintegration. It addresses
   how, amidst external factors such as the EU debt crisis and the 2015
   refugee crisis, pre-existing ideological forces deeply ingrained in a
   society can surface and steer a country's trajectory in relation to
   European integration. Employing a rigorous process-tracing design, it
   highlights the forces that led to the referendum and its outcome,
   identifying key patterns that can be extrapolated to comparable cases
   within the field of EU integration theory. The analysis operates at two
   levels: it scrutinizes the constraints faced by Cameron's government in
   the lead-up to the vote, and it probes the British electorate's attitude
   toward EU and how it was influenced by the Leave campaign. The study
   draws from an empirical case to identify some of the patterns of this
   ongoing political process.},

Abstract = {In recent years, scholars of migration have created several new
   immigration policy indexes, but most existing databases have limited
   temporal scope. They also focus, to a large extent, on the Global North.
   In this research note, we introduce the Historical Immigration Policy
   dataset (HIP), which begins to fill these gaps. We first provide an
   overview of the data and then describe how they offer new insights into
   immigration policy. We make three empirical observations. (1) On
   average, democracies are less open to immigration than authoritarian
   states but grant resident migrants more rights. (2) European states were
   open to immigration earlier than standard accounts of global migration
   assume. (3) Historically, openness to immigration and inclusive rights
   for resident migrants have often been complements, not substitutes.
   En los \& uacute;ltimos a \& ntilde;os, los acad \& eacute;micos en el
   campo de la migraci \& oacute;n han creado varios \& iacute;ndices
   nuevos referentes a pol \& iacute;ticas de inmigraci \& oacute;n. Sin
   embargo, la mayor \& iacute;a de las bases de datos existentes tienen un
   alcance temporal limitado. Adem \& aacute;s, los acad \& eacute;micos
   tienden a centrarse, mayoritariamente, en el norte global. En esta nota
   de investigaci \& oacute;n, presentamos el conjunto de datos de la Pol
   \& iacute;tica Hist \& oacute;rica en materia de Inmigraci \& oacute;n
   (HIP, por sus siglas en ingl \& eacute;s), que representa un primer paso
   para llenar estos vac \& iacute;os. En primer lugar, proporcionamos una
   visi \& oacute;n general de los datos. A continuaci \& oacute;n,
   describimos c \& oacute;mo estos ofrecen nuevas perspectivas sobre la
   pol \& iacute;tica de inmigraci \& oacute;n. Realizamos tres
   observaciones emp \& iacute;ricas: (1) Como norma general, las
   democracias est \& aacute;n menos abiertas a la inmigraci \& oacute;n
   que los Estados autoritarios, pero otorgan m \& aacute;s derechos a los
   migrantes residentes. (2) Los Estados europeos estaban abiertos a la
   inmigraci \& oacute;n antes de lo que suponen los relatos habituales en
   materia de migraci \& oacute;n mundial. (3) Hist \& oacute;ricamente, la
   apertura a la inmigraci \& oacute;n y los derechos inclusivos de los
   migrantes residentes han sido, con frecuencia, complementarios y no
   sustitutivos entre ellos.
   Ces derni \& egrave;res ann \& eacute;es, les chercheurs qui travaillent
   sur les migrations ont cr \& eacute;\& eacute; plusieurs nouveaux index
   de politiques d'immigration, mais la port \& eacute;e temporelle de la
   plupart des bases de donn \& eacute;es est limit \& eacute;e. Elles se
   concentrent aussi en grande partie sur les pays du Nord. Dans cette note
   de recherche, nous pr \& eacute;sentons l'ensemble de donn \& eacute;es
   Historical Immigration Policy (HIP, ou Politique d'immigration
   historique), qui commence \& agrave; combler ces lacunes. D'abord, nous
   proposons un aper \& ccedil;u des donn \& eacute;es, puis nous d \&
   eacute;crivons comment celles-ci offrent de nouveaux renseignements
   concernant la politique d'immigration. Nous formulons trois observations
   empiriques. (1) En moyenne, les d \& eacute;mocraties sont moins
   ouvertes \& agrave; l'immigration que les \& Eacute;tats autoritaires,
   mais accordent davantage de droits aux migrants r \& eacute;sidents. (2)
   Les \& Eacute;tats europ \& eacute;ens se sont ouverts \& agrave;
   l'immigration plus t \& ocirc;t que le supposent les r \& eacute;cits
   habituels sur les migrations mondiales. (3) D'un point de vue
   historique, l'ouverture \& agrave; l'immigration et les droits inclusifs
   des migrants r \& eacute;sidents se compl \& egrave;tent souvent, au

Abstract = {The indigenous women's movement in Latin America and the Caribbean in
   the second decade of the 20 1 century revolutionized the discipline of
   International Relations (IR), by reinterpreting the
   theoretical-methodological frameworks in their desire to understand the
   diplomatic world. From a critical perspective, Mexican indigenous women
   continue to demonstrate the impor tance of becoming aware of rituals as
   performative acts that re-signify institutional structures, norms, and
   order in redefining the vision of global governance. Incorporating new
   methodological approaches based on the ethics of care and reciprocity in
   violent scenarios, this article responds with the method of critical

Abstract = {The social links between community entities are frequently regarded as a
   valuable asset for local economic development. Opinions diverge
   regarding the particulars of social capital and its constitution within
   social relations, despite its fundamental nature coming from these
   connections. Diverse public and private activities, according to Putnam
   (1995b), could constitute local social capital. While social capital can
   be conceptualized as private relations, assessing and debating it from
   the standpoint of local governments presents a formidable challenge. The
   distinction between the public and private spheres regarding the
   character of human activities was advanced by Arendt (1958). This study
   aims to frame the possible indicators for measuring local social capital
   by adopting Arendt's classical theory. By applying it to the social
   capital of the social communities, the research fills a gap in the
   discussion between public and private spheres. The integrated framework
   theoretically provides a backbone for the distinguished perspectives of
   social capital in different levels of human activities. As well as
   categorizing manageable and non-manageable indicators, it also provides
   practical policy implications for the criteria local governments place
   an emphasis on for managing the level of social capital in a region. It
   is anticipated that the framework will advance the expansion of the
   theoretical literature on social capital by identifying measures at two
   distinct levels: individual and collective characteristics.},

Title = {``If Foreign, Then Cleaner{''}: Individual Corruption Perceptions and
   Support for Free Trade in Developing Nations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {68},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {Extant literature on public opinion in international political economy
   documents the role that domestic corruption perceptions play in the
   formation of mass attitudes toward a range of integration-related
   foreign policies. Based on this precedent, we conjecture that corruption
   perceptions also affect opinions toward free trade. We build on a
   heuristic approach to attitude formation where individual perceptions of
   corruption among the political elite trigger positive attitudes toward
   foreign countries, firms, and products, what we refer to as a
   ``foreignness cue.{''} This cue drives individuals with high perceptions
   of corruption to be more supportive of free trade. Based on survey data
   from eighteen Latin American countries, we demonstrate that higher
   levels of perceived domestic corruption are associated with greater
   support for free trade. Causal mediation analysis provides additional
   evidence that positive attitudes toward foreign countries and firms are
   a conduit through which the corruption perceptions effect operates. We
   also offer evidence of external validity of the main effect by analyzing
   additional surveys on a distinct set of less and more developed
   countries. Our heuristic-based model of support for free trade
   complements theories based on material self-interest as a basis for
   attitude formation in the realm of trade policy.
   La literatura existente con relaci \& oacute;n a la opini \& oacute;n p
   \& uacute;blica en la econom \& iacute;a pol \& iacute;tica
   internacional documenta el papel que desempe \& ntilde;an las
   percepciones de corrupci \& oacute;n interna sobre la formaci \&
   oacute;n de actitudes de las masas hacia una serie de pol \&
   iacute;ticas exteriores relacionadas con la integraci \& oacute;n. Con
   base en este precedente, conjeturamos que las percepciones en materia de
   corrupci \& oacute;n tambi \& eacute;n afectan las opiniones relativas
   al libre comercio. Partimos de la base de un enfoque heur \&
   iacute;stico en materia de formaci \& oacute;n de actitudes en el que
   las percepciones individuales de la corrupci \& oacute;n entre la \&
   eacute;lite pol \& iacute;tica desencadenan actitudes positivas hacia pa
   \& iacute;ses, empresas y productos extranjeros, lo cual podemos
   denominar como una ``se \& ntilde;al de extranjer \& iacute;a.{''} Esta
   se \& ntilde;al provoca que las personas que tienen unas mayores
   percepciones en materia de corrupci \& oacute;n tienden a ser m \&
   aacute;s partidarias del libre comercio. Demostramos, sobre la base de
   los datos obtenidos de encuestas realizadas en dieciocho pa \&
   iacute;ses de Am \& eacute;rica Latina, que los niveles m \& aacute;s
   altos de corrupci \& oacute;n interna percibida se asocian con un mayor
   apoyo al libre comercio. El an \& aacute;lisis de mediaci \& oacute;n
   causal proporciona evidencia adicional de que las actitudes positivas
   hacia pa \& iacute;ses y empresas extranjeras son un conducto a trav \&
   eacute;s del cual se articula el efecto de las percepciones de corrupci
   \& oacute;n. Tambi \& eacute;n ofrecemos pruebas de la validez externa
   del efecto principal mediante el an \& aacute;lisis de encuestas
   adicionales en un conjunto distinto de pa \& iacute;ses, tanto menos
   desarrollados como m \& aacute;s desarrollados. Nuestro modelo heur \&
   iacute;stico de apoyo al libre comercio complementa las teor \&
   iacute;as basadas en el inter \& eacute;s material propio como base para
   la formaci \& oacute;n de actitudes en el \& aacute;mbito de la pol \&
   iacute;tica comercial.

Title = {Digital practices for consumer e-participation in economic regulation

Abstract = {How do national regulatory agencies (NRAs) use digital practices to
   empower consumers for e-participation in regulatory processes? To
   address this question, we designed a novel framework to comprehensively
   capture digital practices adopted by NRAs across the key regulatory
   procedures, including consumer information provision, communication,
   education, and rule-making, which we conceptualise as two-way relational
   mechanisms. To measure the scope of digital regulatory practices, we
   derived composite digital scores for 236 NRAs across 42 EU and OECD
   countries, based on coding the regulators' websites and social media
   accounts. We also developed a new multidimensional construct of
   organisational capacity to explain the variation in the adoption of
   digital regulatory practices among NRAs with sole - and multi-sectoral
   competencies in five economic markets, ranging from utilities to
   financial services. Our findings show significant regional divergence in
   the adoption of digital regulatory practices by NRAs from the old and
   new EU member states, as well as the significant effect of NRA's reform
   experience, resources allocations, sectoral competencies, and in-house
   capabilities on their digital scores. This study offers implications for
   both improving the effectiveness of regulatory procedures through
   consumer-oriented digital transformation, as well as government
   initiatives for enhancing digital trust and e-participation in economic
   regulation among consumers.},

Abstract = {Chinese central government uses top-down land quotas as a key tool for
   limiting urban expansion. Faced with the benefits of land development,
   how will local governments respond to centralised quotas? We established
   a framework for multidimensional local government competition to explain
   quota implementation. This framework includes vertical competition for
   fiscal revenue and quotas, horizontal competition for economic growth
   and political promotion, competition between former and subsequent local
   leaders for recognition of their leadership and temporal distribution of
   land finance revenue and government debt and competition with landowners
   as well as developers for land appreciation income and tax revenue. We
   argue that these types of competition and their spill-over effects drive
   local governments to strengthen land-centred urbanisation, resulting in
   the failure of quotas to restrain urban expansion. Our findings help to
   improve the understanding of local governments' strategies for urban
   spatial development and centralised urban growth management.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic brought the issue of immigrant irregularity to the
   public fore, exposing undocumented migrants' vulnerabilities and the
   reliance of supply chains on their `essential work'. While
   pro-regularisation instances emerged in several countries, governments
   responded differently to them. Delving into the political determinants
   of immigrant regularisation programmes, the article compares the cases
   of Italy and Spain, traditionally considered as `hallmarks' of the
   `Southern European immigration model'. The findings suggest that the
   types of actors that mobilised and the arguments they invoked, and
   governments' opportunities and constraints in the national and
   supranational arena were central to explain why Italy approved a
   collective regularisation and Spain did not.},

Abstract = {Did the financial and economic crisis (2008/2009) induce a permanent
   shift to more economic intervention in the advanced democracies? Three
   relevant theoretical perspectives are considered. First, the crisis
   could have led all governments to intervene more, irrespective of their
   partisan composition. Second, voter demand could have shifted towards
   more intervention due to the crisis, again inducing all governments to
   expand economic intervention. Third, increasing salience of economic
   issues could have led to an accentuation of partisan differences in
   economic policy which should have led to an expansion of economic
   intervention under left governments only. We present data from a new
   index of economic intervention, which show that governments increased
   economic intervention during the immediate crisis but returned to
   liberalization afterward. Similarly, statistical analyses show that
   partisan differences disappear during the acute crisis but return
   thereafter. Hence, the financial and economic crisis did not constitute
   a game-changer in economic policymaking in advanced democracies.},

Abstract = {The discipline of International Relations is defined by a fundamental
   tension between history and fiction. On the one hand, historical
   approaches are crucial in tracing the origins of international order,
   contextualising key concepts, and uncovering marginalised voices. On the
   other, the discipline is invariably caught in its own mythologies, which
   shape what is ``real{''} and ``true{''} in global politics. Instead of
   treating the ambiguous distinctions between history and fiction as
   problems to be definitively resolved, this Special Issue takes up these
   tensions as generative for understanding, manoeuvring, and even
   disrupting and (re)imagining the field of IR. Examining these dynamics
   from several perspectives - from the writing of history to the political
   force of fictional imaginaries - the articles in this Issue show that
   the relation between history and fiction is a constitutive force of the
   international, in both theory and practice. Bringing together historical
   and critical perspectives, the Issue elucidates how ideas of history and
   fiction, reality and storytelling, facticity and imagination shape and
   are in turn shaped by world politics. Historical approaches to IR, we
   argue, can do much more than adjudicate between these amorphous
   categories. Here, we pursue the possibilities.},

Abstract = {Collaborative networks are gaining momentum in research and practice as
   a tool to solve complex problems and create public value. While being
   characterised as self-regulating and relatively autonomous,
   collaborative networks have been widely recognised to need
   metagovernance to drive their collaborative process forward. However,
   limited attention has been paid to how metagovernors exercise power
   without undermining the capacity of collaborative networks to solve
   collective problems. To contribute to this knowledge gap, we develop a
   new theoretical framework based on a cumulative power perspective in the
   context of the metagovernance of collaborative networks. We outline
   three modalities of metagovernance (output, input and process) through
   which metagovernors can exercise power by structurally privileging
   either their own interests or those on whose behalf they metagovern. We
   apply the theoretical framework to a Danish case study of collaborative
   networks in sustainable housing. Through this case, we showcase the
   repressive and constructive features of power in the metagovernance of
   collaborative networks. A key research finding is that metagovernors can
   improve their awareness of how to balance constructively and
   repressively exercising and distributing power in collaborative networks
   by understanding the power dynamics entangled in the different
   modalities of metagovernance.},

Abstract = {Public employees' whistleblowing is an effective anti-corruption means
   because they can provide rigorous evidence of wrongdoing in public
   organizations. However, whistleblowing may cause risks to the
   individuals and their organization, which discourage them from
   reporting. While the topic has been understudied, a few studies have
   adopted the theory of planned behavior (TPB) from psychology to gain
   insights into whistleblowing. However, these studies have overlooked the
   unique characteristics of the public sector and the contextual factors
   surrounding whistleblowing. Our research aims to fill this gap by
   incorporating these missing elements into the theoretical framework and
   thus developing an adapted TPB. Using survey data from Taiwan, this
   study provides empirical evidence to support the adapted TPB in
   explaining the intention of public employees to blow the whistle.},

Abstract = {This article aims to examine the emergence of a system of multi-level
   governance in Higher Education quality assurance during recent decades
   in Spain, as a particular case within the European Space of Higher
   Education. Although there is a well-established multi-level structure in
   the governance of this area at the European level, it is not very common
   to find countries having an internal multi-level configuration. Most
   countries have allocated quality assurance at the national level, either
   concentrating responsibilities into a single agency or allowing
   competition between accreditation bodies. Thus, the Spanish scenario
   stands out as very singular model for the governance of Higher Education
   quality assurance, deserving attention to comprehend the intricacies of
   its coordination. Here we examine its development over the last two
   decades, and discuss three factors that have shaped inter-agencies'
   relations: first, the sequence of agency creation and their accumulated
   expertise; second, the role of institutional structures for multi-level
   coordination; and third, informal practices related to
   inter-governmental relations, and the influence of country
   administrative traditions. From discussing this case, this article
   identifies three key lessons for understanding agency relations in
   multilevel governance environments: first, path dependence significantly
   impacts-regulatory interactions over time; second, the Administrative
   culture, particularly centralist traditions, considerably shapes
   relationships in multi-level bodies; and, third, the coordination models
   in regulatory networks (hierarchical, network or market-based) tend to
   reflect those underlying political dynamics.},

Abstract = {This study examines the decline of the Pashtuns as a nationalist group
   in Afghanistan. It also focuses on the fundamentalist narrative of
   Pashtun converted into Taliban. The Taliban has used the Pashtun to
   support their hardcore Islamist ideology. The authors argue that Pashtun
   declined due to the Taliban's strong beliefs in their extreme doctrine
   in Afghanistan. The article also focuses on identity and polarisation in
   Afghanistan and the role of minority groups in the country. The analysis
   of the article revolves around discourse from the historical
   perspectives related to the decline of Pashtuns. This article focuses on
   Pashtun, Taliban, and other minority groups using historical secondary
   data.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the phenomenon of blended legacies. It is defined
   as the local synthesis of foreign guerrilla warfare traditions that the
   FARC-EP adopted to gain the advantage in their own war. We focus on
   Vietnamese influence within FARC-EP. The text tracks three types of
   connections between the FARC-EP and the guerrilla warfare legacies:
   first, early influence of Vietnamese and Maoist guerrilla political,
   strategic and tactical literature, as well as Soviet influence through
   the Colombian Communist Party; second, training in Vietnamese methods
   from secondary and tertiary parties, particularly instruction the M-19
   and ELN received in Cuba and El Salvador respectively that they later
   passed on to the FARC-EP; and third, direct training the FARC-EP
   received in Vietnam in 1990. The text also demonstrates the local
   synthesis through an analysis of the FARC-EP special forces development,
   as well as their use of improvised explosives.},

Abstract = {This research highlights a neglected paradox of migration policies:
   whereas narratives on migrants as a security threat in their countries
   of destination find little support in empirical studies, forcing
   migrants to return may increase violence and crime back home. Using
   migrants' exposure to deportation threats at destination as an exogenous
   source of identification, this paper traces the long shadow of
   immigration enforcement on violent crime in Mexico, recipient of more
   than 3.5 million deportees from the US over the period 2000-2015.
   Enforced return is associated with more homicides and a stronger
   presence of cartels in migrants' municipalities of origin, as well as a
   higher sense of insecurity among the population and a higher probability
   of being assaulted. Identifying these local effects of enforced return
   are a first step towards unpacking the various direct and indirect
   channels through which immigration enforcement generates unintended
   negative outcomes in migrants' communities of origin.},

   policy design and instrument choices. As the literature on policy advice
   has shown, such advice arises from many different actors interacting
   with each other often over relatively long timeframes. Actors within
   these `policy advisory systems' operate within the confines of an
   existing set of political and economic institutions and governing norms,
   and each actor brings with them different interests, ideas and
   resources. Studying who these actors are, how they act and how their
   actions affect the overall nature of the advice system and its contents
   are critical aspects of current public policy research. But not all
   these elements have been equally well conceptualised or studied,
   especially those concerning their impact on the quality of policy advice
   emerging from a system. In this article, the general nature of policy
   advisory systems is set out, their major components described and a
   model of individual and organisational behaviour within them outlined
   inspired by a modification of the `exit, voice, loyalty' rubric of
   Albert Hirschman. Our findings show how aggregated individual
   organisational behaviour along the lines suggested by Hirschman can over
   time result in very different kinds of advice being provided by an
   advisory system, with predictable consequences for its nature and
   quality.},

Abstract = {Many of the most pernicious contemporary urban problems require local
   governments to organise collectively across jurisdictions and reorganise
   or coordinate internally across bureaucratic silos. Climate change, for
   example, is a complex system phenomenon impacting a range of
   interconnected socio-environmental systems in a region, such as water,
   transportation and energy infrastructures which may not be directly
   under the control of a single department or government. This often
   requires managers and policymakers to coordinate policy responses across
   siloed units within governments and through network-based arrangements
   across governments. Theories of polycentricity and collective action
   have long drawn attention to the barriers and opportunities of
   collaboration and multilevel governance in fashioning adequate responses
   to complex problems. However, these approaches typically fail to
   explicate the relationships or interactions between internal and
   external collaboration risks and the institutional mechanisms for
   ameliorating them. This article empirically explores this relationship
   between functional collective action (collaboration across departmental
   units within a single government) and intergovernmental collective
   action (collaboration across governments). Situated in the context of
   climate adaptation and electric vehicle (EV) policy efforts in cities,
   the article highlights the need for greater scholarly attention more
   broadly to the development of institutional collective action theory.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to evaluate the influence of
   budgeting process elements (budget participation, preparation,
   implementation and evaluation) on budget performance of
   government.Design/methodology/approachA cross-sectional survey was
   administered among budget officers from government agencies,
   departments, and units in Malaysia. Descriptive and regression analyses
   were used to examine the relationship between the budgeting process and
   budget performance.FindingsThe findings revealed the significant
   influence of the two predictors: (1) budget participation and (2) budget
   implementation and evaluation, on budget performance. Both have positive
   and significant impacts on budget performance. However, budget
   preparation appeared to have no significant relationship with budget
   performance, although there is positive effect.Originality/valueThis
   study provides empirical evidence on the budgeting process factors that
   influence budget performance. The findings hopefully are of interest to
   government officials, especially frontline bureaucrats, who seek to
   ensure that budget performance meets expectations in Malaysia and other
   countries.},

Title = {A tale of two crises: affective polarization in Greece},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {Affective polarization, the strong feeling of animosity toward the
   supporters of the opposite party is rising in Europe. Several studies
   have examined the impact of ideological extremity and partisanship as a
   social identity on the rise of affective polarization. However, the
   impact of policy preferences on affective polarization remains
   relatively unexplored. I am at filling this gap by examining how
   preferences towards measures taken at addressing both the economic and
   the health crises impact affective polarization. Using newly collected
   data from Greece, a country with historically high levels of affective
   polarization, the analysis reveals that both policies have an impact of
   affective polarization but there are asymmetries on how policy
   preferences influence it. For the supporters of the governing
   conservative party, affective polarization appears to be policy-driven,
   whereas for the supporters of the opposition, the populist left-wing
   party SYRIZA, it is predominantly ideology-driven. Interestingly, the
   supporters of the governing party continue to align with the
   pro-memorandum stance even in the absence of an actual memorandum.},

Abstract = {Alex Garland's Civil War, which depicts journalists covering an American
   civil war in the near future, is a beautifully shot and stealthily
   clever film. It is also a strategic warning about a gruesome political
   outcome that is no longer beyond imagining. Garland does not articulate
   precisely why or how this civil war, under way for several years, might
   have arisen. He presumes, credibly, that audiences who have watched
   bedrock norms of political civility trashed in a toxically divided
   America will understand. In the movie's world, the MAGA rebellion that
   the 6 January 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol purported to foretell
   has been provisionally successful, and the president faces a
   counter-rebellion by the so-called Western Forces - an improbably
   plausible alliance between California and Texas. Garland is thinking the
   unthinkable out loud in hopes of motivating people to avoid it, and
   seeking to prepare the next generation for a protracted struggle even if
   it does not descend into full-blown civil war.},

Abstract = {The year 2023 witnessed the political ``marriage made in heaven{''}- the
   so-called UniTeam coalition between the Marcos-Romualdez and Duterte
   dynasties- endure serious strain. A battle for political supremacy
   between the two political clans appears to be brewing, leading to the
   rise and fall of prominent political personalities belonging to or
   allied with each side. This political contest, however, has not
   distracted Filipinos completely from the very real social and economic
   problems and difficulties they con- tinue to face despite high hopes
   that, with the COVID-19 pandemic officially declared over, things would
   take a turn for the better. Top on the list of concerns among Filipinos
   was the rising price of basic needs like food, transportation, and
   health. Relieving them of the burden of high and rising costs will play
   a large part in deciding the outcome of any political contest that may
   arise in future between the Marcos-Romualdez and Duterte dynasties.},

Abstract = {This study examines the effectiveness of collaborative platforms in
   supporting local collaborations for natural resource management. It also
   explores how governmental and non-governmental lead organizations adopt
   differing collaborative implementation approaches and how these
   variations influence outcomes. Utilizing a natural experiment and a
   difference-in-differences estimator, we evaluate if the Department of
   Energy's Clean Cities program functions as a collaborative platform to
   foster local-level Clean Cities Collaborations across the US, thereby
   improving air quality. Our findings suggest that Clean Cities
   Collaborations have a substantial and enduring impact on reducing air
   pollution. A series of subgroup analyses suggests that these
   environmental improvements are most noticeable in collaborations led by
   non-profits and regional government councils, rather than those directed
   by state and local governments. A complementary content analysis
   provides exploratory evidence that issue definition, collaborative group
   structure, and inclusive decision-making processes are crucial
   managerial factors that contribute to the environmental improvements.
   These insights pave the way for more effective management of
   collaborative governance on a larger scale.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the crises of neoliberal globalisation since
   the 2000s have given rise to a new transnational political family that
   we call `national-conservatism'. Through a critical examination of the
   literature on the Global Right and the role of the state under
   globalisation, we contend that national-conservatism acts as an
   innovative model for acquiring and exerting power from the right today,
   characterised by an endorsement of the state's economic role, an
   emphasis on traditional values and hierarchies such as religion, and a
   proactive, occasionally confrontational stance in foreign policy.
   Consequently, the paradigm of national-conservatism prompts the division
   of transnational neoliberalism into discrete national domains. These
   domains function as havens where the neoliberal elite is shielded both
   from foreign competitive pressures and radical demands of respective
   national societies. Crucially, national-conservatism garners legitimacy
   for this new order through its commitment to revitalising traditional,
   hierarchical models of national sovereignty.},

Abstract = {This research explores the mechanisms through which member states
   informally shape staffing decisions in the United Nations, extending the
   traditional view of influence beyond mere structural power within
   international organizations. Interviews with UN officials uncover three
   primary informal governance tactics: leveraging financial contributions,
   nurturing social networks, and fostering educational and institutional
   pathways for grooming candidates. These strategies subtly impact UN
   staffing, policy development, and access to sensitive information. The
   study points to the UN's structural challenges, such as reliance on
   voluntary funding and decentralized administration, which, coupled with
   the intertwined interests across organizational levels and the lack of
   effective oversight mechanisms, enable member states' informal
   influence. This environment not only restricts the involvement of
   developing countries but also undermines the UN's legitimacy and
   effectiveness. The findings illuminate the intricate dynamics of power
   within IOs, underscoring the need for a comprehensive understanding of
   influence and its implications for global governance.},

Title = {The impact of policy legacies on the implementation of Citizen Income in
   Italy: A policy feedback perspective},
Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {42},

Pages = {276-290},

Abstract = {The Citizen Income (Reddito di cittadinanza-RdC) is the most extensive
   program to fight poverty ever adopted in Italy. RdC is a Minimum Income
   Scheme that grants a cash amount to beneficiaries but obliges some
   specific groups to participate in active measures and in social
   inclusion programs. After 4 years of implementation, RdC seems not to
   have fully achieved its goals and scholars blame policy legacies as one
   of the main causes of its failures. Drawing on the literature on policy
   feedback, the paper proposes an analytical framework that identifies the
   mechanisms related to resources, incentives, and meanings affecting
   policy actors (public administration, organized civil society, and
   citizens). The framework is then applied to the case of RdC to detect
   through what specific mechanisms deriving from past anti-poverty,
   active, and social policies impacted on the implementation of the RdC.
   The paper is moreover aimed at advancing the debate about policy
   legacies and their effects on current policies through the elaboration
   of a framework specifying the mechanisms through which policy feedback
   produces change or stability.},

Abstract = {Are individuals who obtain their news from online news sources or from
   social media more likely to fear terrorism? If so, why is this the case?
   Based on the 2021 Chapman Survey of American Fears, this study draws two
   key conclusions. First, subjects who more frequently use online and
   social media news sources exhibit higher levels of fear of terrorism.
   Second, the relationship between online and social media news reliance
   and fear of terrorism is mediated through conspiratorial attitudes.
   These findings are robust to the inclusion of a host of demographic and
   attitudinal control variables.},

Abstract = {Unemployment hysteresis, where joblessness persists even after economic
   improvement, reveals the lasting impact of initial downturns. We delve
   into this puzzle in Morocco from 1999Q1 to 2019Q3, using four methods to
   examine the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) time
   series for unit root causes. Across all methods, we consistently find a
   hysteresis effect. We also explore how inflation and NAIRU interact,
   although results are mixed. This suggests policies focusing on reform,
   training, and learning could help reduce long-term joblessness. Our
   findings shed light on unemployment's enduring effects, even during
   recoveries, hinting at possible shifts in job markets. Our study
   contributes to global science by examining labor market hysteresis in
   Morocco, offering insights into policy implications for both Morocco and
   other developing nations. By examining how economic policies impact
   unemployment over time, we provide valuable guidance for policymakers
   grappling with similar challenges. Our research underscores the need to
   consider local contexts when crafting effective economic policies for
   developing economies.},

Abstract = {As a basic premise of this article, it is noted that the concept of the
   Global South cannot be analyzed solely on the basis of economic
   considerations. On the contrary, this presents a broad category, which
   calls into question political, economic, historical, identity and
   epistemic factors. Therefore, the general aim pursued by this research
   is to offer a concrete and multidimensional approach to identify and
   recognize, through three axes (political, economic and cooperative role)
   the actors of the Global South, taking into consideration the inherent
   dynamism of the term and highlighting its heuris tic relevance as a
   valid and relevant tool to understand the current configuration of
   power.},

Abstract = {This article aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the incident
   notification tool, a key component of post-incident recovery in Italian
   cybersecurity policy. The article presents a theory-based evaluation
   using the realist synthesis method to reconstruct the assumptions
   underlying the tool's operation and test its implementation. Our results
   reveal that the tool's effectiveness is based on its dual role as an
   alerting system and a learning mechanism. However, its performance
   varies, depending on factors such as the ability of the actors involved
   and the capacity of the administrations. Recommendations are proposed to
   improve the design and implementation of the tool, emphasising the need
   for corrective measures to ensure its effectiveness in both alerting and
   facilitating post-incident learning.},

Abstract = {In 2012, 20 years after the end of the 16-year war between Renamo and
   the Frelimo-led government, Mozambique witnessed the resumption of armed
   confrontations between the two former belligerents. The renewed
   hostilities ended in 2019 when Renamo and the government signed the
   Maputo Accord for Peace and Reconciliation, hailed as a `global
   exemplar' of liberal conflict resolution. Nevertheless, the peace
   process occurred in the context of increasing autocratisation in the
   country. Accordingly, this article examines the implications of
   authoritarian politics for an ostensibly liberal peacebuilding process.
   It argues that while the ruling elites resist attempts at building
   liberal peace, authoritarian conflict management has been complicated by
   state incapacity and the resistance of liberal actors. Therefore, the
   article concludes that attempts at rebuilding peace in a context of
   entrenched tensions between liberalisation and autocratisation in
   Mozambique delivered a precarious peace.},

Title = {Foreign policy strategies of Nepal between China and India: bandwagon or
   hedging},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 28},
Abstract = {Nepal, a landlocked country situated between two nuclear states, has
   found bandwagoning with either China or India to be an impractical
   option. In the current scenario, Nepal has opted for a trend of hedging
   with both neighbors while adhering to a non-alignment foreign policy.
   Nepal aims to seek economic and infrastructure development opportunities
   from Beijing through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative,
   which could help overcome geopolitical challenges. However, India is
   concerned about Nepal's growing relations with China, viewing it as a
   significant threat to India's interests in Nepal. Nepal remains
   committed to the principles of non-alignment in its foreign policy
   objectives. India perceives Nepal's current trend of hedging as a
   potential path toward future bandwagoning with China, given China's
   superior capabilities compared to India.},

Abstract = {This article is a comparative study of the influences that
   consociational democracies have on political mobilization. By drawing on
   theories on collective action, social movements and ethnopolitics, it
   offers a novel explanation of how the consociational political system
   affects oppositional political mobilization. The nature of the political
   system has a strong causal relationship with the identity of the
   political mobilization. While some political systems generate national
   oppositional political mobilization, consociational democracies create a
   divisive environment that prevents cross-sectarian mobilization. Three
   case studies were examined to test the theory: Iraq, Lebanon and Iran.
   These countries share many similarities in terms of economic conditions,
   and social diversity but differ in political mobilization. While
   political mobilization in Iraq and Lebanon has mostly represented a
   particular sect within the society at different intervals, Iran, by
   contrast, witnessed more nationalistic political movements.},

Abstract = {In October 2022, the EU and Morocco signed an unprecedented Green
   Partnership on Energy, Climate, and the Environment. The new deal aims
   to advance the external dimension of the European Green Deal and is
   expected to become a model for similar partnerships with other
   countries. In this study, we aim to explore the Moroccan perceptions of
   the Partnership. We utilize a thematic and content analysis of 31
   official documents, including media, along with semi-structured
   interviews with 22 key Moroccan stakeholders, not only representing the
   official authorities, but also businesses and academia. Results reveal
   that while the official political narrative emphasises the Partnership's
   benefits, divergent opinions emerged from our analysis, raising various
   concerns, especially regarding perceived benefits for Morocco and its
   sustainable development.},

Abstract = {What are the downstream effects of rebel governance on the demand for
   reform in post-conflict settings and their perceived legitimacy? Through
   an analysis of Kuwaiti civil society's engagement in rebel governance
   during the Iraqi 1990-1991 occupation of Kuwait, the study shows that
   engaging in rebel governance in contexts of occupation increases civil
   society groups' claims on their states, in which they update framing and
   increase their demands for greater participation after liberation.
   However, the perceived legitimacy of such demands is predicated by the
   public's experience of rebel governance. Namely, those who experienced
   the alternative governance structure provided by resistance rebels
   demonstrate greater support of post-war activism and demand for
   political participation. The paper seeks to contribute to the literature
   on the impact of rebel governance on post-war democratization by
   specifically focusing on groups operating within contexts of occupation,
   in impacting post-war political behavior. Unlike previous studies
   regarding rebel governance, the organizations on which this study
   focuses are neither secessionist nor center-seeking. Rather, resistance
   rebels seek the return of the state-however, on their own terms.},

Abstract = {This article examines the governance norms of micro-regional
   cross-border cooperation (CBC) in Europe and Southeast Asia. We ask why
   world-wide cross-border micro-regional institutions, though at first
   sight pursuing similar economic and socio-political objectives, markedly
   differ in their institutional design. Guided by arguments derived from
   sociological institutionalism, we argue that cross-border institutions
   adopt the governance norms of the regional organization to which they
   are linked. Accordingly, while in Europe CBC is characterized by
   normative ideas, supranational tendencies tamed by subsidiarity,
   bottom-up processes, liberal participatory norms and legal formality,
   Southeast Asian cross-border institutions are more material,
   intergovernmental, hierarchical, state-controlled and informal.
   Cross-border regions established in countries acceding to a regional
   organization localize the latter's governance norms if these deviate
   markedly from entrenched extant normative arrangements. The diversity of
   CBC in the two world regions studied suggests that the `varieties of
   regionalism' concept also applies to micro-regionalism.},

   Convention},

Abstract = {Can prosecutions by US authorities help spread enforcement of foreign
   bribery laws to other countries? In this article, we explore this
   question by re-examining earlier scholarship that found that US
   prosecutions of foreign corporations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices
   Act (FCPA) increase the likelihood that the corporation's home state
   will enforce its own foreign bribery laws. Using a conditional-frailty
   Cox model that allows us to model foreign bribery enforcement actions as
   repeat-events, we do not find evidence that FCPA prosecutions lead to
   sustained increases of foreign bribery enforcement by target countries.
   We also find that prior results are not robust to the inclusion of an
   important confounding variable: a country's level of exposure to
   corruption in their trading partners. Still, while our findings indicate
   a more limited role of US law enforcement in this area, we nonetheless
   see many promising avenues for future research on transnational law
   enforcement and its consequences.
   \& iquest;Pueden los enjuiciamientos por parte de las autoridades de los
   Estados Unidos ayudar a extender a otros pa \& iacute;ses la aplicaci \&
   oacute;n de las leyes contra el soborno extranjero? En este art \&
   iacute;culo, estudiamos esta cuesti \& oacute;n reexaminando un estudio
   anterior, que hab \& iacute;a concluido que los enjuiciamientos, por
   parte estadounidense, de acusados extranjeros, en virtud de la Ley de Pr
   \& aacute;cticas Corruptas en el Extranjero, aumentan la probabilidad de
   que el Estado de origen del acusado haga cumplir sus propias leyes
   contra el soborno extranjero. Utilizamos un modelo de Cox de fragilidad
   condicional, el cual nos permite modelar las acciones de aplicaci \&
   oacute;n de la ley contra el soborno extranjero como si fueran eventos
   repetidos, y concluimos que esta relaci \& oacute;n, que se hab \&
   iacute;a publicado en estudios anteriores, no se sostiene. Tambi \&
   eacute;n concluimos que los resultados anteriores no son robustos debido
   a la inclusi \& oacute;n de una importante variable de confusi \&
   oacute;n: el nivel de exposici \& oacute;n de un pa \& iacute;s a la
   corrupci \& oacute;n por medio de sus socios comerciales. De todos
   modos, si bien nuestras conclusiones indican que las acciones de
   aplicaci \& oacute;n de la ley de los Estados Unidos juegan un papel m

Title = {Mass Emigration and the Erosion of Liberal Democracy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {In many regions of the world, liberal politics is on the retreat. This
   development is usually explained with reference to inherently political
   phenomena. We propose an alternative explanation, linking democratic
   backsliding to deep-reaching demographic change caused by mass
   emigration. We argue that because migrants tend to be more politically
   liberal, their departure, if quantitatively significant, can hurt
   liberal democracy. Empirically, we focus on Central and Eastern Europe
   (CEE). Since 2004, the region has lost about 9 percent of its population
   due to migration to Western Europe. Drawing on data from 430,000
   individuals and a panel analysis, we show that CEE migrants
   systematically hold more liberal values than non-migrants and that their
   exit went along with a deterioration of democracy in their home
   countries. Further analyses show that the mechanism we describe
   generalizes to various other world regions. Mass emigration may pose a
   challenge to democratic development in migrant-sending countries around
   the globe.
   En muchas regiones del mundo, la politica liberal esta entrando en una
   fase de retroceso. Este desarrollo suele explicarse con referencia a
   fenomenos inherentemente politicos. Proponemos una explicacion
   alternativa, vinculando este retroceso democratico con el profundo
   cambio demografico causado por la emigracion masiva. Argumentamos que,
   debido a que los migrantes tienden a ser mas liberales politicamente, su
   partida, si esta es cuantitativamente significativa, puede llegar a
   danar la democracia liberal. De manera empirica, nos centramos en Europa
   Central y Oriental (ECO). Desde 2004, la region ha perdido alrededor del
   9 por ciento de su poblacion debido a la migracion hacia Europa
   occidental. Demostramos, partiendo de datos obtenidos de 430.000
   personas y de un analisis de panel, que los migrantes procedentes de
   Europa central y oriental tienen, de manera sistematica, valores mas
   liberales que los no migrantes, y que su salida acompano a un deterioro
   de la democracia en sus paises de origen. Otros analisis muestran que el
   mecanismo que describimos se puede generalizar a otras regiones del
   mundo. La emigracion masiva puede plantear un desafio para el desarrollo
   democratico en los paises emisores de migrantes de todo el mundo.
   Dans nombre de regions du monde, la politique liberale recule. On
   explique souvent cette evolution par reference a des phenomenes
   intrinsequement politiques. Nous proposons une autre explication, et
   relions le retour en arriere democratique a un changement demographique
   important cause par l'emigration de masse. Nous affirmons qu'etant donne
   que les migrants ont tendance a se montrer plus liberaux sur le plan
   politique, leur depart, s'il est d'une importance quantitative, peut
   nuire a la democratie liberale. Sur le plan empirique, nous nous
   concentrons sur l'Europe centrale et de l'Est (ECE). Depuis 2004, la
   region a perdu environ 9 pour cent de sa population a cause de
   l'emigration vers l'Europe de l'Ouest. En nous appuyant sur des donnees
   issues de 430 000 personnes et d'une analyse de panel, nous montrons que
   les migrants de l'ECE presentent systematiquement des valeurs plus
   liberales que les non-migrants, et que leur depart s'est accompagne
   d'une deterioration de la democratie dans leur pays natal. D'autres
   analyses montrent que le mecanisme que nous decrivons s'applique aussi a
   d'autres regions du monde. L'emigration de masse pourrait presenter un
   defi au developpement de la democratie dans les pays d'ou sont issus les
   migrants dans le monde.},

Abstract = {This article examines the Chinese government's stance on the
   Russia-Ukraine war, including the recent development of China's economic
   relations with Russia. It assesses the factors that have influenced
   Beijing's position and the narrative it has used to explain it.
   Considering China's outsized importance for global events, the article
   also explores what implications its positioning regarding the war can
   have for the future of the global order. Since Russia's invasion began,
   China's government has presented itself as a neutral party, but it has
   de facto adopted a pro-Russian position in the conflict. Beijing has
   primarily framed its stance on Ukraine in security terms, embedded in
   what is essentially a Realist narrative interlinked with pre-existing
   ideological worldviews among China's political elites. It has condoned
   Russia's invasion on the grounds that Moscow is defending its
   `legitimate security interests', which is an implicit appeal to respect
   a great power's sphere of influence, even at the expense of smaller
   states' sovereignty. While this raises questions about the compatibility
   of Beijing's vision of global order with the broader interests of most
   other states of the Global South, China (alongside Russia) has
   intensified its efforts to court these states in the context of the
   Russia-Ukraine war.},

Abstract = {In a backsliding democracy, antidemocratic politicians often vilify
   nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and impose restrictions that make
   it harder for them to form, advocate, or obtain funding. Do citizens
   consider NGOs as a threat? Do they support regulatory measures to
   restrict NGO activities? We focus on two factors that may influence
   citizens' attitudes toward NGOs: these groups' reliance on foreign
   funding and their ideological leaning. In a preregistered survey
   experiment in Israel, we find that citizens perceive foreign-funded NGOs
   as slightly more threatening, but they are not more likely to support
   restrictions on these groups than on groups relying on local funding.
   The ideological bent of the NGOs has a much stronger effect: People
   perceive NGOs on the other side of the political aisle as more
   threatening and support restrictions on their activity. Antidemocratic
   leaders might exploit this type of partisan-motivated reasoning to
   silence civil society.},

Abstract = {Property has a ubiquitous presence in international practice, but its
   implications for theorizing world order are not adequately explored. I
   remedy this by showing how property constitutes the core concepts of
   anarchy and sovereignty in international relations (IR) as overlapping
   spaces of right-based governance. I develop my account of a
   property-based world order in relation to the work of John Locke. Locke
   is generally overlooked as a core IR thinker, with the unfortunate
   consequence that anarchy and sovereignty are conceptualized as polar
   opposites under the enduring shadow of Hobbes. Even prominent critics of
   Hobbesian anarchy rely on Hobbesian notions of sovereignty, resulting in
   minimalist conceptions of international society and international
   ethics. To counter these Hobbesian legacies, I turn to Locke's limited,
   plural, and fluid accounts of anarchy and sovereignty and show how they
   are grounded in a normative notion of property that mutually constitutes
   them. This provides an alternative to the Hobbesian absolutist
   conceptions of anarchy and sovereignty that many IR theorists still
   operate with. The result is a distinctly normative vision for IR that
   condemns the twin evils of conquest and tyranny.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Does anxiety affect how public officials process policy information? It
   is often argued that the increasing number of policy failures can be
   explained by a lack of policy learning by decision makers. While
   previous studies show that socioeconomic and partisan variables are
   related to the perception of policy information, little attention has
   been paid to the role of emotions, such as anxiety, in the policymaking
   process. In this paper, we investigate the impact of anxiety on the
   policy learning of local office holders at the individual level in
   Switzerland. We introduce the Marcus' Affective Intelligence Model-which
   examines how emotions affect individuals' information processing-to the
   policy learning literature. To test the expectations of the model, we
   draw on novel experimental data collected among local elected officials
   from the 26 Swiss cantons. In the experiment, we randomly display
   anxiety-inducing images along with policy information. We provide
   evidence that anxiety has a positive causal effect on learning.
   Considering potential moderators of this effect, we show that the
   relationship is not conditioned by the strength of priors or the
   perceived complexity of public policies. However, these variables are
   substantially correlated with policy learning. Our findings have
   important implications for better understanding how information
   influences policymaking.},

Abstract = {In 2021, the European Union (EU) started to use material sanctions to
   punish democratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland. This policy change
   presents a puzzle for the existing literatures on international
   responses to backsliding. We theorise two distinctive processes that can
   account for why EU policy changed from inaction to enforcement. First,
   once the issue of backsliding in a member state has attained public
   salience across the other member states, their mainstream parties face
   domestic electoral incentives to support sanctions against illiberal
   governments abroad. Second, once backsliding governments also disrupt
   intergovernmental policy cooperation and threaten common policies at the
   EU level, even those actors who had been reluctant to defend EU values
   become more inclined to use sanctions. We demonstrate the plausibility
   of our explanation with evidence, first, of the increasing public and
   electoral salience of backsliding in other EU member states, and second,
   of the occurrence of a negative intergovernmental spillover through
   increasing attacks by backsliding member state governments against
   common policies.},

Abstract = {Building on calls for more analyses of constructions of gender within
   extremist groups, this study examines Australian neo-Nazis' construction
   of hegemonic masculinity on the digital media platform, Telegram.
   Undertaking a keyword co-occurrence analysis of 3,279 posts and a
   qualitative analysis of 624 posts from 6 Australian neo-Nazi Telegram
   Channels, we empirically validate how Australian neo-Nazis use this
   media platform to idealise a strong, white and combat-ready masculinity.
   This masculinity is centred on protecting `vulnerable' white women and
   girls from non-white men and simultaneously casts alternative
   masculinities, in particular those associated with the LGBTQIA +
   community, as weak and deviant.},

Abstract = {Numerous studies have delved into the intricate dynamics of
   representative bureaucracy in public service provision, yet a
   significant gap exists in our understanding of the distinctions between
   top leaders and members of the top management team (TMT). Using the
   panel data of 317 subdistricts in Beijing, this research revealed that
   top female leaders have stronger influences on public service delivery
   than female TMT members. Top female leaders handle citizens' complaints
   better than their male counterparts, while the effect of TMT gender
   representation is nonsignificant. This research underscores the
   imperative need to differentiate between the representative roles of top
   leaders and TMT members, thereby revealing nuanced effects in the realm
   of gender representation.

Abstract = {In May 2022 Finland and Sweden took the historical decision to apply for
   membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). One month
   later, after a three-decade long opt-out, Denmark voted overwhelmingly
   in a referendum to join the European Union (EU) common defence policy
   (CSDP). Combining organised hypocrisy with post-functionalism, the
   article focuses on the normative and pragmatic concerns underlying
   states' interaction with international institutions. Empirically, the
   article analyses the long-term political-institutional dynamics between
   Nordic countries, the EU CSDP and NATO since the end of the Cold War,
   and how they have been reshaped by the crisis provoked by the Russian
   attack on Ukraine.},

Title = {The policy feedback effects of preemption},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {52},
Number = {2},
Pages = {235-255},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Scholars have charted a dramatic rise in the use of preemption both at
   the federal and state levels since the 1970s, with courts and
   politicians from both parties enacting preemptions across a range of
   contentious issues. Thus, preemption is a critical feature of American
   policymaking-one that almost certainly shapes the political choices of
   policymakers, organized interests, and voters across levels of
   government. Despite its significance to the politics of policymaking,
   scholars have yet to systematically consider the political consequences
   of preemption. We apply the logic of policy feedback theory to create a
   framework for analyzing the political consequences of preemption.
   Specifically, we detail how the use of both federal-state and
   state-local preemption might produce unique resource and interpretive
   effects that shape the subsequent political behaviors of policymakers,
   organized interests, and the public. We then consider two illustrative
   cases-federal preemption of state consumer financial protections and
   state preemption of local gender identity anti-discrimination
   statutes-to demonstrate our framework's application. The article
   addresses a gap in the preemption literature and provides a critical
   extension of policy feedback theory, proposing a research agenda for
   future work to help better understand the politics of a widely used
   policy tool.},

Abstract = {Junior ministers are very common in coalition governments. Existing
   research argues that parties assign junior ministers to satisfy the
   office goals of coalition partners or as a mechanism to manage
   delegation costs. This article aims to reassess this argument. Using
   interviews, personal calendars, coalition agreements and an original
   data set on junior ministers in Israel, it finds that junior ministers
   are engaged in policymaking either on general issues under the
   ministry's jurisdiction or issues that are salient to their party.
   Although rival junior ministers have the capacity and the incentive to
   monitor the minister, they do so only on the margins, either because
   they do not need to, or because they focus on safeguarding their
   policymaking autonomy. Finally, all junior ministers assist the minister
   and represent the ministry.},

Title = {Reinvigorating Social Support Systems in Rural Northwestern Ghana:
   Towards Affective Empathy in a Neoliberal Age},
Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {122},
Number = {489},
Pages = {513-531},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Scholars frequently allude to the concept of a supportive extended
   family system that provides a lifeline to less privileged members of
   society, such as the indigent and the aged. Yet, the extended family and
   the network of support it enables have come under immense threat from
   neoliberalism. This article examines the constrained role of the
   extended family system and its implications, based on residential
   ethnographic fieldwork data gathered in rural northwestern Ghana. It
   draws on transnational discourses on empathy and local conceptions of
   interdependence and unity as encapsulated by African communitarian
   philosophies such as Ubuntu and Te jaa bonyeni of the Waala people of
   northwestern Ghana to explore how to generate empathy. Neoliberal
   individualist values have intensely undermined the support networks of
   the extended family system. Te jaa bonyeni philosophy, similar to
   Ubuntu, and many humanistic philosophies, offers important opportunities
   for reinvigorating debates on African indigenous support networks as
   important steps towards nurturing affective empathy. This study
   contributes to discourses on affective empathy by connecting it to
   communitarianism. Cultivating empathy is necessary towards imagining
   forms of existence that are dignifying for the marginalized and
   preventing them from descending into abysmal deprivation.},

Abstract = {Global public-private partnerships (PPPs) have become prominent in
   efforts to address global challenges, particularly in the health field.
   In the scholarly literature, global PPPs have been conceptualized as
   arenas for voluntary public-private cooperation rather than agents of
   global governance. This paper challenges this approach, arguing that a
   sub-class of highly institutionalized partnerships have developed into
   transnational bureaucracies that, much like international organizations,
   can draw from their administrative capacities to exercise agency and
   gain and consolidate authority over time. To substantiate this argument,
   I present an in-depth analysis of five global health partnerships that
   played a leading role in the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator
   (ACT-A), the initiative that sought to coordinate the global response to
   covid-19. Based on extensive document review and analysis of the ACT-A
   PPPs -Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
   Tuberculosis and Malaria, The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness
   Innovation, Unitaid, and The Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics -
   I show how these partnerships' leadership role during the pandemic
   emerged from a decade long build-up of PPP agency. These organizations
   gained administrative capacities that enabled them to increase their
   authority vis-a-vis their donors, boards, and other external actors
   through three interlinked strategies: (a) developing greater financial
   autonomy; (b) expanding their mandates (including toward pandemic
   preparedness and response); and (c) establishing inter-partnership
   cooperation and mutual representation to other forums. My analysis
   suggests the need for future research to consider highly
   institutionalized PPPs as agents of global governance and to explore
   empirically and theoretically the consequences of their rising
   authority.},

Pages = {53-79},
Abstract = {This chapter identifies the structure of the space in which the
   institutional choices for Europe are made in the post-Maastricht period.
   This common space allows us to examine propositions and hypotheses on
   the fundamentals of political leaders' preferences, their strategies at
   interstate bargains, and the outcomes of their institutional choices in
   the post-Maastricht period. The findings show that political leaders
   pursue country-specific office-seeking and party-specific policy-seeking
   interests, which shift at times of government changes. Vote-seeking
   political leaders with referendum threat are particularly powerful at
   Amsterdam and Nice, where outcomes reflect the lowest common
   denominator. However, the higher uncertainty by more referendum
   announcements in Lisbon leads to institutional choices for Europe with
   the risk of failure and inefficiency.},

Abstract = {This chapter investigates the propositions and hypotheses on
   supranational camp-building in EU policy-making as another major
   consequence of the institutional choices for Europe, which transform the
   supranational game of party competition in the post-Maastricht period.
   After a short introduction of the research design and the data on party
   positions, the analysis identifies the critical juncture of the divide
   about European integration in the national game of party competition.
   This divide consolidates in EU policy-making with supranational
   camp-building of pro-and anti-integrationist camps with few moderates in
   between. The voting patterns of the European Parliament confirm this
   proposition and reveal cohesive support of the proposals of the European
   Commission by the groups of mainstream/ruling parties, which are
   rejected by those of challenger/periphery parties.},

Title = {EuroLat's failure to act as an international moral tribune over
   Venezuela: a critical analysis of its Co-Presidents Declarations
   (2014-2023)},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Academic literature on interregional institutions, including
   inter-parliamentary ones, argues that all (should) defend and promote
   democracy and human rights. Post-plenary co-presidents' declarations
   represent the cornerstone of the EuroLatin American Parliamentary
   Assembly (EuroLat). It is therefore surprising that the Venezuelan
   conflict does not appear in several of them. In fact, Venezuela has
   often acted as an impediment to producing such common positions. Or, if
   cited, hardly any condemnation of the appalling human rights situation
   in that country is mentioned. Therefore, our study will argue that this
   represents an important EuroLat failure in condemning human rights and
   democratic abuses in that country. To illustrate this, our study
   consists first of an empirical analysis of what has happened over that
   issue in the past decade. Then, the second part explains the
   disagreements between EuroLat<acute accent>s two components, its
   European and its Latin American ones. The conclusion summarizes our
   findings and provides possible avenues for future research.},

Abstract = {Objective/context: To present the Departmental Political Female
   Representation Index (IRFED). This tool allows contrasting spatially and
   temporally the way in which women's descriptive representation has
   developed between 1992 and 2018. The IRFED helps to analyze how
   institutional and regional factors affect women's descriptive
   representation at the departmental level; and, likewise, the impact of
   descriptive representation on the recognition of women's rights at the
   spatial level can be evaluated. Methodology: Using data collected from
   the National Civil Registry on the election of women in different
   departmental bodies, a principal component factor analysis was carried
   out to construct an index that captured the level of representation that
   women obtained in each of the departments of Colombia between 1992 and
   2016. This index was analyzed to show how some institutional factors
   influence women's access to public power. Conclusions: The IRFED is
   capable of showing two things: first, variations in descriptive
   representation of women in spatial and temporal terms; and second, the
   heterogeneous effect of institutional changes promoting women's entry
   into elected positions in different regions. Originality: The IRFED
   contributes to understanding the political representation of women in
   elected positions by decentralizing the discussion from national
   representation institutions.},

Abstract = {The prominence of global megatrends and the emergent literature on
   threats, risks and vulnerabilities show that these two phenomena are
   arguably not mutually exclusive. This betrays, however, a lack of
   understanding about how these challenges are conceived by the scientific
   community from a more comprehensive perspective. This paper assumes that
   it is possible to identify the presence of turning points in world
   politics, focused on the analysis of threats and risks and the detection
   of citation bursts, which reflect new perspectives and emergent research
   fields using big data. I provide a systematic analysis based on
   bibliometric techniques, involving more than 6800 publications from the
   Web of Science over the last four decades. This paper addresses the
   following questions: what are the main areas of research on global
   threats and risks? What is the role of Western and emerging countries in
   this process? What are the most influential papers, countries and
   languages regarding the study of threats and risks? And how does this
   emergent literature connect to the understanding of discursive practices
   and turning points?},

Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {82},
Number = {2},
Pages = {177-191},
Abstract = {After 1948, Norway became one of Israel's closest friends. The fate of
   the Palestinians did not arouse any interest. After the war in 1967,
   these attitudes changed. Israel had become an occupying power. The
   Palestinian refugee problem remained unresolved. The PLO had also
   changed its policy and advocated for a two-state solution. Nevertheless,
   Norway had the most restrictive policy towards the PLO in all of Western
   Europe. It was not until 1986 that the PLO received an information
   office in Norway. In 1989, Norway made its first official visit to the
   PLO in Tunis. Throughout the 1980s, the Labour Party was the driving
   force behind the new Norwegian policy. It was built on the new trust
   relationship with the PLO and the close relationship with Israel. In
   1993, Norway negotiated the Oslo Accords. Norway's close relationship
   with Israel had made it possible. The PLO also realized that it needed a
   friend of Israel. However, there was no longer strong sympathy for
   Israel in Norway. Norway's role forced Norway to pursue a policy
   acceptable for Israel. Only during the Gaza War in 2023 has Norway been
   at the forefront internationally in efforts to end the war and initiate
   negotiations for a two-state solution.},

   Theory and Evidence From China},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {73},
Number = {4},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {While extensive research has delved into various factors shaping vote
   choice in democratic elections, few have investigated vote choice in the
   semi-competitive elections, where the ruling party typically secures
   unequivocal victory. But the noteworthy phenomenon of independent
   candidates winning votes and even seats in these elections at the local
   level suggests that vote choice in autocracies merits scholarly
   attention. This study examines China's local congressional elections
   using a mixed-methods research design that integrates case studies and a
   conjoint experiment. We find evidence in support of valence voting:
   long-term constituency service increases vote share by strengthening
   popular preference and reducing electoral repression and manipulation
   faced by independent candidates. Our finding suggests that constituency
   service is an effective strategy of persuading and mobilizing voters in
   semi-competitive elections, shedding light on a nuanced relationship
   between incumbents and challengers in weakly institutionalized regimes.},

Abstract = {This study examined discourse on democracy among leaders of the Chinese
   Communist Party (CCP) during the reform era. It explored the meanings
   conveyed by the leaders when they mention the term ``democracy{''} and
   analyzed their usage of democratic narratives throughout this period. A
   keyword-counting method was employed to extract phrases containing the
   term ``democracy{''} from selected works of four top CCP leaders. The
   results reveal a strong alignment between the meanings of democratic
   phrases and three proposed narrative dimensions. By highlighting
   leaders' discursive patterns, which reflect both continuity and change,
   this study explained how leaders' strategically use democratic
   narratives to maintain their ruling legitimacy. The study enhances the
   understanding of the CCP's political narratives and contributes to
   broader research on resilient authoritarianism and comparative
   authoritarianism.},

Title = {Public education, multinational citizenship, and territorial legitimacy:
   analyzing the 2004 and 2023 Ontario curricula on Indigenous peoples},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Month = {DEC 24},
Abstract = {Through an analysis of the Ontario public school curriculum grounded in
   normative analytics drawn from philosophical theories of territorial
   rights and state legitimacy, this paper investigates the role of public
   education in promoting and/or undermining the conditions for the
   formation of multinational identities among the members of the
   (English-speaking) majority group in Canada. That is, it investigates
   compulsory public education curricula for the potential to transmit
   representations that furnish students with the resources for forming
   beliefs and attitudes that recognize Canada to be a treaty federation of
   distinct peoples with rights to territory and self-determination. As the
   paper argues, under present conditions in the Canadian context, public
   education with a mind to producing a multinational ethos is a
   requirement of political legitimacy. As we will see, there is evidence
   to suggest that public education is undergoing a transformation in
   Canada's largest province with respect to its treatment of contemporary
   Indigenous presence, historical treaty-making, and the history of
   colonial wrongdoing - although serious omissions remain, notably in the
   areas of Indigenous governance, and consent and consultation. The
   results of curricular evolution can thus be expected to remain ambiguous
   with respect to the ideals of territorial legitimacy and treaty
   federalism, alongside the problematic discursive arena provided by the
   national news media and other sites of identity formation.},

Abstract = {Why do states that simultaneously support rebel groups in each other's
   intrastate conflicts enter negotiations to resolve such mutual
   interventions? This is an important question, as negotiations between
   interveners typically lead to negotiated settlements, which in turn tend
   to make their intrastate conflicts far less deadly. We argue that
   international crises make negotiations more likely. Crises raise the
   costs of intervention and often lead potential mediators to put pressure
   on states to negotiate. Using new monthly data on mutual interventions
   in Africa, the article shows that crises are indeed significantly
   associated with the likelihood that negotiations will occur. This
   finding is robust to using fixed effects and matching. The article
   contributes to the literature by investigating a widespread though
   little-studied type of conflict, as well as by studying the impact of
   state leaders' crisis perception using a quantitative research design,
   which helps overcome a methodological limitation seen in previous
   studies.},

Abstract = {Despite strong international condemnation, there is growing acceptance
   of internet shutdowns as a legitimate response to online content that
   governments-particularly in Africa-find concerning. This article
   explores government decision-making around internet shutdowns during
   contentious periods such as elections and in situations of violent
   conflict. In arguing for a reading of shutdowns that goes beyond simply
   seeing them as a blunt tool of censorship, it discusses the underlying
   issues, including the vast inequalities between Big Tech companies based
   in the United States or China and resource-poor countries in the Global
   South. Building on this, the article probes the intensifying disputes
   around who writes the rules governing how social media companies address
   harmful content, how such rules are implemented, and, finally, what this
   means for the postcolonial state in Africa. In some contexts, a
   government's use of shutdowns represents an effort to reassert
   sovereignty amid a longstanding context of contestation around borders,
   power, and national identity.},

Abstract = {Extractivism has contributed to update Reason of State doctrines in
   Latin America since the mid-2000, translating cold-war categories - like
   that of the `internal enemy' - into new ones better adapted to
   `reconciliation' meta discourses. While the securitisation of extractive
   conflicts in Colombia builds on a well-established counterinsurgency
   expertise, emerging claims and mobilisations - around environmental
   issues, Indigenous rights and territorial autonomy - have also forced
   significant adaptations. This opened opportunities for extractive norm
   entrepreneurs to disseminate Canadian innovations for the management of
   the social environment surrounding extractive projects. These
   innovations can be summarised in two parts: 1. The subordination of law
   to practices of engagement and communication between companies and local
   communities through so-called Corporate Social Responsibility
   mechanisms; and 2. The projection of a moral imperative of transparency
   on communities and social actors. Beyond the strictly operational level,
   these normative innovations also articulate a specific kind of
   politico-legal doctrine aimed at mitigating the destabilising effects of
   emergent rights claims and neutralising the emancipatory potential of
   law. In this paper, we provide historical antecedents for the
   development of these innovations in Canada, analyse how norm
   entrepreneurs disseminate this doctrine between Canada and Colombia, and
   look at its implications for democratic uses of law.},

Title = {Does Public Opinion on Foreign Policy Affect Elite Preferences? Evidence
   from the 2022 US Sanctions against Russia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {69},

Abstract = {Does public opinion on international affairs affect elites' policy
   preferences? Most research assumes that it does, but this key assumption
   is difficult to test empirically given limited research access to elite
   decision-makers. We examine elite responsiveness to public opinion on
   sanctioning Russia during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. We
   fielded a preregistered experiment within the 2022 TRIP survey of US
   foreign policy practitioners, offering a rare opportunity for a fairly
   large elite survey experiment (\$N = 253\$). We used contemporary public
   polling highly supportive of increasing sanctions as an information
   treatment. Our research design, involving a salient issue and real-world
   treatment, substantially expands on previous work. Exposure to the
   treatment raises elite support for increasing sanctions from 68.0
   percent to 76.3 percent (+8.3 pp.). While meaningful, this effect is
   smaller than those identified elsewhere. We argue that this difference
   is driven by pretreatment dynamics related to issue salience and ceiling
   effects and is therefore all the more notable. We provide evidence for
   substantial treatment effect heterogeneity depending on subject-matter
   expertise, degree of involvement in political decision-making, and
   gender, but not party identification. While our results support previous
   research, they highlight issues of external validity and the
   context-dependence of elite responsiveness.
   \& iquest;Tiene la opini \& oacute;n p \& uacute;blica en materia de
   asuntos internacionales alg \& uacute;n efecto sobre las preferencias
   pol \& iacute;ticas de las \& eacute;lites? La mayor \& iacute;a de las
   investigaciones asumen que s \& iacute;, pero esta importante suposici
   \& oacute;n es dif \& iacute;cil de probar emp \& iacute;ricamente
   debido al acceso limitado que tienen los investigadores a los tomadores
   de decisiones de \& eacute;lite. Estudiamos la respuesta por parte de
   las \& eacute;lites a la opini \& oacute;n p \& uacute;blica en materia
   de las sanciones a Rusia durante la invasi \& oacute;n de Ucrania por
   parte de Rusia en 2022. Llevamos a cabo un experimento prerregistrado
   dentro del marco de la encuesta TRIP (laboratorio de investigaci \&
   oacute;n de ense \& ntilde;anza, investigaci \& oacute;n y pol \&
   iacute;tica internacional) 2022 de profesionales de la pol \&
   iacute;tica exterior de EE. UU., lo que nos ofrece una oportunidad \&
   uacute;nica para llevar a cabo un experimento de encuesta de \&
   eacute;lite con una muestra bastante grande (N = 253). Utilizamos las
   encuestas p \& uacute;blicas contempor \& aacute;neas que apoyaban el
   aumento de las sanciones como tratamiento de la informaci \& oacute;n.
   Nuestro dise \& ntilde;o de investigaci \& oacute;n, que implica un tema
   de actualidad destacado y un tratamiento de este tema en el mundo real,
   ampl \& iacute;a sustancialmente el trabajo anterior. La exposici \&
   oacute;n a este tratamiento elev \& oacute; el apoyo de las \&
   eacute;lites con respecto a aumentar las sanciones del 68,0\% al 76,3\%
   (+8,3 pp.). Este efecto, si bien es significativo, es menor que los
   efectos que hab \& iacute;an sido identificados en otros casos.
   Argumentamos que esta diferencia se debe a la din \& aacute;mica del
   pretratamiento, que, a su vez, se relaciona con la prominencia del
   problema y con los efectos techo, y, en consecuencia, esta diferencia es
   a \& uacute;n m \& aacute;s notable. Proporcionamos pruebas de una
   heterogeneidad sustancial del efecto del tratamiento en funci \&
   oacute;n de la experiencia en la materia, del grado de participaci \&
   oacute;n en la toma de decisiones pol \& iacute;ticas y del g \&
   eacute;nero, pero no en funci \& oacute;n de la identificaci \& oacute;n
   partidista. Si bien nuestros resultados respaldan las investigaciones
   anteriores, tambi \& eacute;n ponen de relieve cuestiones de validez
   externa, as \& iacute; como la dependencia del contexto que tiene la
   capacidad de respuesta de las \& eacute;lites.
   L'opinion publique sur les affaires internationales a-t-elle un effet
   sur les pr \& eacute;f \& eacute;rences politiques des \& eacute;lites?
   La majorit \& eacute; des recherches suppose que tel est le cas, mais il
   est difficile de le v \& eacute;rifier empiriquement \& eacute;tant donn
   \& eacute; l'acc \& egrave;s limit \& eacute; de la recherche aux d \&

   Nous avons employ \& eacute; des sondages publics contemporains tr \&
   egrave;s en faveur d'une intensification des sanctions comme traitement
   de l'information. Notre conception de recherche, qui implique une
   question importante et un traitement du monde r \& eacute;el, prolonge

Title = {The trust deficit. EU bargaining for access and control over cloud
   infrastructures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 18},
Abstract = {European Union (EU) governments rely on a handful of American cloud
   providers (hyperscalers) for critical state functions, which creates
   strategic dependencies. The EU data sovereignty agenda aims to manage
   such dependence, yet hyperscalers criticise it for excluding leading
   industry players from the EU market and slowing economic growth. In this
   paper, we argue that sovereignty policies in the cloud are the result of
   a trust deficit between European governments and American hyperscalers.
   The trust deficit consists of a continuous bargain by European
   governments for greater access and control over hyperscalers'
   infrastructures. Hyperscalers, in turn, respond to such demands mainly
   through technology. But is their response sufficient to address the
   trust deficit? Drawing from technical documents and expert interviews,
   we find that states and hyperscalers have a fundamentally different
   understanding of sovereignty; that technology alone cannot address the
   trust deficit; and that data sovereignty policies in the cloud can be
   compatible with the digital economy and cybersecurity. Our study is a
   starting point for further research on the political economy of trust in
   the governance of digital technologies.},

Title = {Milícias in Rio de Janeiro: deconstructing the myth of a violent
   everyday peace through a feminist perspective},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Month = {DEC 11},
Abstract = {Mil \& iacute;cias have proliferated across Brazil, engaging in criminal
   activities while maintaining close connections to the Brazilian state
   and politicians. They seek political validation by presenting themselves
   as combating drug traffickers and reducing violence, positioning peace
   and security as fundamental to their political appeal. Therefore,
   examining the role of peace within these criminal organizations through
   the lens of peace and conflict studies provides valuable insights into
   how Brazilian militias work. Through an analysis of the rhetoric used by
   politicians, the media, and residents in areas under mil \& iacute;cias'
   control, it becomes apparent that these criminal groups assert their
   role in establishing a form of ``everyday peace.{''} However, this form
   of peace is inherently violent, resulting in a paradoxical concept of
   `violent everyday peace.' Consequently, the feminist framework's
   emphasis on the public/private distinction and the continuum of violence
   becomes crucial in addressing this paradox. By applying this feminist
   concept, it becomes evident that mil \& iacute;cias generate a limited
   sense of peace in the public sphere while perpetuating violence in the
   private domain. Private violence, however, is often overlooked by those
   unaffected by mil \& iacute;cia control, allowing these groups to garner
   political support. These findings enrich the study of criminal
   organizations in Brazil and the concept of everyday peace, which has not
   been previously explored in the context of Brazilian mil \& iacute;cias.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes cultural production in theaters across three
   pivotal historical moments from the 1980s to the present, including the
   theater as ruins, refuge, and resistance. It begins with the theater in
   ruins as depicted in the 1986 film, The Black Sheep, by the legendary
   playwright, director, and filmmaker, Rom \& aacute;n Chalbaud, in which
   a commune of artists, outcasts, and misfits squat in the theater, taking
   shelter from a storm of state-sponsored neoliberal austerity,
   corruption, and persecution in the pre-Ch \& aacute;vez era of
   Venezuela. The article then turns to the work of community groups during
   Ch \& aacute;vez-led revolutionary reforms to recuperate abandoned
   theaters as vital spaces for democratic assembly through municipal
   government programs. The last section of the article juxtaposes the
   advanced democratization of theaters and cultural production in Caracas
   during the Maduro era with a phase of violent street mobilizations in
   middle-class and wealthy sectors of the city (known as guarimbas), to
   raise questions about the role of the media as an intervening character
   in global theaters of illusion. Where the spotlight shifts in location
   from stages to streets, and the street to the screen, the actual
   conditions of democratized access are happening behind the unlit
   marquis, a global majority operating in an `underground' commune in the
   same scenario as the film. Except in this case, the military-media arm
   of the US polices the `streets' of the global media commons to malign
   the Bolivarian Revolution as a black sheep political project. The
   conclusion points to the media's role in promoting a dangerous
   misperception of reality by erasing the constituent power of a
   revolutionary society and the perpetuation of violence against them.},

Title = {Segregation and school composition in Washington, DC following the
   implementation of a unified school lottery},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 28},
Abstract = {The global expansion of choice programmes fuels debates about the equity
   potential of school choice policies and mechanisms. In 2014, Washington,
   D.C. pioneered a citywide lottery and enrolment system to match students
   with preferred institutions and distribute access to seats in
   high-demand schools. While unified lottery and enrolment systems impact
   a vast number of students and influence educational opportunities across
   continents, little evidence exists on the efficacy of these systems or
   the link between centralized lotteries and changes in school composition
   or segregation. Using longitudinal data and an interrupted time series
   analysis, this study examines the relationship between D.C.'s
   centralized lottery system and student distribution. We find unchanged
   desegregation trends systemwide and annual increases in segregation in
   schools located in wealthier and lower-income wards after the adoption
   of the lottery system. We raise questions about the way
   school-designated preference structures give the appearance of numerous
   school options for families, while keeping access to meaningful choices
   superficial. Across international contexts, these systems may aid
   desegregation efforts and enhance equity by randomizing school matches,
   preventing cream skimming, and offering a baseline of school
   information, but additional research is needed to better understand
   their substantive outcomes.},

Title = {Borders of belonging: how Chinese nationalism constructs exclusion in
   the age of populism},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {This paper investigates how state-led and popular nationalism in China
   construct borders as tools of exclusion, reinforcing national identity
   amidst global populist movements. Using the Belt and Road Initiative
   (BRI) as a case study, the analysis examines Global Times articles and
   corresponding user-generated content to reveal how geopolitical,
   ideological, and emotional borders are created and maintained through
   nationalist discourse. State-led nationalism emphasizes cooperation and
   diplomacy, framing borders to position China as a global leader
   promoting shared prosperity. In contrast, popular nationalism-expressed
   through user-generated comments-manifests in a confrontational,
   exclusionary discourse that delineates China from external adversaries,
   particularly Western powers. Through a mixed-methods approach-combining
   word frequency, sentiment, and emotional categorization using the NRC
   Emotion Lexicon-this study uncovers key differences between the two
   forms of nationalism. State narratives construct inclusive borders that
   foster international engagement, aligning with China's diplomatic
   ambitions. Meanwhile, popular nationalism reflects heightened emotional
   intensity, especially through expressions of fear, anger, and
   opposition, creating rigid borders that emphasize ideological conflict
   and national pride. The research contributes to the literature on
   populism and border studies by demonstrating how Chinese nationalism
   functions as both a state strategy and a grassroots expression,
   delineating ``the people{''} from ``the other.{''} It highlights the
   critical role of media-both state-controlled outlets and user-generated
   platforms-in constructing and reinforcing these boundaries. As populism
   continues to shape political discourse globally, the study offers
   valuable insights into how nationalism in non-Western contexts mirrors
   broader populist strategies of identity formation through the
   construction of symbolic and emotional borders.},

Abstract = {This study examines the integration of green construction in the
   development of Indonesia's new capital city, Ibu Kota Nusantara (IKN),
   by applying the Sustainable Triangle Concept within the framework of
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The research addresses critical
   issues such as environmental sustainability, economic viability, and
   social inclusivity in developing IKN. Employing a quantitative
   descriptive approach, the study collected data through a purposive
   sampling method from 100 stakeholders, including environmental experts,
   community members, and contractors involved in IKN projects. Structural
   Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis, performed with PLS software, revealed
   significant relationships between green construction and sustainable
   development, with the environmental, economic, and social aspects
   serving as mediating variables. Findings indicate that green
   construction practices positively impact sustainable development by
   fostering energy efficiency, utilizing sustainable materials, and
   enhancing community welfare. The study highlights that sustainable urban
   development in IKN can serve as a model for balancing economic growth
   with environmental preservation and social equity, supporting
   Indonesia's broader sustainability goals. This research contributes to
   theoretical and practical knowledge, offering a replicable model for
   policymakers and stakeholders seeking to implement sustainable practices
   in urban development. Future research is suggested to further explore
   the replicability of this model in other regions, addressing broader
   challenges and opportunities in sustainable urban planning.},

Abstract = {Does environmental displacement provoke political instability? Though
   migration has long been considered an intermediary in the causal path
   between environmental change and political upheaval, the relationship
   remains theoretically underdeveloped and evidence has been limited. This
   article examines the impact of displacement caused by sudden-onset
   natural hazards on disruptive antigovernment events including armed
   conflict, protests and violent riots. It leverages the new Environmental
   Displacement Dataset (EnDis), an original dataset that identifies
   quantities of human movement in response to six types of sudden-onset
   natural hazards in Africa from 1990 to 2017, including floods, storms,
   wildfires, landslides, earthquakes and volcanic activity. The results of
   the analyses show that while environmental displacement is not
   associated with civil war onset or protests, it does increase the
   incidence of attacks by armed non-state actors and violent riots.
   Importantly, these destabilizing effects occurr primarily (1) in the
   context of displacement driven by floods and storms, and (2) when levels
   of displacement are well above average. Collectively, these findings
   portend deepening security crises and violent political upheaval as
   climate change drives more frequent episodes of extreme weather and
   excessive environmental displacement.},

Title = {Interlocal learning mechanisms and policy diffusion: The case of new
   energy vehicles finance in Chinese cities},

Abstract = {Policy diffusion based on learning mechanisms has fascinated political
   science and public administration scholars for a long time. A robust and
   growing body of studies have identified the existence and importance of
   learning mechanisms in policy diffusion. However, there are still some
   gaps that need to be further improved. First, scholars identify the
   learning mechanism mainly based on indirect evidence, such as
   geographical proximity and successful innovation policies adopted by
   other jurisdictions, which lacking direct and systematic evidence.
   Second, little is known about how the hierarchical power structure
   affects the leap from learning behavior to policy adoption. This study
   provides direct evidence for the promoting effect of intergovernmental
   learning on policy diffusion by analyzing case of Chinese local
   financial subsidy policies for new energy vehicles. The empirical
   results reveal that policy learning in the form of site visits among
   local governments significantly promotes the policy diffusion, but
   superior government policy strategy attenuates the influence of
   interlocal learning on policy diffusion. Also, the initiators and themes
   of policy learning affect the learning-diffusion linkage, portraying the
   conditional effects and nuanced dynamics of interlocal policy learning
   in eliciting policy diffusion.

   La difusi \& oacute;n de pol \& iacute;ticas basada en mecanismos de
   aprendizaje ha fascinado a los acad \& eacute;micos de la ciencia pol \&
   iacute;tica y la administraci \& oacute;n p \& uacute;blica durante
   mucho tiempo. Un cuerpo s \& oacute;lido y creciente de estudios ha
   identificado la existencia e importancia de los mecanismos de
   aprendizaje en la difusi \& oacute;n de pol \& iacute;ticas. Sin
   embargo, todav \& iacute;a hay algunas brechas que necesitan ser
   mejoradas. En primer lugar, los acad \& eacute;micos identifican el
   mecanismo de aprendizaje principalmente bas \& aacute;ndose en evidencia
   indirecta, como la proximidad geogr \& aacute;fica y las pol \&
   iacute;ticas de innovaci \& oacute;n exitosas adoptadas por otras
   jurisdicciones, que carecen de evidencia directa y sistem \&
   aacute;tica. En segundo lugar, se sabe poco sobre c \& oacute;mo la
   estructura de poder jer \& aacute;rquica afecta el salto del
   comportamiento de aprendizaje a la adopci \& oacute;n de pol \&
   iacute;ticas. Este estudio proporciona evidencia directa del efecto
   promotor del aprendizaje intergubernamental en la difusi \& oacute;n de
   pol \& iacute;ticas al analizar el caso de las pol \& iacute;ticas de
   subsidio financiero local chinas para veh \& iacute;culos de nueva energ
   \& iacute;a. Los resultados emp \& iacute;ricos revelan que el
   aprendizaje de pol \& iacute;ticas en forma de visitas a sitios entre
   los gobiernos locales promueve significativamente la difusi \& oacute;n
   de pol \& iacute;ticas, pero la estrategia de pol \& iacute;tica
   gubernamental superior aten \& uacute;a la influencia del aprendizaje
   interlocal en la difusi \& oacute;n de pol \& iacute;ticas. Adem \&
   aacute;s, los iniciadores y los temas del aprendizaje de pol \&
   iacute;ticas afectan el v \& iacute;nculo aprendizaje-difusi \&
   oacute;n, retratando los efectos condicionales y la din \& aacute;mica
   matizada del aprendizaje de pol \& iacute;ticas interlocales en la
   obtenci \& oacute;n de la difusi \& oacute;n de pol \& iacute;ticas.},
