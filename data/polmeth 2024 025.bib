Abstract = {Europe's successful embrace of its geopolitical potential in a
   multipolar world will require both greater cohesion and an enhanced
   ability to act globally. Europe's three major powers - France, Germany
   and the United Kingdom - have managed to either stave off or recover
   from right-wing populism, and have dealt competently with the
   Russia-Ukraine war. But they are currently too riven by internal
   politics or historical prejudices to take the lead in Europe. Relief
   from domestic political dysfunction may therefore rest with the European
   Union itself. Under Ursula von der Leyen's authoritative leadership, the
   European Commission has become the most decisive and capable political
   actor in Europe. This was demonstrated by its imaginative response to
   the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and through its comprehensive Russian
   sanctions regime in 2022. However, only another crisis - such as a
   second Donald Trump presidential term - is likely to generate the
   momentum for the commission to re-emerge as the engine for further
   European integration.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that Egypt's balancing position on the war on Ukraine
   is shaped by a combination of a rational analysis of the consequences of
   the war and a pre-war vision of its role in the ongoing global
   transformation. The paper employs the framework of varied
   consequentialism to identify the main factors driving Egypt's balancing
   position. The first factor relates to Egypt's dependence on external
   partners, contributing to the vulnerability of its national security,
   which leaves minimal room for maneuvering in responding to external
   crises, including the war in Ukraine. The second factor relates to the
   negative implications of the war on Egypt's national food security. The
   third factor is the need for external support to contain the war's
   negative consequences, which raises questions about the reliability of
   the international partners. The paper also discusses how this balancing
   position has defined Egypt's response to the American and Russian
   visions of the new world order in the post-Ukraine war period.},

Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES},

Abstract = {The goal of this article is to analyze the effects of capitalist
   modernization on the fishing industry located in Brazil's far south from
   a perspective of socioenvironmental oceanography. Socioenvironmental
   oceanography builds on the contributions of historical materialism that
   prioritizes the study of the material foundations that support the
   process of capitalist accumulation. Within this perspective, the object
   of analysis shifts to one that is centered around the production of
   (ethno)oceanographic spaces. We argue that the production of these
   spaces result in the creation of public policies, which are geared
   towards mobilizing material and non-material resources for an epistemic
   community. This community was promoted to being a center of calculation
   whose supposed goal was to find ways to improve the bioeconomic
   ``sustainability{''} of fishery resources. This process destroys fishing
   resources, as well as traditional/artisanal fishing systems and
   territories. In addition, it sets the stage for material and
   non-material precedents based around the spatial planning of marine
   areas that goes back to the foundations of the blue economy.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the role of citizen political affinities in
   shaping attitudes towards judicial decisions in corruption cases
   involving politicians. Although emerging research suggests that
   decisions regarding a high-ranking politician can reduce general citizen
   trust in courts, there is no systematic evidence examining how political
   affinities differentially affect confidence in court decisions depending
   on the accused politician. We conducted a survey experiment during a
   2022 presidential election rally in Brazil at a time of heightened
   affective polarization and corruption. We presented respondents with
   vignettes detailing a fictional corruption scheme and trial outcomes
   (acquittal or conviction) involving key political figures, including
   Presidents Luiz In \& aacute;cio Lula da Silva and Jair Bolsonaro. The
   results indicate that when a court decision is consistent with citizens'
   electoral preferences, they are more inclined to trust the court
   decision and vice versa.},

Abstract = {Punitive measures (sanctions) are central to accountability. Their use
   is however costly as they harm relationships. Prior research shows that
   punitive measures often remain unused. Public sector actors further
   operate in informal accountability settings where punitive measures are
   absent. Additionally, doctrines such as New Public Governance prioritize
   informal networks above hierarchy and punitive measures. Against this
   background, we study when and why nonpunitive accountability can be
   effective. Three theoretical logics are developed for decision-making
   behavior under the condition of accountability. We theorize
   account-givers are driven by a combination of extrinsic, intrinsic, and
   relational motivation. A conjoint experiment is used to study decisions
   (N = 761) of administrative leaders in Denmark in varying nonpunitive
   accountability conditions. Our findings suggest that a combination of
   extrinsic motivation and relational motivation explains decisions of
   account-givers in nonpunitive settings. The study expands our
   theoretical knowledge of the behavioral effects of accountability and
   offers insights for policy practitioners.},

Abstract = {The extent to which rules in a governing arrangement addresses its local
   conditions is usually defined in the environmental governance literature
   as the problem of fit. Actors in governing arrangements with
   decision-making authority are capable of choosing and designing specific
   policy tools in order to address specific policy problems. In this
   manuscript, we combine insights from the literature on policy design and
   the literature on common-pool resource governance to assess the extent
   to which Nebraska's Natural Resources Districts (NRDs), which were
   created to provide context-specific solutions to local water problems,
   design plans, and programs that fit their social-ecological contexts.
   Using semi-automated text analysis approaches and Qualitative
   Comparative Analysis, we assess how the design of plans and programs
   created by NRDs vary, to fit their social-ecological contexts. Results
   indicate that the biophysical context plays a role in shaping the
   content of plans and programs, but that broader top-down institutional
   mandates may play an even stronger role in shaping the outputs produced
   by NRDs.},

Abstract = {This Special Issue (SI) examines the revival of Street-Level Bureaucracy
   (SLB) in the context of contemporary public policy implementation. The
   introduction includes a literature review highlighting SLB's enduring
   relevance and its applications in various sectors. It also presents the
   four emperical articles of the SI covering regional migration policies
   in Argentina and Brazil, asylum judges in Italy and France, gambling
   harm reduction in Piedmont, and the implementation of the Minimum Income
   Scheme in Veneto. These studies underscore the importance of four
   crucial dimensions: the Critical Role of SLBs in Policy Outcomes, the
   Need for Support and Resources, the Influence of External and Internal
   Pressures, and the Importance of Understanding SLB Experiences for
   Policy Design.},

Abstract = {As a post-colonial nation that embraces international law and
   multilateralism, Brazil was expected to side with those who defend the
   sanctity of Ukraine's territorial integrity when the country was invaded
   by Russia. However, as a Global Southern country with tangible
   geopolitical and economic interests at stake in the war, Brazil turned a
   blind eye to Russia's defiant move and downplayed the gravity of its
   breach of the law. This article aims to explore the contradictions in
   Brazil's foreign policy stance towards the Russo-Ukrainian war. It
   analyes the difficult balance between ideals and concrete goals that
   Brazilian diplomats strive to achieve in the ongoing war. In doing so,
   it also sheds light on the current administration's strategies to cope
   with today's emerging multipolar order and to avoid falling prey to the
   ``weaponization of interdependence{''}. The article concludes reflecting
   on Brazil's quest for an actively non-aligned position to address the
   sovereignty paradox it faces in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Academic literature widely assumes that extremist-housing online forums,
   like 4chan, uniformly celebrate acts of right-wing terrorism (e.g. via
   ``sainthood memes{''}), such as those committed by Anders Breivik and
   Brenton Tarrant. Aside from a handful of exceptions, this body of
   research typically fails to acknowledge that ideologically likeminded
   individuals on 4chan also regularly debate the merits of both terrorists
   and their violent attacks. Our topic modeling of 100 thousand posts on
   4chan's infamous /pol/ board shows-heated-debates over Breivik and
   Tarrant ranging from celebratory, to condemning, and moral to
   conspiratorial. We argue that overlooking these debates limits valuable
   theoretical and practical insights.},

Abstract = {When the Legislative Council of the Australian island state of Tasmania
   rejected gay law reform in July 1991, a group of enterprising activists
   took their case to the United Nations. In April 1994, the United Nations
   Human Rights Committee ruled in their favor. The case, Toonen v
   Australia, , is a landmark human rights judgement that has proved highly
   influential in the years that have followed. Using interviews with the
   principal participants, this article provides a historical narrative of

Abstract = {This paper demonstrates an automated workflow for extracting network
   data from policy documents. We use natural language processing tools,
   part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic dependency parsing, to represent
   relationships between real-world entities based on how they are
   described in text. Using a corpus of regional groundwater management
   plans, we demonstrate unique graph motifs created through parsing
   syntactic relationships and how document-level syntax can be aggregated
   to develop large-scale graphs. This approach complements and extends
   existing methods in public management and governance research by (1)
   expanding the feasible geographic and temporal scope of data collection
   and (2) allowing for customized representations of governance systems to
   fit different research applications, particularly by creating graphs
   with many different node and edge types. We conclude by reflecting on
   the challenges, limitations, and future directions of automated,
   text-based methods for governance research.},

Title = {A Bargaining Theory of Criminal War},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {68},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 29},
Abstract = {Criminal war is a leading cause of death around the world. We argue for
   the inclusion of this topic in security studies and adapt a bargaining
   framework to shed light on why criminal groups fight or agree to peace.
   We propose that shocks to relative coercive capacity cause criminal war.
   This escalation in violent conflict proves more likely when criminal
   groups face greater difficulty negotiating: when they are more
   factionalized, less rooted in their territory, and in strategic rivalry
   with a greater number of rivals. Our empirical strategy leverages a
   critical, policy-relevant shock to access to weapons following an arms
   control repeal, and novel city block-level, monthly data on criminal
   organization traits, turf, and violence over ten years to understand how
   changes in coercive inputs upset the existing balance of power among
   criminal groups and shaped patterns of war and truce.
   La guerra criminal es una de las principales causas de muerte en todo el
   mundo. Abogamos por la inclusi \& oacute;n de este tema dentro de los
   estudios de seguridad y adaptamos un marco de negociaci \& oacute;n que
   permita arrojar luz sobre por qu \& eacute; los grupos criminales luchan
   o llegan a acuerdos para la paz. Proponemos que los shocks que se
   producen con relaci \& oacute;n a la capacidad coercitiva relativa son
   los que causan una guerra criminal. Esta escalada en el conflicto
   violento resulta m \& aacute;s probable cuando los grupos criminales se
   enfrentan a mayores dificultades para negociar, es decir, cuando est \&
   aacute;n m \& aacute;s fraccionados, menos arraigados en su territorio o
   en rivalidad estrat \& eacute;gica con un mayor n \& uacute;mero de
   rivales. Nuestra estrategia emp \& iacute;rica aprovecha un shock cr \&
   iacute;tico y relevante para la formulaci \& oacute;n de pol \&
   iacute;ticas como es el acceso a las armas, tras la derogaci \& oacute;n
   del control de armas, as \& iacute; como nuevos datos mensuales a nivel
   de manzanas de la ciudad sobre los rasgos, el territorio y la violencia
   de las organizaciones criminales a lo largo de diez a \& ntilde;os con
   el fin de comprender c \& oacute;mo los cambios en los insumos
   coercitivos alteran el equilibrio de poder existente entre los grupos
   criminales y dan forma a los patrones en materia de guerra y de treguas.
   La guerre criminelle est une des principales causes de d \& eacute;c \&
   egrave;s dans le monde. Nous soutenons son inclusion dans les \&
   eacute;tudes internationales et adaptons un cadre de n \&
   eacute;gociation pour mettre en lumi \& egrave;re les raisons qui
   poussent les groupes criminels \& agrave; se battre ou \& agrave;
   accepter la paix. Nous proposons que les chocs de la capacit \& eacute;
   de coercition relative entra \& icirc;nent des guerres criminelles.
   Cette escalade en conflit violent s'av \& egrave;re d'autant plus
   probable quand les groupes criminels se trouvent davantage en difficult
   \& eacute; dans les n \& eacute;gociations: si les factions sont
   nombreuses en leur sein, si leur ancrage territorial est plus faible, et
   s'ils rivalisent avec un plus grand nombre de groupes sur le plan strat
   \& eacute;gique. Notre strat \& eacute;gie empirique exploite un choc
   critique et pertinent - l'acc \& egrave;s aux armes, apr \& egrave;s une
   abrogation du contr \& ocirc;le des armements - et sur de nouvelles donn
   \& eacute;es mensuelles au niveau des p \& acirc;t \& eacute;s de

   criminelles, leur territoire et leur violence sur dix ans. L'objectif
   est de comprendre comment les changements dans ces apports coercitifs
   bouleversent l'\& eacute;quilibre des pouvoirs existant entre les
   groupes criminels et fa \& ccedil;onnent les mod \& egrave;les de guerre

Title = {Unpacking Legitimacy Perceptions of Investment Dispute Settlement:
   Effects of Outcome and Procedure},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {68},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 29},
Abstract = {How do citizens perceive different avenues for resolving investor-state
   disputes in case of an unfavorable decision? In this article, I argue
   that the interplay between procedure- and outcome-related considerations
   influences citizens' legitimacy beliefs toward investor-state dispute
   settlement (ISDS) systems. First, an unfavorable ISDS ruling should
   decrease public legitimacy beliefs in the country that got sued. Second,
   the type of dispute settlement mechanism should influence legitimacy
   beliefs, leading to different assessments of the legal proceedings. I
   fielded a survey experiment in France, Germany, and the United States to
   test these theoretical expectations. The findings confirm that an
   unfavorable ISDS ruling has a strong negative effect on public
   perceptions of the legal proceeding, but further show that appropriate
   design choices can boost public legitimacy beliefs. These results have
   important implications for the debate about ISDS reform and the
   scholarship on legitimacy in global governance. The impact of
   unfavorable decisions on public legitimacy beliefs has been widely
   overlooked.
   \& iquest;C \& oacute;mo perciben los ciudadanos las diferentes v \&
   iacute;as que existen para resolver las disputas entre inversionistas y
   el Estado en caso de una decisi \& oacute;n desfavorable? En este art \&
   iacute;culo, argumentamos que la interacci \& oacute;n que existe entre
   el procedimiento y las consideraciones relacionadas con los resultados
   influye sobre las creencias de los ciudadanos con relaci \& oacute;n a
   la legitimidad de los sistemas de abitraje de diferencias
   Estado-inversor (ISDS, por sus siglas en ingl \& eacute;s). En primer
   lugar, un fallo desfavorable de un ISDS deber \& iacute;a disminuir las
   creencias en materia de legitimidad p \& uacute;blica en el pa \&
   iacute;s de- mandado. En segundo lugar, el tipo de mecanismo de soluci
   \& oacute;n de controversias deber \& iacute;a influir sobre las
   creencias en materia de legitimidad, lo que provocar \& iacute;a
   diferentes evaluaciones de los procedimientos legales. Llevamos a cabo
   un experimento de encuesta en Francia, Alemania y Estados Unidos con el
   fin de poner a prueba estas expectativas te \& oacute;ricas. Nuestras
   conclusiones confirman que un fallo desfavorable por parte de un ISDS
   tiene un fuerte efecto negativo sobre las percepciones p \&
   uacute;blicas del procedimiento legal, pero, adem \& aacute;s,
   demuestran que unas opciones de dise \& ntilde;o apropiadas pueden
   aumentar las creencias en materia de legitimidad p \& uacute;blica.
   Estos resultados tienen implicaciones importantes para el debate sobre
   la reforma del sistema de ISDS y para los estudios acad \& eacute;micos
   sobre la legitimidad en la gobernanza global. El impacto que ejercen las
   decisiones desfavorables sobre las creencias en materia de legitimidad p
   \& uacute;blica ha sido, mayoritariamente, pasado por alto.

Abstract = {This article explores the meaning and importance of hate in intergroup
   conflict, especially in conflict that moves to genocide or politicide.
   Review of controversies in defining hate leads to definition of hate as
   an extreme form of negative identification that includes perception of
   bad essence. Negative identification is inverse caring for others, as
   seen in studies of schadenfreude and gluckschmerz. Studies of
   dehumanization suggest that two forms of bad essence can be
   distinguished: evil human (entitativity essentializing) and infrahuman
   animal (natural kind essentializing). Studies also show that those who
   essentialize more are more ready to punish indiscriminately all members
   of a rival group-thus essentializing facilitates killing by category.
   Application of the negative-identification-bad-essence definition of
   hate in the Nazi, Cambodian, and Rwandan cases indicates that leaders of
   political mass murder hate their victims, but that hate is relatively
   unimportant for those who do the killing. For the mass public that
   leaders and perpetrators claim to represent, the importance of hate as
   defined here is currently unknown. Implications are considered for
   measuring hate in texts and polls and for future directions of research
   on hate.},

Abstract = {This study delves into the criteria under which referendums can
   legitimise political choices. It employs survey experiments regarding EU
   membership across seven European nations, focusing on variations in
   referendum outcomes, majority margins and voter participation. The
   empirical results reveal a consistent pattern of legitimacy attributed
   to referendums, emphasising the influence of majority margin and voter
   turnout. It also uncovers the critical role of status quo bias on
   outcome favorability and the apprehension regarding false majorities in
   shaping public acceptance of referendums. This research contributes to
   understanding the mechanisms by which democratic procedures legitimise
   political decisions, revealing the nuanced role of referendums in
   democratic governance.},

Abstract = {Research on men, masculinities, and of men's violences has multiplied
   recently, as have violence-prevention initiatives, especially in
   conflict-affected societies. Drawing on my experiences of working on
   violence prevention as well as of conducting research with men in
   violence-prone groups in post-conflict Timor-Leste, I reflect on the
   practical and conceptual challenges of this work. Key concepts from
   Critical Studies of Men and Masculinities (CSMM) were helpful in part
   but were challenged by the lived realities and narratives of the men I
   interviewed. Common conflations of violence and hegemonic masculinity
   proved less-than straightforward. Perhaps inevitably, this work carried
   with it an element of epistemic violence, of outside concepts being
   imposed by a privileged me upon my research subjects through my
   interpretation of their lives. Given how central engaging with `violent
   masculinities' should be to gender-transformative peacebuilding, these
   challenges speak to broader questions of the possibilities of social
   change and ethical questions involved.},

Title = {Imagining the flood: rationalities of governance in sinking cities},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 24},
Abstract = {The rise in global sea levels poses a substantial, sometimes existential
   threat to coastal cities around the world, such as Bangkok, Lagos, or
   Jakarta. Adaptation projects range from hard infrastructure to
   nature-based solutions or `planned retreat', often having severe
   implications in terms of equity and equality. Given the threat of urban
   flooding and submergence, this paper asks how `the future' for these
   cities is imagined, and how sociotechnical imaginaries of climate
   futures inform policymaking. Using insights from poststructuralism and
   Science and Technology Studies (STS), I argue that the way of `seeing'
   and `knowing' sea level rise is constitutive of the rationalities that
   undergird the governing of rising water around the world. I trace the
   discrete operations of the discursive formations and imaginaries that
   have evolved globally around the issue of sea level rise, with their own
   distinctive logics. Analyzing a variety of globally circulating policy
   documents and local adaptation projects, I show how the governance of
   sea level rise is based on a very specific `expert' knowledge that
   allows re-designing sinking cities `from above'. This kind of knowledge,
   provided by a depoliticizing global network of consultants, designers,
   and development banks, privileges imaginaries of modernity and control
   using technology and engineering, as well as ideas on how populations in
   flood-prone areas are expected to govern themselves in the advent of
   rising sea levels. These imaginaries tend to marginalize alternative
   local adaptation practices, lead to unintended outcomes, and often
   discriminate against those who are already vulnerable to climate change
   impacts.},

Abstract = {This article applies the international cooperation concept of issue
   linkage to identify an overlooked pathway to successful security
   assistance. We argue that providers can effectively incentivise
   recipients to implement otherwise undesirable reforms when they
   explicitly link implementation to another good whose value to the
   recipient outweighs the costs of the reforms. Drawing on original
   interviews, we find support for our argument in post-Dayton Bosnia and
   Herzegovina (BiH), where the United States used the promise of NATO's
   Partnership for Peace program to incentivise BiH to integrate its three
   armies.},

Abstract = {Scholars often associate the political instrumentalisation of memory
   with right-wing populists. But this focus somewhat obscures the fact
   that elected officials across the political spectrum instrumentalise
   memory in their efforts to shape perceptions and influence behaviours.
   In fact, the success of memory laws often depends on the fact that MPs
   from diverse political parties support the same projects not only to
   validate their own views but also to delegitimise those of others. I
   refer to the conflicts resulting from different political actors'
   support of the same memory laws as embedded memory wars. Based on
   documentary analysis and fieldwork interviews, this article examines
   embedded memory wars through the illustrative case of the 2019
   recognition of the Armenian Genocide in Italy's Chamber of Deputies. In
   supporting Armenian Genocide recognition, Italian MPs from both right
   and left-wing parties developed competing narratives to debate
   contemporary topics related to European integration, multiculturalism,
   and Turkey.},

Title = {Brazilian failures to consolidate a domestic nuclear industry: the role
   of science and technology policies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 8},
Abstract = {This article proposes an alternative domestic-level explanation as to
   why has Brazil not developed a robust nuclear industry like India if
   both countries departed from similar diplomatic positions. The existing
   literature focuses mainly on diplomatic or geopolitical topics to
   address this puzzle. This research endeavor undertakes an inquiry into
   the intricacies of the matter through the application of Hymans'
   hypothesis, which delves into the contextual milieu within which
   scientists operate. This entails an exploration of how policymakers lend
   their support to scientific and technological mechanisms, thereby
   steering them toward the realization of their envisioned objectives.
   Employing a qualitative research paradigm, the findings of this study
   pivot upon insights gleaned from semi-structured interviews and primary
   source materials. The present scholarly article conducts an in-depth
   examination centered on the realm of Brazilian nuclear policy, with
   India serving as an illustrative shadow case. Notably, India is
   emblematic of a nation wherein scientists have aptly navigated the
   requisite conditions to propel the advancement of the nuclear industry.
   The discourse contends that the diminished influence of scientists in
   the policymaking continuum, coupled with the dearth of investments in
   science, technology, and innovation, stand as pivotal considerations for
   comprehending the setbacks witnessed within Brazil's pursuit of nuclear
   autonomy.},

Abstract = {Voluntary Sustainability Standards (VSS) are transnational governance
   instruments that can be leveraged to pursue sustainable development in
   global value chains. They have proliferated since the 1990s in terms of
   their number and the share of global production they govern. This paper
   shares some key insights arising from the considerable body of
   literature that has analysed the role of these instruments for
   sustainable production and trade. First, it introduces VSS, traces the
   evolution of their adoption and takes stock of the research on their
   sustainability impacts. Next, some major developments in the VSS realm
   are discussed, related to public policy and the emergence of national
   sustainability standards. The paper then zooms in on the challenges and
   limitations of VSS in transforming value chains towards sustainability,
   focusing on the shortcomings related to inclusiveness and the problems
   arising from their proliferation. The paper concludes by distilling
   recommendations on overcoming these challenges, especially in light of
   recent policy developments, and outlines what different stakeholders can
   do to make VSS more effective and inclusive instruments for sustainable
   value chains.},

Abstract = {This paper brings insights into ideational robustness to bear on the
   International Monetary Fund (IMF) fiscal policy thinking. It advances
   understanding of both the IMF and the concept of ideational robustness
   by focusing on economic ideas as they are put into practice by expert
   economic institutions. The IMF has traditionally enjoyed a reputation as
   a hawkish enforcer of neoliberal doctrine and conservative fiscal
   discipline, foregrounding deficit bias and fiscal sustainability
   concerns. Capitalist crises, notably the 2008 crash and COVID, have seen
   public debt increase while rendering growth and stability increasingly
   elusive. This turbulence has spurred some rethinking of Fund fiscal
   ideas. The IMF has added the new concept of fiscal space to its policy
   commentary and advocacy. Fiscal space seeks to reconcile economic
   stabilization and supporting growth to the Fund's overarching concern to
   maintain fiscal discipline and sustainability. A focus on how ideas are
   put into practice shows that long-standing Fund fiscal priorities are
   hardwired into operational frameworks, curtailing the new emphasis and
   adaptions. Thus, key to the institutional conditions of IMF fiscal
   policy actions are ``baked in{''} economic ideas. These are
   operationalized through economic models, analytical tools, fiscal
   evaluation frameworks, and standard operating procedures. The ``politics
   of economic method,{''} in the form of deliberation and contestation
   over different normative ideas that can underpin alternative
   constructions of such policy frameworks, plays an important role in
   shaping which economic ideas come to matter, and how, for the IMF. The
   Fund's ``fiscal space{''} episode can be interpreted as a quest for
   ideational robustness (through increased flexibility), which thus far
   remains unrealized due to the crucial role of these mechanisms,
   institutional conditions, and ideational path dependencies.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to explain why spatial policy in England has been so
   ineffective in recent decades. It offers a novel framework -
   `Hyper-Active Incrementalism' - to conceptualise the way that public
   policy in this area is prone to being short-term, under-evaluated,
   reactive, fragmented, incremental and top-down. It applies this
   framework to a historical survey of spatial policy, offering a nuanced
   understanding of the causes of these pathologies. We argue that
   Hyper-Active Incrementalism helps explain the persistence of a range of
   Westminster pathologies, as it drives the ongoing dialectic relationship
   between over-centralisation and policy failure. The data drawn from our
   historical survey suggest that Hyper-Active Incrementalism has
   accelerated overtime, a dynamic of increasing governance fragmentation
   that contributes to the incoherence of the UK state. In conclusion, we
   argue that governments must learn from past failure not just in this
   policy area but also elsewhere, by adopting a system-wide approach to
   reform.},

Abstract = {Moralized minority actors can play important roles in social change
   processes by rejecting majority social norms and modeling alternative
   societal pathways. However, being a minority actor can be difficult,
   often resulting in stigma, derogation, and hostility from the majority
   group. For actions intrinsically linked with daily life (e.g., eating),
   such social obstacles might become so great that individuals acting
   alone experience activist burnout' and social isolation, and may stop
   pursuing social change altogether. Event-based interventions are a
   promising (yet currently understudied) avenue for ameliorating these
   negative consequences and maintaining minority-driven social change.
   Through on-site field interviews (N = 20), we explore how attending an
   identity-centering mass gathering ({''}The Vegan Campout{''}) acts to
   validate and empower a minority group (vegans) seeking social change. We
   show how the event functioned as a space where vegan identity, food, and
   action were centered and celebrated, in stark contrast to vegans'
   experiences of a majority meat-eating society, where they often
   experienced negativity. Experiencing a `temporary social majority'
   context provided important respite for vegans to gain strength, rekindle
   their vegan identities, and (re)affirm their commitment to activism. Our
   findings provide insight into the benefits of identity-centering events
   for sustaining social change efforts among moralized minority groups.},

Abstract = {The marketplace of ideas is a colourful metaphor with a long history of
   being used to argue for freedom of speech. This paper draws on its
   historical antecedents to begin with an orthodox understanding of the
   metaphor whereby the absence of substantive regulation is taken to be
   conducive to the good functioning of both economic markets and public
   discourse. This anti-regulation reading is then challenged by analysing
   a series of legal cases showcasing prohibitions on misrepresentation and
   fraud. These speech regulations are explained by the economics
   literature on information asymmetry, which illustrates how honesty
   regulations maintain good market functioning by facilitating credible
   reliance by market participants on one another's assertions. What is
   thereby proposed is a re-imagining of the marketplace of ideas metaphor
   which lends support to honesty regulations in the realm of public
   speech. One potential analogue for these legal and economic findings is
   identified in the work of Shiffrin and her arguments for deontological
   sincerity requirements in the public sphere.},

Abstract = {How does conflict, displacement, and return shape trust, reconciliation,
   and community engagement? And what is the relative impact of exposure to
   violence on these indicators? In this paper we explore these questions
   by focusing on the legacies of armed conflict and the differences
   between those who stayed in their communities of origin during the
   conflict (stayees) and those who were displaced internally and
   internationally and who returned home over time (returnees). The
   results, which rely on analysis of data we collected in Burundi, suggest
   that internal returnees have significantly lower levels of trust,
   reconciliation, and community engagement than stayees, whereas the
   differences between international returnees and stayees are mostly
   statistically insignificant. Greater exposure to violence has a more
   negative effect on reconciliation and community engagement for returnees
   compared to stayees, while the effects on trust are mixed.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the 2015 Migration Crisis, the European Union has
   embarked on an extensive process to reinforce external border controls
   and make horizontal cooperation between EU agencies critical. This
   article leverages the principal-agent model to elucidate the impact of
   inter-agency cooperation on agency autonomy and, by extension, the
   management of the EU's external borders. The findings reveal that
   inter-agency cooperation leads to a situation in which the participating
   agencies enjoy more room for manoeuvre than originally granted by the EU
   legislature. This research sheds light on the proactive efforts of the
   concerned agencies in working alongside their counterparts to bolster
   their institutional standing and policy turf, thereby fuelling the
   institutionalisation of joint implementation in EU border management.},

   bioweapons do so to accomplish one of four general strategic objectives:
   mobilization, intimidation, attrition, or annihilation. With respect to
   mobilization and intimidation, bioweapons are a relatively poor
   substitute for conventional weapons-they are more difficult to acquire
   and deploy and their use is likely to cause a significant public
   backlash against perpetrators. Extremists pursuing the more maximalist
   goals of attrition and annihilation, however, have greater incentives to
   incorporate bioweapons into their arsenals, especially as the technical
   barriers to developing bioweapons decline.},

Abstract = {The transnational nature of cyberspace alters the role of third-party
   countries (TPCs) in international conflict. In the conventional
   environment, military operations are primarily confined to the
   boundaries of the combatants or a designated war zone. However, during
   cyber conflicts, operations may occur on the digital infrastructure of
   states not otherwise involved in the dispute. Nevertheless, within the
   cyber conflict literature, little is said about TPCs who, by virtue of
   interconnectivity, may find themselves involved in a conflict not of
   their own making. Consequently, we examine the political and diplomatic
   hazards of cyber operations involving these actors. Through survey
   experiments involving participants from the United Kingdom and Canada,
   we assess the public opinion impact of an offensive cyber operation's
   revelation on a TPC population. We find that while these incidents are
   viewed negatively, prior authorization and the involvement of an ally
   reduces this tendency. Such conditions lead the public to perceive these
   operations as corresponding with their national interest while
   suppressing fears of the possible consequences following their indirect
   involvement.},

Abstract = {A significant challenge faced by refugees, scholars and advocates is the
   achievement of policy change toward a humanitarian approach for
   asylum-seekers. This article examines the interconnectedness between
   academia and policy. Firstly, it provides a context for this advocacy.
   Secondly, it examines how and why academics seek to influence policy and
   how scholars assess their effectiveness. Thirdly, it interrogates how
   academics could be more effective while working alongside refugees and
   other advocates. In so doing, it presents Australia as a case study from
   which lessons can be learnt. It considers how scholars might engage with
   policymakers. It considers how scholars might engage with policymakers
   and provides considerations on the past and future of academic advocacy.},

Abstract = {Submissions on enforcement matters (SEMs) allow civil society members to
   assert that one party to a free trade agreement (FTA) is failing to
   enforce its domestic environmental laws. Submissions that survive every
   step of the SEM process result in a `factual record' prepared by a
   secretariat on enforcement matters. Relying on qualitative comparative
   analysis and an original dataset compiling the 158 SEMs submitted under
   the framework of US FTAs, I investigate what conditions make submissions
   more likely to succeed in leading to a factual record. I find that the
   existence of previous submissions dealing with the same facts,
   submissions against developing countries, and the presence of at least
   one non-governmental organization as a submitter contribute to a
   submission's success, but only in conjunction with other conditions and
   for a limited number of cases. This result provides overall evidence
   that secretariats' decisions are unbiased by the factors examined in
   this paper.},

Abstract = {When, and for whom, does it pay to make high-quality products? This
   article models how quality competition incentivizes producers to make
   products of particular qualities. Quality is defined as an abstract
   property of products that explains relative markups on prices that
   buyers will pay for otherwise comparable goods. Relative differences in
   quality sustain interlinked quality niches whose appeal to producers
   vary. The ordering of niches by quality and its implications for
   profitability establish the market's quality order of production. The
   model yields testable predictions for the locus of quality-related
   innovations. An analysis of the bottle closures used on 52 880 German
   wines by 1028 winemakers in three winemaking regimes supports the
   general claim that, and a specific claim as to how, quality competition
   incentivizes producers to pursue different quality-related strategies.
   The presented model situates quality competition and the socially
   embedded quality order of production at the heart of a socio-economic
   account of markets.},

Abstract = {Political protest and citizen participation are important drivers of
   democratic change. While previous research has identified both
   micro-level attitudes such as emancipative values and macro-level
   factors as drivers of protest behavior, we know little about how
   citizens' value-driven motivations interact with the political context.
   We argue that the effect of emancipative values on protest participation
   depends on both democratic institutions and the capacity of civil
   society mobilizations. Specifically, we expect the positive effect of
   emancipative values to be stronger in countries with higher democratic
   quality and more pro-democratic mass mobilizations, and weaker in
   countries with more pro-autocratic mass mobilizations. By combining
   survey and macro data for 88 democratic and autocratic regimes, we find
   that citizens' value orientations interact with democratic quality and
   the prevalence of pro-autocratic mass mobilizations in shaping protest
   participation. These results contribute to a better understanding of the
   structural and societal preconditions for democratic change.},

Abstract = {Women are more undecided than men about their vote choice, with around
   20\%-30\% of female respondents giving a `don't know' response to vote
   intention survey questions in Britain. In this article, we employ a
   mixed methods research design to explore why women are more likely to be
   undecided about their vote choice than men. Using survey data, we find
   that the gender gap in `don't know' responses is associated with gender
   gaps in political engagement and perceptions of policy representation.
   In focus groups, we find differences between men and women in how they
   want to be represented, and gender differences in
   conflict-avoidance/conflict-seeking, both of which we expect to
   contribute to gender differences in making a vote choice in-between
   elections. Our findings contribute to our understanding of how men and
   women engage with politics in Britain, as well as having implications
   for interpreting gender differences in vote intention in surveys.},

Abstract = {How do punitive attitudes toward politically motivated offenders in the
   United States vary by the offender's ideology? To address this, we
   conducted a survey experiment with U.S. adults (N = 1,100) in March
   2023. Participants were randomly assigned to either the January 6th or
   Portland 2020 condition and indicated their punitive attitudes for three
   politically motivated offenses. Across ideologies, punitiveness toward
   politically motivated offenders increased with offense severity.
   Although some correlates of punitiveness toward typical offenders held
   for politically motivated offenders, most did not. Further,
   relationships varied as a function of offense type and offender
   ideology.},

Title = {Simultaneous and Open Primaries in Latin America. A Preliminary Proposal
   for a Comparative Study},
Journal = {COLOMBIA INTERNACIONAL},

Abstract = {Objective/context: This article presents a comparative analysis of the
   system of simultaneous and open presidential primaries (PAS, for its
   acronym in Spanish) in Latin American countries that have adopted
   legislation on the subject. In what appears to be a growing trend, nine
   countries-with differences among them-have established a PAS regime
   regulated by the electoral body and with public financing. Methodology:
   First, a description is presented to characterize and classify different
   PAS systems, considering their main normative differences. Then,
   hypotheses about their possible effects are proposed based on the
   literature on presidential primaries and electoral systems. Finally,
   taking into account the results of the primaries carried out and the
   subsequent presidential elections, an attempt is made to show to what
   extent the PAS system encourages citizen participation and competition
   for nomination, whether it favors or harms the parties that carry them
   out, and its capacity to stabilize the party system. Conclusions:
   Factors that stimulate participation, such as compulsory voting and
   simultaneity with other elections, and encourage competition, such as
   open presidential ticket, are identified. No institutional factors are
   found to directly benefit or harm the groups that decide the candidacy
   in a primary, although conflicting primaries seem to harm them. The
   ability of the PAS system to stabilize party systems seems to depend on
   its interaction with other institutional and political factors.
   Originality: This is the first work that ventures into a comparative
   analysis of the PAS system with regional coverage.},

Title = {Ideational robustness of economic ideas in action: the case of European
   Union economic governance through a decade of crisis},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 27},
Abstract = {Is it possible to develop a robust crisis management response in a
   system where governance is characterized by coercive power and
   adversarial bargaining rather than the diversity, inclusion, and
   openness highlighted by extant scholarship as conducive factors for
   robustness? Using two instances of crisis in the European Union-the
   Eurozone crisis (2010-2015) and COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022)-the paper
   argues that how actors reinterpret existing rules and institutions
   offers an important source of robustness in crisis management. Based on
   the employment of a disaggregation of robustness into degrees of
   robustness, as well as the concepts of ideational and institutional
   power, we show how actors can counter the coercive power of dominant
   coalitions and open up for rule adaptation through reinterpretations of
   existing rules that, at least in the short term, can solidify the
   functioning of existing institutions faced by turbulence. In the context
   of the Eurozone crisis, ideational and institutional power thus enabled
   a moderately robust response without treaty reform. In the case of the
   pandemic, it was possible to convince (particularly German) policymakers
   of the need to employ new ideas about common debt. This meant less need
   to employ ideational and institutional power by other actors, leading to
   significantly more effective crisis management than in the Eurozone
   crisis, what the paper terms maximal robustness.},

Abstract = {Identifying a clear relationship between rebel group structures and the
   use of violence faces the challenge that group structures rarely change
   over time. We exploit the analytical advantage provided by long
   religious holidays to address this issue using the principal-agent
   framework. Religious holidays serve as a focal point and reduce group
   coordination costs, but also raise the societal costs of violence. We
   argue the principal of rebel groups is more sensitive to the increased
   societal costs than the agents and thereby attempts to restrain the
   agents from attacking during religious holidays. However, the success of
   these attempts depends on the group's institutionalization level. Long
   religious holidays exacerbate the principal-agent problem due to the
   high costs of restraining agents from attacking for an extended period,
   making them the most likely case for our analysis. We test the theory by
   first conducting microlevel analysis of Islamic separatist groups in
   three Southeast Asian countries and then analyzing a cross-sectional
   sample of Islamic rebel groups. Results show that highly
   institutionalized groups that have a central command system and control
   over constituent groups are less likely to attack during long religious
   holidays than on other days, and vice versa for weakly institutionalized
   groups.},

Abstract = {Within research and policy on preventing and countering terrorism,
   transparency is viewed as a necessity to generate public support and
   trust for counter-terrorism policies. Yet there is no systematic
   evidence to support these assumptions while research in other policy
   areas has challenged these assumptions, showing some forms of
   transparency might decrease support and trust. This paper presents
   results from two experimental surveys conducted in the United Kingdom to
   examine the effect of increased transparency on support and trust for
   terrorism prevention policy. Our findings challenge the widely held
   assumptions with regard counter-terrorism policy: increased policy
   information about a prevention policy (based on real Prevent websites)
   decreases support for Prevent, it makes people less likely to report
   suspected radicalisation to Prevent, and it has no effect on trust.
   Conversely, transparency which communicates the rationale behind policy
   decisions (in this case, the controversial Prevent referral process)
   increases policy acceptance, decreases the intent to protest, and
   increases trust in the prevention programme. The findings have global
   implications for counter-terrorism policy which is primarily based on
   positive, linear assumption on the relationship between transparency,
   trust and support-the most common form of transparency these policies
   use is at best ineffective and at worse counter-productive.},

Title = {In the Eyes of the Beholders: The Legitimacy of Global Governance
   Institutions under Multipolarity},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Multipolarity has ambiguous implications for the legitimacy of global
   governance institutions (GGIs). Rising powers' capacity to contest
   established powers' agendas prima facie increases the GGIs' legitimacy
   by reducing power asymmetries between the North and South. However,
   according to some, the rise of new powers has contributed to the GGIs'
   poor performance and inadequate representativeness. We investigate how
   global publics evaluate the legitimacy of two GGIs-the World Trade
   Organization (WTO) and the Group of Twenty (G20)-and multipolarity's
   role in those evaluations. Drawing on an original dataset of 3,584
   newspaper articles sampled from rising and established powers,
   mid-ranking developing, and least developed countries between 2008 and
   2019, our qualitative content analysis found an intensification of
   legitimacy deficits over time. Regularly accredited to a new global
   power configuration, the inability to find consensus severely harmed
   both institutions' legitimacy. We also see the resilience of GGIs'
   legitimacy in the face of gridlocks and institutional fragmentation.
   Replacing inclusive multilateral agreements with bilateral or
   inter-regional ones was widely seen as an undesired outcome of major
   power tensions. Finally, our data revealed a deep-seated mistrust of
   great power politics and nostalgia for meaningful multilateral
   institutions as a potential antidote.
   La multipolaridad tiene implicaciones ambiguas para la legitimidad de
   las instituciones de gobernanza global (GGI, por sus siglas en ingl \&
   eacute;s). La capacidad de las potencias emergentes para impugnar las
   agendas de las potencias establecidas aumenta, a primera vista, la
   legitimidad de las GGI ya que reduce las asimetr \& iacute;as de poder
   entre el Norte y el Sur. Sin embargo, seg \& uacute;n algunas personas,
   el surgimiento de nuevos poderes ha contribuido a un pobre rendimiento
   de las GGI y a su insuficiente representatividad. Investigamos c \&
   oacute;mo los p \& uacute;blicos globales eval \& uacute;an la
   legitimidad de dos GGI, la Organizaci \& oacute;n Mundial del Comercio
   (OMC) y el Grupo de los Veinte (G20), as \& iacute; como el papel de la
   multipolaridad en esas evaluaciones. Nuestro an \& aacute;lisis de
   contenido cualitativo encontr \& oacute;, a partir de un conjunto de
   datos original de 3.584 art \& iacute;culos period \& iacute;sticos
   muestreados procedentes de potencias emergentes y establecidas, de pa \&
   iacute;ses en desarrollo de rango medio y de pa \& iacute;ses menos
   adelantados entre 2008 y 2019, una intensificaci \& oacute;n de los d \&
   eacute;ficits de legitimidad a lo largo del tiempo. La incapacidad para
   encontrar consensos da \& ntilde;\& oacute; gravemente la legitimidad de
   ambas instituciones, que estaban regularmente acreditadas a una nueva
   configuraci \& oacute;n de poder global. Tambi \& eacute;n observamos la
   resiliencia de la legitimidad de las GGI frente a los estancamientos y a
   la fragmentaci \& oacute;n institucionales. La sustituci \& oacute;n de
   los acuerdos multilaterales inclusivos por acuerdos bilaterales o
   interregionales se consider \& oacute;, en general, como un resultado no
   deseado de las tensiones entre las principales potencias. Por \&
   uacute;ltimo, nuestros datos revelaron una profunda desconfianza en la
   pol \& iacute;tica de las grandes potencias e identificaron la nostalgia
   por las instituciones multilaterales significativas como un potencial
   ant \& iacute;doto.
   La multipolarit \& eacute; s'accompagne d'implications ambigu \& euml;s

Title = {Catching Fire: How National Humiliation Spreads Hostile Foreign Policy
   Preferences on Chinese Social Media},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {Research shows that emotions alter preferences, which are central to
   many models of political choice. However, how can theories that explain
   individual-level preference change explain policy outcomes, which
   usually take place at higher levels of analysis? I outline three
   competing approaches to this question, ultimately building on the third
   approach, which argues that emotions can spread through emotional
   contagion within identity groups. This implies emotions can broadly
   shift preferences towards or away from conflict during crises. It also
   explains how identities, which are relatively constant over the medium
   term, can suddenly become fault lines in a conflict. I find supporting
   evidence using a large (more than 1.6 billion posts) nationally
   representative data set of Chinese social media posts. Users' national
   humiliation posts lead their followers to become more likely to make
   posts about national humiliation, suggesting contagion, and about using
   military force and maintaining territorial disputes, suggesting
   preference change.
   La investigacion demuestra que las emociones alteran las preferencias,
   las cuales son fundamentales para muchos modelos de eleccion politica.
   Sin embargo, como pueden las teorias referentes a los cambios de
   preferencias que se producen a nivel individual explicar los resultados
   de las politicas, que generalmente tienen lugar en niveles mas elevados
   de analisis? Esbozamos tres enfoques que compiten entre si con el fin de
   intentar responder esta pregunta, y en, ultima instancia, desarrollamos
   el tercero de estos enfoques, que argumenta que las emociones pueden
   propagarse a traves del contagio emocional dentro de los grupos
   identitarios. Esto implica que las emociones pueden cambiar ampliamente
   las preferencias durante las crisis, ya sea acercandose al conflicto o
   alejandose de este. El articulo tambien explica como las identidades,
   que son relativamente constantes a medio plazo, pueden convertirse, de
   repente, en problemas subyacentes en un conflicto. Encontramos pruebas
   que apoyan todo esto mediante el uso de un gran conjunto de datos
   representativos a nivel nacional (mas de 1.600 millones de
   publicaciones) de publicaciones en redes sociales chinas. Las
   publicaciones en materia de humillacion nacional por parte de los
   usuarios hacen que sus seguidores sean mas propensos a hacer
   publicaciones sobre la humillacion nacional, lo que sugiere el contagio,
   y sobre el uso de la fuerza militar y el mantenimiento de disputas
   territoriales, lo que sugiere un cambio de preferencias.
   La recherche a mis en evidence que les emotions modifiaient les
   preferences, centrales dans nombre de modeles de choix politique.
   Cependant, comment les theories qui explicitent le changement de
   preferences au niveau individuel expliquent les resultats politiques,
   qui interviennent souvent a un niveau d'analyse superieur? Je presente
   trois approches concurrentes a cette question, pour finir par me fonder
   sur la troisieme, selon laquelle les emotions peuvent se diffuser par
   ``contagion emotionnelle{''} au sein des groupes identitaires. Aussi les
   emotions pourraient-elles generalement modifier les preferences en
   faveur ou en defaveur d'un conflit par temps de crise. Cette approche
   explique aussi que les identites, relativement constantes sur le moyen
   terme, puissent devenir une faille dans un conflit. Je trouve des
   elements pour venir etayer mon propos dans un grand (plus de 1,6
   milliard de publications) ensemble de donnees representatif sur le plan
   national des publications chinoises sur les reseaux sociaux. Les
   publications d'utilisateurs traitant d'humiliation nationale augmentent
   la probabilite de leurs abonnes de publier a propos d'humiliation
   nationale, ce qui suggere une contagion, et de l'usage de la force
   militaire et du maintien des conflits territoriaux, ce qui suggere une
   modification des preferences.},

Abstract = {State-building by external actors can be understood as a practice of
   intervention in post-conflict spaces characterized by convergences and
   contestations between different actors striving for power and
   legitimacy. Informal non-state (armed) groups and clientele networks
   profit from the contingencies during transition and ``capture{''}
   emerging formal state institutions to secure private gains and public
   positions. Order in this newly formed state is established through a
   dynamic process involving both external actors and domestic power
   networks. Most of the literature on intervention either focuses on
   top-down effects of external actors or resistance by local actors, thus
   falling short of describing the timeless ties of post-war networks and
   individuals in their day-to-day interaction patterns. How can we then
   understand the interaction and collusion between post-conflict power
   networks and external ``statebuilders{''}? We use Bourdieu's concept of
   the field to examine the local spaces of interventions and argue that
   interventions are social and relational practices characterized by
   day-to-day routines and overlapping, yet co-existing modes of formal and
   informal interactions. Empirically, we rely on qualitative social
   network analysis and interviews to visibilize these social practices and
   collusion between external actors and power networks in Kosovo and its
   impact on ``state-building{''} efforts by the international community.

   las redes clientelares se benefician de las contingencias ocurridas
   durante la transici \& oacute;n y << capturan >> las instituciones
   estatales formales emergentes con el fin de asegurarse tanto ganancias
   privadas como posiciones p \& uacute;blicas. En este nuevo Estado, el
   orden se establece a trav \& eacute;s de un proceso din \& aacute;mico
   que involucra tanto a agentes externos como a redes de poder nacionales.
   La mayor parte de la literatura existente en materia de intervenci \&
   oacute;n se centra en los efectos descendentes derivados de los agentes
   externos o en la resistencia por parte de los agentes locales, por lo
   que no llega a describir los v \& iacute;nculos atemporales de las redes
   y los individuos de la posguerra en sus patrones de interacci \&
   oacute;n cotidiana. \& iquest;C \& oacute;mo podemos entender, entonces,
   la interacci \& oacute;n y la colusi \& oacute;n entre las redes de
   poder posteriores al conflicto y los << constructores de Estado >>
   externos? Utilizamos el concepto de campo de Bourdieu con el fin de
   examinar los espacios locales de intervenci \& oacute;n y argumentamos
   que las intervenciones son pr \& aacute;cticas sociales y relacionales,
   caracterizadas por rutinas cotidianas y modos de interacciones formales
   e informales que se superponen, pero que tambi \& eacute;n coexisten. De
   manera emp \& iacute;rica, partimos del an \& aacute;lisis cualitativo
   de las redes sociales y de entrevistas con el objetivo de visibilizar
   estas pr \& aacute;cticas sociales y la colusi \& oacute;n entre agentes
   externos y redes de poder en Kosovo, as \& iacute; como su impacto en
   los esfuerzos de << construcci \& oacute;n del Estado >> por parte de la
   comunidad internacional.
   La cr \& eacute;ation d'\& Eacute;tats par des acteurs externes peut
   s'appr \& eacute;hender telle une pratique d'intervention dans les
   espaces post-conflit caract \& eacute;ris \& eacute;s par des
   convergences et des contestations entre diff \& eacute;rents acteurs \&
   agrave; la recherche de pouvoir et de l \& eacute;gitimit \& eacute;.
   Les groupes (arm \& eacute;s) non \& eacute;tatiques informels et les r
   \& eacute;seaux de client \& egrave;le b \& eacute;n \& eacute;ficient
   des contingences lors d'une transition et << capturent >> les
   institutions \& eacute;tatiques formelles \& eacute;mergentes pour s \&
   eacute;curiser des gains priv \& eacute;s et des positions publiques.
   Dans cet \& Eacute;tat nouvellement \& eacute;tabli, l'ordre s'\&
   eacute;tablit au travers d'un processus dynamique impliquant \& agrave;
   la fois des acteurs externes et des r \& eacute;seaux de pouvoir
   nationaux. La majorit \& eacute; de la litt \& eacute;rature sur
   l'intervention se focalise sur les effets descendants des acteurs
   externes ou sur la r \& eacute;sistances des acteurs locaux, et donc ne
   d \& eacute;crit pas les liens intemporels entre les r \& eacute;seaux
   d'apr \& egrave;s-guerre et les individus au sein de leurs sch \&
   eacute;mas d'interactions quotidiens. Alors, comment pouvons-nous
   comprendre les interactions et collusions entre les r \& eacute;seaux de
   pouvoir d'apr \& egrave;s-guerre et les << cr \& eacute;ateurs d'\&
   Eacute;tats >> externes ? Nous employons le concept bourdieusien de
   champ pour examiner les espaces locaux d'interventions avant d'affirmer
   que les interventions sont des pratiques sociales et relationnelles,
   caract \& eacute;ris \& eacute;es par des routines quotidiennes et des
   interactions formelles et informelles qui se chevauchent mais
   coexistent. Sur le plan empirique, nous nous fondons sur une analyse
   qualitative de r \& eacute;seau social et sur des entretiens pour faire
   appara \& icirc;tre ces pratiques sociales et collusions entre acteurs
   externes et r \& eacute;seaux de pouvoir au Kosovo ainsi que leurs cons
   \& eacute;quences sur les efforts de << cr \& eacute;ation \&
   eacute;tatique >> de la communaut \& eacute; internationale.},

Title = {Evidence from Albania: local government, public goods, and the
   free-rider problem},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Public goods and their benefits are necessarily related to their nature.
   From an economic point of view, citizens are always looking for more and
   more public goods, judging that they should always finance them even
   less. Especially in a democracy, it is sufficient to remember that
   people who don't vote still benefit from the government's agenda. Mainly
   in developing countries and especially in ex-communist ones, the public
   does not have enough literacy and interest to understand the issues of
   public finance, political economy, the fiscal system, legal and
   political systems, social paradigms, and economics. So, it generally
   attributes the provision of public goods necessarily to the central and
   local governments without understanding or knowing any of the elements
   of the public goods ecosystem. So it seems that everything that the
   local government provides must be of high quality and be free, which
   proves evidence and traces of one of the main problems of public goods,
   which is the free-rider problem. From the research point of view,
   regardless of the moderation made by the civil society for the awareness
   of the social contract as well as the transparency of the economic
   activity of the municipalities, the citizens' awareness about the nature
   and problems of the provision of public goods still remains a concern.
   Therefore, the purpose of this article is to address the free-rider
   problem as an issue that must be recognized and considered so that
   optimal local legal regulations can be formulated, especially in small
   communities like Vlora municipality, where the free-rider problem is on
   a smaller scale compared to larger municipalities in the world.},

   aftermath of war},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-35},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Strategy is a theory of victory; grand strategy is a theory of security.
   In the ideal, a state's strategy and grand strategy are mutually
   reinforcing. Wartime decisions should leave the state more secure in the
   aftermath, and peacetime decisions should put the state in a good
   position in the event of future conflict. Yet for various reasons,
   strategy and grand strategy often drift apart. This article focuses on
   one type of decoupling. Victorious states tend to expand their grand
   strategic ambitions, yet nostalgia encourages them to retain
   increasingly outmoded strategic concepts. Losers, by contrast, are more
   likely to have frank conversations about the real opportunities and
   limits of state power, and the ways in which military action can provide
   meaningful support. I illustrate the argument with case studies from the
   British experience in the American War of Independence, and the American
   experience in the first Persian Gulf War.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how the type of elite to which a person
   belongs and their intergenerational contextual experiences are
   associated with attitudes towards inequality among elite individuals. We
   propose that membership of the economic elite and access to private
   schools, higher education business schools and affluent residential
   areas may contribute to the development of views that favour inequality.
   Using unique survey data collected in 2018 from a sample of 416
   individuals belonging to Chile's economic, political and cultural
   elites, we construct an additive score to measure attitudes towards
   inequality. Results of our regression analyses indicate that individuals
   belonging to the economic and political elite are more tolerant of
   inequality than members of the cultural elite. Moreover,
   intergenerational experiences at both private schools and higher
   education business schools significantly contribute to the formation of
   attitudes that favour inequality. These contextual experiences also
   relate to significant attitudinal variations within all elite groups.},

Abstract = {Policy growth is a ubiquitous feature of modern democracies that has
   attracted increased attention in political science and beyond. However,
   the literature is characterised by considerable disagreement on why
   policy growth occurs. Existing explanations centre on the influence of
   (1) public demands, (2) interest group politics, (3) electoral
   competition, and (4) institutional fragmentation. While all four
   explanations are plausible, there are no studies that assess their
   relative explanatory power within a single empirical analysis. This
   article provides such an analysis by examining the drivers of policy
   growth in 21 OECD countries from 1976 to 2020 in the area of
   environmental policy. We identify strong ties between organised
   interests and the government as the primary driver of policy growth.
   Public demands and institutional fragmentation are relevant but
   comparatively less important factors, while the intensity of electoral
   competition has no influence on policy growth. These findings have
   important implications for our understanding of the functioning of
   democracy in the long run.},

Abstract = {This article asks if the measures of human capital, ethnic diversity,
   and gender equality from 1930 explain current levels of human capital in
   Romania, while also assessing the role of macro-regional differences in
   the manifestation of historical legacies. We focus on human capital,
   measured by educational attainment and by conscientiousness, a
   personality trait we estimate using a behavioral measure. The analysis
   is based on a recent large-scale national survey from 2019-2020 and
   census data from 1930. We find that contemporary human capital levels
   are influenced by a combination of factors, including historical human
   capital levels, ethnic diversity, and gender equality. Additionally, we
   show that the long-term impact of these factors can vary by region.
   Specifically, our study identifies four distinct long-term effects
   within the historical region of Transylvania and two in the rest of the
   country. In Transylvania, the present educational attainment is shaped
   by both the 1930 literacy rate and gender equality, while in the other
   regions, only the literacy rate exerts a statistically significant
   influence. Similarly, when it comes to current levels of
   conscientiousness, Transylvania's levels are affected by both the 1930
   literacy rate and ethnolinguistic fractionalization, whereas in the rest
   of the country, only ethnolinguistic fractionalization has a
   statistically significant impact.},

Abstract = {Through the analysis of ECB Executive Board member speeches, we have
   identified three main narratives about the consequences of the
   environmental crisis in the monetary authority's spheres of influence:
   The first emphasises environmental phenomena as financial risks; the
   second highlights the green investment or financing gap; and the third
   focuses on the impacts of climate change on price stability. These
   narratives lead to different forms of legitimisation in terms of why and
   how the central bank should intervene to tackle climate change. We show
   that the third narrative is displacing the first as the dominant
   discourse around ECB climate policy. The shift in focus from the central
   bank's duties to maintain financial stability to its responsibilities
   regarding price stability under the primary mandate could lead to
   far-reaching green monetary policies. However, based on the concept of
   layered structures, we argue that this change does not signal a
   departure from market liberal central banking but rather a shift within
   the prevailing system. What we are witnessing is a new form of market
   liberalism adapted to climate change, or market liberalism in climate
   crisis mode.},

Abstract = {This article uses the case of Colombia to evaluate the gendered risks of
   social leadership and human rights activism in territories governed by
   armed groups. Existing data on Colombian human rights and social leader
   deaths reveals that men leaders are being killed at a much higher rate
   than women social leaders. In this article, we delve deeper into
   gendered patterns of violence against men and women leaders by focusing
   specifically on the content of the threats these leaders receive from
   armed groups. We analyzed 40 qualitative interviews with men and women
   social leaders who have worked in nine different conflict regions of
   Colombia to find that armed actors target men and women leaders with
   uniquely gender-specific threats. These findings tell us a great deal,
   not only about how armed groups govern those in the territories they
   control, but also about the gender biases they hold about men and women
   leaders who challenge their authority. Although women leader deaths are
   less common than those of their male counterparts, the threats and
   violence both receive are grounded in stereotypical gender norms, and
   thus merit gender-sensitive, context-specific analyses and responses.},

Abstract = {There is substantial cross-national variation in the level of regulatory
   clarity surrounding cryptocurrencies. What explains these differences?
   And, more broadly, what drives the divergent historical development of
   market regulation in different jurisdictions? To answer these questions,
   we present a new conceptual framework centered on the concept of market
   legibility. This term, inspired by the sociological literature, refers
   to the extent to which markets are made legible to the state through
   standardization. We contend that state supply of, and market demand for,
   legibility drives the primary political-economic dynamics of market
   regulation. Specifically, these factors combine to produce ideal type
   states of legibility that correspond to both distinct stages of market
   development and the relative level of regulatory clarity in any one
   jurisdiction. This framework is utilized to conduct a comparative
   historical analysis of cryptocurrency regulation in the EU, US, UK, and
   Japan. By performing these tasks, this article corrects the common
   assumption that states are constantly striving to impose their authority
   on unwilling markets. It demonstrates instead that state and private
   actor preferences to make markets legible vary, conditioning, in turn,
   the political economy of regulatory governance.},

Abstract = {Can representation in foreign policy deliberations - in particular,
   increased female representation - impact deliberators' support for
   interstate conflict resolution? While existing work on gender
   representation in IR suggests that increased female representation
   should moderate intragroup hawkishness, making conflict resolution more
   viable, I offer empirical evidence that qualifies this idea, based on a
   survey experiment on 149 male and 55 female elite Pakistani legislators.
   Politicians of both sexes were randomly assigned to `listen in' on a
   hypothetical national security deliberation that was either all-male or
   gender-mixed. I find that politicians' decisionmaking in these
   hypothetical committees was informed simultaneously by notions of
   committee competence and by inferences about the social desirability of
   hawkish outcomes in deliberative settings. Specifically, respondents
   assigned to gender-mixed committees became less supportive of external
   conflict resolution. I show how different mechanisms accounted for this
   increased hawkishness for men and women. Female politicians assigned to
   gender-mixed committees became more conscious and wary of how their
   participation, the result of increased representation, would be
   perceived, compelling them to opt for more hawkish policies. Male
   politicians, in contrast, attempted to overcompensate for the increased
   visibility of female representation by resorting to greater levels of
   aggression.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly influenced public interventions
   concerning citizens' emotions. This paper delves into the associated
   policy discourse by examining the link between individual accounts of
   psychosocial well-being and their portrayal in public through policies
   and regulatory actions. The concept of emotional boundaries of home,
   elucidated through an analysis of citizen experiences during the initial
   year of the pandemic's lockdowns, encompasses both material and
   affective dimensions of the home. These dimensions intertwine with
   emotions that traverse the private and public aspects of psychosocial
   well-being. The emotional boundaries of home highlight the ambivalence
   of policy interventions in either supporting or mitigating specific
   emotions. This ambivalence stems from associating these emotions more
   with individual and private realms than their intersection with
   material, spatial, or structural conditions, constituting a critical
   insight from the dataset. The findings emphasize the need to acknowledge
   how feelings are framed as private within policy discourse, advocating
   for a discourse that addresses the repercussions of such framing. By
   initiating this discussion, the article contributes to critical policy
   scholarship on emotions.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to describe and analyze the social
   representations of democracy, populism and the relationship between both
   concepts in a sample of citizens from different regions of Peru (n =
   76). To this end, a qualitative research design was proposed, using
   in-depth interviews, which were analyzed from a discursive approach. The
   results show that democracy and populism are two closely related
   concepts in tension. On the one hand, the social representation of
   democracy is semantically poor, closely related to electoral behavior
   and is seen as a political system that, ideally, is positively valued.
   Populism, on the other hand, is seen as a political strategy based on
   the manipulation of citizens' needs in order to reach power using the
   democratic process of elections. The representation of populism in
   general is negative, and it is mentioned that it appears and acquires
   strength in the face of citizen dissatisfaction with democracy, when it
   cannot solve problems of poverty, corruption or exclusion. The
   representations of populism take up the constitutive components proposed
   by different authors on the topic (people, elites and democracy as a
   product of popular will), but the participants do not necessarily
   structure the relationships between these components as proposed in the
   academic literature. Finally, the results shows that respondents'
   experiences with democracy and populism in Peru act as important
   socializing forces that will frame how citizens relate to politics and
   the public.},

Abstract = {The UN reform movement calls for the UN Security Council to be changed.
   The underlying assumption is that it will create thicker decision-making
   that will allow more views on the causes of, dynamics of, and solutions
   to conflicts. This paper adopts a comparative analysis of three cycles
   of narratives in the UN Security Council and emergency sessions of the
   UN General Assembly when both bodies debated the same issue of violence
   in the Gaza Strip. The findings reveal that, unlike its public image,
   the emergency sessions of the UN General Assembly were used to make the
   analysis thinner and less descriptive. Another finding is that it was
   predominantly Arab, Muslim, and revisionist Latin American countries
   that influenced the majority to adopt the thin narrative.},

Abstract = {This study uses a vignette-based survey experiment for recycling
   programs in Korea to examine how different messages of a public
   information campaign as a policy instrument affect the attitudes and
   behaviors of citizens. It tests hypotheses based on construal-level
   theory, which suggests that people tend to be more affected by abstract
   messages under distant psychological conditions and by concrete messages
   under proximal psychological conditions. In contrast to the conventional
   assumption of construal-level theory, this study shows that people
   appear to be more affected by concrete and specific messages (mundane
   instructions for ``how and what to recycle{''}) than by abstract
   messages (a noble vision and goal for ``why to recycle{''}) under both
   distant and proximal conditions.},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {As the Russia-Ukraine war enters its third year, Ukraine faces a
   daunting task: how to restore its military advantage. To maximise
   Ukraine's chances of eventual victory, Western countries need to
   recognise that the driving engine of Ukraine's effectiveness has been a
   destruction-centred approach. This approach has resulted in high levels
   of attrition and could prove an important part of the West's and
   Ukraine's theory of victory. The West enjoys the overall advantage in
   resources and should therefore focus on facilitating Ukraine's ability
   to establish a decisive advantage in fires. The West also needs to help
   Ukraine scale its capacity to employ units so that it can exploit that
   advantage in offensive operations. The West will need to appreciate
   Ukrainian force structure and military culture, as well as the
   challenges posed by an increasingly mobilised military, which means
   avoiding the temptation to try to convert the Ukrainian military to a
   more Western, manoeuvre-centred way of fighting.},

Abstract = {Techno-strategic trends in the Western Pacific are challenging the US
   Navy's ability to command the seas and project power ashore. Chinese
   anti-access and area-denial capabilities outrange the striking power of
   a carrier-centric US Navy, forcing Pentagon strategists to look for new
   capabilities and tactics to influence events along the Asian littorals.
   This essay reviews Brent Droste Sadler's book U.S. Naval Power in the
   21st Century, which surveys the technical, manufacturing and logistical
   weaknesses that stand in the way of a larger and more capable navy, and
   offers suggestions for how the navy might regain its position of
   prominence in the Western Pacific. Although Sadler's suggestions are
   practical, they underplay the organisational and cultural obstacles that
   will hinder the types of reforms needed to prepare the US Navy for a new
   age of great-power competition.},

Abstract = {In many rural communities in South Africa, including Umzumbe Local
   Municipality (ULM) in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), the delivery of high -quality
   infrastructure for sustainable rural livelihoods has not yet been fully
   realised. Despite legislative changes on infrastructure improvement,
   rural residents are still overwhelmed with daunting challenges that have
   dire consequences for human and socio-economic development. This study
   sought to explore the existing infrastructure at ULM for the attainment
   of sustainable livelihoods. It examines the prominent contributing
   factors that obstruct infrastructural development for the attainment of
   optimal sustainable development. Data drawn from interviews were
   gathered for this explanatory qualitative case study from a targeted
   sample of 12 participants while 30 participants participated in the
   focus group. Secondary data was, however, collected from relevant
   literature and official documents and analysed thematically. Findings
   revealed that rural areas, such as the ULM are still enduring
   unsatisfactory infrastructural access, quality and reliability. The
   existing efforts to advance infrastructure improvement are seemingly
   unproductive as a result of several shortcomings including inept public
   management.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on anti-communist practices conducted by the
   Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the first half of the 20th
   century. We believe that anti-communism was fostered by Itamaraty's
   conservative and aristocratic ethos, playing an important role in
   Brazilian foreign policy from Rio Branco's administration (1902-1912) to
   the Vargas Era (1930 - 1945). This helped shape the authoritarian
   foreign policy adopted during the Military Dictatorship twenty years
   later (1964 - 1985). Therefore, the foreign policy of the dictatorship,
   rather than a ``step out of cadence,{''} is rather a continuity of
   practices established long before the Cold War.},

Abstract = {This article examines the phenomenon of feminist foreign policy (FFP) in
   Europe. Following the adoption of so-called ``feminist{''} foreign
   policies in Europe (e.g., in France, Luxembourg, Spain, Germany, and
   Sweden until 2022), a growing debate has emerged regarding the extent to
   which this global trend presents a sustained normative shift. By
   applying norm life cycle models designed by constructivist scholars,
   this article systematically assesses the tipping point that a norm must
   exceed to diffuse successfully on the international stage. Steady path
   directions of FFP norms and the motion of gravitational forces are
   considered as potential key indicators for such a tipping point.
   Discourse analysis revealed a gap between rhetoric (promoting a
   progressive and structurally disruptive concept of FFP) and practice
   (revealing a narrow understanding of FFP comparable with gender
   mainstreaming). Nevertheless, FFP continues to raise awareness regarding
   gender issues in international politics, and it represents a new
   normative dimension that is seeking gradual acceptance.},

Abstract = {In order to give full play to the advantages of local governance
   structure, it is necessary to explore the influence of governance
   structure on college students' cultural identity and self-confidence. In
   this paper, a questionnaire survey was conducted on four college
   students in Henan Province, and the regression analysis method was used
   to analyze the survey data. Based on the analysis results, from the
   perspective of local governance structure, the relationship between
   local governance structure and college students' cultural identity and
   self-confidence is demonstrated. This paper puts forward the following
   hypotheses: first, whether the structure of local autonomy has an impact
   on the cultural identity of college students; second, whether the
   relationship between college students' identity and self-confidence is
   independent; thirdly, whether the local self-control structure can
   improve the self-confidence of college students; Finally, the influence
   and degree of local self-government structure and cultural identity of
   college students on college students' self-confidence. The results show
   that the local structure can improve the cultural level of college
   students, with an increase of about 10.5\%, and the impact on the
   cultural self-confidence of college students is relatively small,
   indicating that there is a correlation between cultural identity and
   local governance structure, and the correlation between cultural
   self-confidence is small, and the relationship between cultural identity
   and self-confidence is independent. The reason for this is that the
   short -term effect of the local governance structure is significant, and
   the long-term effect is not good, so it is necessary to cooperate with
   social participation measures, university system and other measures to
   enhance students' cultural self-confidence.},

   {[}Anonymous], 7 Whether it is possible to use phylogenetic data to determine the transmission of HIV virus from one person to another is a matter of active contestation in the HIV community. CDC and an international cohort of experts on this topic insist that it not possible using currently available methods. However, some scholars and activists claim that the science behind this statement is immaterial in the hands of over-zealous actors. I explore aspects of this controversy in the pages that follow, but it is not a central focus.

Abstract = {In recent years, the US has been escalating sanctions on China's
   semiconductor industry, attributing these measures to national security
   concerns in official statements. This study employs a realism theory
   framework to analyse these sanctions, emphasizing their connection to US
   national security. US national security aims to achieve global influence
   in both military and non-military domains, with the semiconductor
   industry playing a crucial role in US national security and economic
   stability. The emerging capabilities of China's semiconductor industry
   pose potential challenges to these critical aspects. In the military
   domain, China has deployed artificial intelligence and 5G technologies
   for military purposes, attaining capabilities comparable to the US.
   These technologies heavily rely on semiconductor chips as hardware
   support. In response, the US targets China's semiconductor industry,
   aiming to indirectly impede China's military competition. Additionally,
   the US position in the global semiconductor manufacturing value chain
   renders it relatively vulnerable. Given the US dependence on key
   products manufactured in China, concerns about the security of the
   semiconductor value chain arise. Therefore, motivated by national
   security considerations, the US has implemented significant sanctions on
   China's semiconductor industry to address the military and economic
   threats posed by China.},

Abstract = {This study examines NATO's cohesion amid global power competition,
   focusing on the alliance's internal and external determinants from 2002
   to 2023. Using cluster analysis, it evaluates 19 variables across
   political, military, security, and economic factors to identify
   divergences among traditional and new member states. The findings reveal
   a heterogeneous alliance influenced by economic disparities, divergent
   threat perceptions, and unequal military spending. However, external
   threats, particularly Russia's aggression, have fostered temporary
   solidarity. The study highlights the strategic implications of NATO's
   cohesion for its deterrence and defence roles, emphasizing the need for
   equitable burden-sharing and synchronized policies to mitigate
   fragmentation. The research offers policy recommendations to strengthen
   NATO's relevance and adaptability in a contested global landscape.},

Abstract = {The term ``Balkanisation{''} is used in the description of unstable
   regions where actors of international relations (states and peoples) are
   most often in continuous and intractable conflicts. Why did the Balkans
   become the birthplace of this term? Why do the conflicts in the Balkans
   last and seem intractable in the long term? In searching for answers to
   these research questions, the author relies on the methods of discourse
   analysis (examining perceptions) and comparative analysis (comparing
   perceptions that are mutually opposed and irreconcilable). The
   theoretical framework of this research is based on a combination of
   theses of social constructivism (perceptions that shape ontological
   security) and structural realism (as perceptions materialise in certain
   foreign and security policies of states). The hypothesis being proven is
   as follows: confl ict potential in the Balkans is determined by
   ontological factors that represent important factors of security
   perceptions of different nations and geopolitical conceptions of
   different states. As a result, different perceptions influence the
   formation of opposing geopolitical conceptions, which leads to
   continuous appearances of aspirations for a territorial reconfiguration
   of space and changing borders, which is why a high level of interstate
   and/or interethnic mistrust is maintained over a long period of time.
   The concluding remarks are devoted to the presentation of views on how
   there are several reasons for Balkanisation, since this process is
   influenced not only by Balkan actors, but also by non-Balkan actors (big
   and regional powers with their own perceptions and geopolitical
   conceptions). That is why the attempts to stabilise the region initiated
   during the previous century were generally short-lived and were limited
   in scope. The tangle of different perceptions and mutually
   irreconcilable geopolitical goals of Balkan and non-Balkan actors
   results in ongoing Balkanisation.},

Title = {Dynamics of organized violence in the wake of tropical cyclones},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 30},
Abstract = {Recent research highlights how the same vulnerabilities that lead to
   disasters also condition the impact of hazards on violent conflict. Yet
   it is common practice in the literature to proxy rapid-onset hazards
   with disaster impacts when studying political violence. This can bias
   upward estimates of hazard-conflict relationships and obscure
   heterogeneous effects, with implications for forecasting as well as
   disaster risk reduction and peace-building activities. To overcome this,
   we implement an approach that measures and models the separate
   components of a tropical cyclone event: the hazard, the exposure, and
   the impacts. We then estimate a set of models that quantify how the
   incidence and intensity of organized violence respond to hazard
   exposure. We find little evidence that the average tropical cyclone
   enhances or diminishes violent conflict at the country level over a
   two-year time horizon. Yet rather than signaling that storms do not
   matter for political violence, unpacking this average result reveals two
   countervailing effects within countries. Conflict, and especially
   one-sided violence against civilians, tends to escalate in regions
   directly exposed to the tropical cyclone. In contrast, areas outside the
   path of the storm may experience a decrease in conflict. These results
   are heterogeneous with tropical cyclone intensity, and conflict
   escalation is more likely to occur in settings with less effective
   governments. Our results underscore the importance of ex-ante efforts
   targeting government capacity and effective disaster risk reduction to
   moderate the risk of violent conflict in the wake of tropical cyclones.},

Title = {Low-carbon city development from a multi-level governance perspective: a
   comparative study of Shenzhen, China and the City of Darebin, Australia},

Abstract = {While countries worldwide have committed to their respective carbon
   reduction targets, and all levels of government are engaged in efforts
   to mitigate and adapt to climate change, the roles of multiple
   stakeholders in promoting low-carbon development and their interactive
   relationships vary significantly across nations. These differences
   result in varying progress and effectiveness in low-carbon development.
   In this context, this paper employs the concept of Multi-Level
   Governance (MLG) as an analytical framework to examine low-carbon city
   development in Shenzhen, China and the City of Darebin, Australia.
   Specifically, it compares the roles of multi-level governments and their
   interactions in low-carbon development in these two cities. The paper
   finds that Shenzhen's low carbon development is driven by the joint
   efforts of the central and local governments, along with coordination
   and partnerships with non-government stakeholders at the community
   level, reflecting a flexible vertical dimension of MLG. In contrast, the
   City of Darebin empowers the local council and residents to collectively
   envision and decide on low-carbon policies, highlighting the key
   features of the horizontal dimension of MLG.},

Abstract = {Developments in nuclear and precise nonnuclear munitions, cyber
   capabilities, and anti-satellite weapons are reducing the survivability
   of many nuclear command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I)
   assets. However, given the apparent invulnerability of a few such
   assets, the Chinese, Russian, and U.S. systems for enabling retaliation
   after an attempted disarming strike are currently survivable. Moreover,
   if states take advantage of countervailing technological developments -
   most importantly, large constellations of small satellites - those
   systems are likely to remain survivable. That said, some trade-offs -
   between survivable C3I capabilities and survivable delivery systems, and
   between resilience against kinetic attack and cyberattack - will arise.},

Abstract = {In recent years, security policy attitudes have surged to the forefront
   of public discourse, especially amidst geopolitical shifts like Russia's
   incursions into Ukraine and China's assertiveness in the South Asian
   Sea. Yet, despite its significance, scholarly focus on these attitudes,
   particularly concerning the will to resist foreign aggression, remains
   scant. This research endeavors to fill this gap by exploring the
   correlation between economic resources, primarily tangible asset
   ownership, and defense-related attitudes. Drawing on multiyear survey
   data from Finland - a nation uniquely positioned given its mandatory
   military service for males and its proximity to Russia's sphere of
   interest - we find a strong association between tangible asset ownership
   and an increased willingness among citizens to resist foreign
   incursions. This relationship becomes even more pronounced during times
   of geopolitical uncertainty, underscoring the importance of the
   prevailing security environment in shaping these attitudes. While we do
   not refute previous arguments regarding increased economic opportunities
   leading to decreased war proclivity, we emphasize the conditional nature
   of this relationship, contingent upon the immediate threat to one's
   material possessions. In essence, citizens are more inclined to defend
   what they have when the specter of war looms large.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often leads to elevated
   blood glucose levels and lipid metabolism disorder, which is generally
   accompanied by dysbiosis of gut microbiota and metabolic dysfunction.
   Method: In this study, a mouse model of T2DM was established by feeding
   a high-fat/sucrose diet combined with injecting a low dose of
   streptozotocin. The aim of this study was to analyze the regulatory
   effect of Suaeda salsa extract (SSE) on T2DM and its effect on the
   intestinal flora of mice. Results: The results showed that SSE could
   significantly improve the body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), area
   under the curve (AUC) of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT),
   glycosylated serum protein (GSP) and islet function index. Moreover,
   4-week body weight, FBG, AUC of OGTT, GSP, as well as intestinal acetic
   and butyric acid were significantly better in the SSE-L than in the MET
   group (p < 0.05). In addition, it was also found that the potential
   hypoglycemic mechanism of SSE was related to the expression of Akt
   serine/threonine kinase (AKT-1) and glucose transporter-2 (GLUT-2)
   genes. Compared with the model group, SSE intervention significantly
   increased the abundance of probiotics, such as Soleaferrea,
   Alloprevotella, Lactobacillus and Faecalibaculum, while decreasing the
   relative abundance of harmful bacteria, such as Phocaeicola and
   Bilophila. Analysis of the correlation among intestinal microbiota,
   short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the hypoglycemic index showed that
   Dwaynesavagella was significantly correlated with acetic, propionic and
   butyric acid, as well as all the diabetes-related indexes analyzed in
   this study. Discussion: Thus, this taxon can potentially be used as a
   microbiological marker of type 2 diabetes. Taken together, these
   findings demonstrate that SSE can alleviate T2DM and its complications
   by improving glycemia-related indicators and modulating the structure of
   intestinal flora.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Abstract = {The Paris summit of 1974 produced an informal agreement to renounce a
   previous informal agreement, the famous Luxembourg Compromise of 1966
   about qualified majority voting (QMV). The dominant view within existing
   scholarship is that the Paris summit had no effect because the
   Luxembourg Compromise and its consensus norm persisted at least into the
   1980s: QMV was inoperative before and remained inoperative after. Using
   quantitative analysis and extensive process tracing, we provide the
   first systematic empirical test of this conventional view and of the
   summit's effects. Although superficially our null finding (no effect)
   appears to confirm previous accounts, it constitutes further evidence
   against prevailing `veto culture' narratives and challenges existing
   theories about informal institutions and institutional change.},

Abstract = {Broad-based climate movements are important shapers and signallers of
   public demand for efficacious policies to tackle climate change and,
   through demonstrative and disruptive action, creating windows for policy
   change. Here, we use a unique protest survey dataset to develop a
   comparative framework for understanding the drivers of protest
   participation in two tactically different major climate protests in
   London staged by the same organisation. Crucially, these protests take
   place at different phases of the policy window and have different action
   premises: Extinction Rebellion's (XR) `arrestable' protests in 2019, and
   its much more conventional and lawful actions in 2023. By focusing on
   action design we are able to compare across cases and contrast the
   drivers of participation in arrestable and lawful actions respectively.
   By disaggregating variables through bivariate and multivariate analysis,
   we develop an authoritative approach to the drivers of protest, teasing
   out the respective importance of different elements of biographical,
   structural and political availability. We find that, aside from
   part-time working, biographical availability is not a reliable predictor
   of participation in the different forms of protest. In contrast,
   structural availability, and bonding capital in particular, matters
   more. XR's arrestable 2019 protests, which had significant policy
   influence, successfully mobilised more strongly committed participants
   than its lawful 2023 protests.},

Abstract = {Since 2010, the European Union has been challenged by rogue Member
   States that reject its fundamental values. The European Commission
   cajoled, expressed concern and occasionally brought infringement
   actions. Yet autocratisation continued. Then the EU passed three
   regulations with the 2021-2027 EU budget cycle and in response to the
   COVID-19 pandemic that explicitly permitted the Union to freeze funds to
   rogue Member States. At the end of 2022, the EU had acted on all three,
   freezing all non-agricultural funds to Hungary and Poland. Did this
   action restore EU values? The results are mixed. One the one hand, given
   the financial stakes, the funding freezes spurred rogue governments'
   responses and moved rogue states' publics to challenge their leaders
   more than any other mechanism had. On the other, the EU has since
   buckled under pressure to unfreeze all funds to Poland and most to
   Hungary, both before meaningful changes were implemented. Therefore, the
   jury is still out on the longer-term impact and benefits of budgetary
   conditionality, and on the question of whether we will see a definitive
   move away from the default of Money for Nothing.},

Abstract = {Why might female leaders of democratic countries commit more money,
   equipment, soldiers, and other resources to interstate conflicts than
   male leaders? We argue that gender bias in the process of democratic
   election helps explain this behavior. Since running for office is
   generally more costly for women than for men, only women who place a
   higher value on winning competitions will choose to run. After election,
   they also devote more resources to pursuing victory in conflict
   situations. To provide microfoundational evidence for this claim, we
   analyze data from an online laboratory game featuring real-time group
   play in which participants chose to run for election, conducted a simple
   campaign, and represented their group in a contest game if elected.
   Women with a higher nonmonetary value to winning were more likely to
   self-select into candidacy, and when victorious, they spent more
   resources on intergroup contests than male elected leaders. The data
   suggest that electoral selection plays an important role in observed
   differences between male and female leaders in the real world.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that open, collaborative, and transparent
   organizations are innovative. But some of the most radical
   innovations-satellites, lithium-iodine batteries, the internet-were
   conceived by small, secretive teams in national security agencies. Are
   these organizations more innovative because of their secrecy, or in
   spite of it? We study a principal-agent model of public-sector
   innovation. We give research teams a secret option and a public option
   during the initial testing and prototyping phase. Secrecy helps advance
   high-risk, high-reward projects through the early phase via a
   cost-passing mechanism. In open institutions, managers will not approve
   pilot research into high-risk, high-reward ideas for fear of political
   costs. Researchers exploit secrecy to conduct pilot research at a higher
   personal cost to generate evidence that their project is viable and win
   their manager's approval. Contrary to standard principal-agent findings,
   we show that researchers may exploit secrecy even if their preferences
   are perfectly aligned with their manager's, and that managers do not
   monitor researchers even if monitoring is costless and perfect. We

Title = {School disengagement as a policy problem: a frame analysis},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 16},
Abstract = {School disengagement has become acritical policy concern worldwide.
   Taking the Australian context as an empirical case, this paper aims to
   understand how school disengagement has been framed as apolicy problem
   and what issues remained unproblemised. Guided by policy frame as
   aconceptual tool and frame analysis as the methodological approach, the
   paper analyses two purposefully selected national policies relevant to
   school disengagement. The findings are categorized into three themes:
   policy problem, policy response, and policy silence. The findings show
   that the problem of school disengagement is narrowly framed as passive
   learning, disruptive behavior, and parents' lack of reliable information
   about their children's progress. The policies call for schools to
   improve student transition and work on understanding the root causes of
   behavior problems. The analysis also highlights apolicy silence: the
   impact of adverse learning environments on student engagement,
   wellbeing, and learning. In closing, the paper emphasizes the importance
   of framing school disengagement as aform of educational disadvantage
   that necessitates transformative policy measures.},

Abstract = {Aid organizations spend considerable time lobbying for aid to be sent to
   refugees in poorer states, rather than campaigning for more refugees to
   be resettled to wealthy states. Lawmakers in wealthy countries similarly
   tend to focus on aiding refugees abroad, rather than resettling more
   refugees into their countries. One justification raised for focusing on
   aid rather than resettlement is that refugees prefer to remain in poorer
   neighboring countries so that they can quickly repatriate when the time
   is safe. Yet, few have established what refugees' preferences are.
   Drawing upon an original data set of a representative sample of Syrian
   refugees in Lebanon, we find that most prefer remaining to resettling
   when the details of resettlement are not clarified, but roughly half
   prefer to resettle if offered certain types of resettlement. We further
   argue that organizations and states have reason to account for whether
   preferences are ``adaptive.{''} Such preferences arise when refugees
   prefer remaining in neighboring countries to resettling only when
   resettling to other countries is not an option, but would prefer
   resettling if this option were available. We present a novel
   philosophical reason for not appealing to adaptive preferences as a
   justification for not resettling refugees. We further apply a novel
   experimental method for evaluating whether preferences are adaptive.},

Abstract = {Washington is entertaining the idea that America and its allies face a
   new `axis of evil' consisting of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.
   Voices across the political spectrum want to make this grouping the
   focus of Western statecraft. But cooperation among these adversaries is
   modest overall, and treating them as a coherent bloc ignores important
   uncertainties about their future bonds. In the process, it risks
   creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Their growing bond may be an
   unanticipated geopolitical cost of the Russia-Ukraine war, but their
   cooperation will probably diminish when the war ends. The United States
   should focus on finding levers to weaken China's relationships with the
   other three - especially Russia - and in the meantime better prioritise
   its global commitments so that it is less exposed to coordinated
   attacks.},

Abstract = {In this article, I develop a novel relational egalitarian theory of
   social exclusion that explains how society fails to treat socially
   excluded individuals - such as people experiencing homelessness,
   individuals with substance use disorders and mental illness and sex
   workers - as equals. I argue that society places and keeps excluded
   individuals at the very bottom of the social status hierarchy by
   treating them as socially invisible, or by rendering them physically
   invisible, or both. The upshot, then, is that part of what is wrong with
   social exclusion is that it creates the invisible social class.},

Abstract = {Maritime governance has been immersed in growing techno-optimism.
   Technological developments have largely increased the capacity of states
   to render legible activities at sea and thus more effectively govern
   them. One area in which such techno-optimism has gained force but is yet
   to prove itself is the fight against Illegal, Unreported, and
   Unregulated (IUU) fishing. While technology-aided international
   cooperation has been crucial in curbing piracy, it has been slower to
   tame IUU fishing. In this article, we study international projects
   introducing technology-based solutions against IUU fishing in West
   Africa. Triangulating project documentation, donor evaluations,
   interviews, and other secondary sources, we assess how the
   techno-optimism driving those initiatives meets the techno-reality of
   their contexts of implementation. We find that, while grounds for
   optimism are far from unwarranted, realizing the potential of
   technological solutions against IUU fishing requires securing parallel
   cooperation that allows states to transform technology-based awareness
   into action.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {The extent to which people with intellectual disabilities (ID) are
   voting is an under-researched area. In order to fill this gap, we
   conducted a systematic literature review with a focus on voter turnout
   and democratic inclusiveness among people with ID. In total, we found N
   = 9 studies that met our inclusion criteria, all of which were based on
   samples from Western countries such as Croatia, Ireland, Netherlands,
   Sweden, Switzerland, UK and US. Our findings suggest that people with ID
   have substantially lower voter turnout than ordinary voters.
   Constraining factors for voting and other instances of democratic
   inclusion include educational limitations and physical obstacles at
   ballot places, as well as being under full guardianship. On the other
   hand, living in a household with a voter constitutes a facilitating
   factor. Because of the limited number of studies, we suggest that more
   basic quantitative and qualitative research in many countries ought to
   be conducted.},

Abstract = {I offer a response to Professor Joseph Stieb's article entitled
   `Rethinking Gore-War: Counterfactuals and the 2003 Iraq War'. In his
   critique of my book, Explaining the Iraq War: Counterfactual Theory,
   Logic and Evidence, Stieb claims that neoconservatives and right-wing
   hawks in the Bush administration were singularly responsible for
   mobilizing domestic and international support for the US-UK invasion
   based on fabricated threats about Iraq's WMD and links to 9/11, Al-Qaeda
   and globalized terrorism. The central objective of my book (and this
   reply) is to refute and repudiate Stieb's fundamentally flawed and
   simplistic `neoconist' account of the 2003 invasion.},

   lobbyists' clients},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {44},
Number = {4},
Pages = {697-719},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Lobbyists sometimes represent clients with seemingly adversarial policy
   interests. We seek to explain the occurrence of such ostensible
   conflicts of interest. In hiring lobbyists, interests encounter a
   tradeoff between access and agency. Although some lobbyists promise
   access to lawmakers, they may not lobby as contracted. Interests hire
   seemingly conflicted lobbyists more often when access is costlier and
   reputational risks are smaller. We examine the hiring of tobacco
   lobbyists by health interests, given the possibilities for shirking and
   reputational damage. We find that institutions such as hospitals hire
   tobacco lobbyists regularly and more often than membership-based health
   groups. Intergroup competition for access and lobby laws, especially
   anti-conflict laws, affect the use of tobacco lobbyists independent of
   rates of multi-client lobbying. Conflicts are more common today than
   ever but interests can protect themselves somewhat from opportunistic
   agents. Our findings also suggest that reforms can improve the
   representation of client interests.},

Journal = {COLOMBIA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {120},

Month = {OCT 9},
Abstract = {Objective/context: By developing an empirical study on the Colombian
   case, this article tests a flexible typology to identify the variants of
   partisanship of 196 ministers, grouped in 91 different cabinets, during
   six governments between 1998 and 2022. The paper also explores the
   factors associated with the strategic decision made by a president
   regarding the degree of partisanship of their cabinet. Methodology: For
   the former, we classified different variants of partisanship based on a
   biographical log, which grades the partisan experience of the ministers
   at the time of appointment. For the latter, we estimated a linear
   regression model, taking the aggregate index of cabinet partisanship as
   the dependent variable. Conclusions: A better identification of the
   ministers who are considered partisan allows for finding a statistically
   significant correlation between the president's image and the cabinet's
   degree of partisanship. Originality: We used an original database
   containing information on 196 ministers.},

Abstract = {Is the hype about ``ecoterrorism{''} analogy, warning or propaganda? In
   order to answer this question, we start by defining radicalization,
   terrorism, and civil disobedience to develop systematic categories which
   allow us to pursue two specific research goals: First, we analyse how
   the breadth of the German climate movement is represented in the media,
   how the issue of ``terrorism{''} is taken up and with what consequences
   for the debate. Here we make a discursive argument. Secondly, we use the
   information provided by the media reports, triangulate it with primary
   data from the movements analysed and secondary data from academic
   publications in order to assess the validity of the accusation of
   terrorism. Here we make a factual argument about the current properties
   of the climate movement. Finally, we bring both arguments together and
   argue that even the more radical currents of climate activism should not
   be classified as terrorists. What we can see is that there has been an
   attempt to criminalize demands of the radical climate movement during
   which large parts of the German print media have become willing
   handmaidens in the delegitimization of more or less radical climate
   groups. More recently, very first signs of a backlash against the
   criminalization can be detected.},

Abstract = {Canada is the world's fourth largest producer of oil and fifth largest
   producer of natural gas. Yet, the country faces a `twin' challenge in
   tackling the climate crisis. On the one hand, Canada's federal climate
   goals state that it must achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. On
   the other hand, regionalism stronghold in fossil-producing provinces
   lead to difficult trade-offs between an ambitious climate transition and
   reluctant actors supporting the fossil fuel industry. This situation is
   characterized as `fossilized' petro-provinces by political scientist
   Angela Carter. This article explores how Alberta, Canada's largest oil
   and natural gas producer, became fossilized. The article develops a path
   dependence argument organized around the role of regionalism in
   Alberta's political development. Regionalism is a crucial persistent
   feature of Alberta to explain its fossilization because it influenced
   the formation of an interdependence between the government and the
   industry, a distinct political culture, and a conservative-led party
   system.},

Abstract = {The historiography of the Durban mass strikes in 1973 has tended to
   focus on the role of white scholars or on the competing accounts of the
   events by different political currents that were active at the time. The
   most astonishing omission in these accounts was that while it is widely
   acknowledged that the textile and clothing workers gave the strikes an
   explosive character, the role of women as prominent actors remains
   invisible. This article will provide evidence and analysis of the
   leadership role in the strikes of women in the textile and clothing
   industry.},

Abstract = {Penalties for corrupt acts are a vital component of integrity management
   systems within bureaucratic organizations, yet systematic inquiry into
   specific interventions is lacking. Drawing from the
   principal-supervisor-agent model, this article explores the criteria for
   imposing penalties on corrupt bureaucrats at the street level. We
   examine the impact of various factors on the severity of penalties for
   corruption, highlighting the influence of top-down anticorruption reform
   and local enforcement capacity. Utilizing text mining techniques, we
   build a comprehensive dataset containing 4025 cases of punishing
   corruption among grassroots officials in China from 2015 to 2023 and use
   multilevel analysis to explore these dynamics. Findings suggest that
   anticorruption reform directly led to an increase in the severity of
   penalties, but with substantial variation across practices. In
   particular, the analysis reveals a positive correlation between
   enforcement capacity and the severity of penalties. Moreover, while the
   relationship between harm and penalty severity represents a
   generalizable observation, significant disparities exist in the
   penalties imposed across various types of corruption. This study
   contributes to understanding the dynamics of multiple punitive measures
   and the factors leading to penalties imposed on corrupt street-level
   bureaucrats.},

Abstract = {While the ``Belt and Road Initiative (BRI){''} infrastructure projects
   bring socio-economic benefits to host countries, they also come with the
   risk of triggering environmental issues within local environmental
   disputes and governance challenges. Utilizing a combination of
   theoretical analysis and case studies, this paper investigates the role
   of the Social License to Operate (SLO) framework in addressing
   environmental conflicts within Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
   infrastructure projects, and how the BRI environmental legal system can
   be utilised to help BRI projects gain SLOs from local residents in terms
   of environmental aspects. The findings propose an integrated governance
   model combining hard and soft law approaches, with specific
   recommendations for achieving this through improved host country
   environmental regulation, international investment agreements and
   oversight responsibilities for Chinese overseas investors, including
   enhanced public participation and improved environmental impact
   assessments.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the military identity of soldiers who deserted from
   the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) and try to make a living in South Africa.
   Because they are deserters they try to hide their military identity, yet
   it is simultaneously somewhat coercively ascribed to them by the Rwandan
   state and can put them in potential danger. The paper attends to the
   constructions, experiences, practices and subjective understanding of
   deserters to examine how, under circumstances of perceived threat, these
   identities are (re)constituted in non-military settings in South Africa
   where the men have become potential political and disciplinary targets.
   Conventional post military literature privileges an understanding of the
   transition of soldiers into civilian life as somewhat unilineal. Little
   is known about the fluidity or rigidity of identities among army
   deserters who are labelled `dissidents' and are being `hunted' by their
   government. We argue that the uncertainty and fear of being discovered
   and harmed produces fluid and multiple identities in Rwandan army
   deserters. At the same time, the ex-soldiers retain military
   dispositions which enable them to navigate real or perceived state
   sponsored surveillance and threat in exile. We assert that military
   identity conjures up a complex state of being in exile due to the
   uncertainties tied to such an identity. We employed life histories,
   in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and deep hang-outs to
   collect data.},

Abstract = {Homeowner associations play a pivotal role in neighbourhood autonomy
   across the globe. However, compared to homeowner associations in Western
   countries, the number of neighbourhood autonomous organizations in
   mainland China, known as owners' committees, has not experienced
   exponential growth in the past twenty years. The study examines the
   election process of owners' committees by analysing a case study of a
   new owners' committee election in X neighbourhood, G city, and aims to
   derive implications for the election of owners' committees, considering
   the distinct challenges they face which include not only the typical
   collective action dilemma experienced by homeowners in Western countries
   and regions but also the need to coordinate and strike a balance between
   state powers and market forces. The findings reveal that the election
   process of the owners' committee achieved full-coverage institutional
   norms by adhering to the guidance of party-building, auditing the
   qualifications of owners, and strengthening public opinion supervision.
   It also realised allround owners' mobilisation through stimulating
   democratic awareness and community consciousness.},

Abstract = {Recent research suggests that college-educated young adults, especially
   those who are politically liberal and/or racially marginalized, exhibit
   moral reservations about their intended occupations. How do they justify
   entering occupations that conflict with their morals, and with what
   consequences? This article examines the case of 74 mostly liberal
   prospective law school students from a range of racial backgrounds
   followed over 2 years. In interviews at career launch, respondents
   criticized the legal profession for its perceived perpetuation of
   inequality and violence. Despite their moral reservations, they
   articulated three occupational justification narratives for attending
   law school: lifting up (exceptional lawyering); leveraging out (legal
   education for nonlawyer aspirations); and leaning in (conscientious
   class mobility/maintenance). These narratives differentiate between
   morally `good' and `bad' occupational domains-a cultural-cognitive
   process we term moral reconciling. We theorize how moral reconciling at
   career launch charts young adults down different early career
   trajectories, with implications for occupational sorting and change.},

Abstract = {For several decades, proponents of aquaculture have framed the industry
   as a critical element of the emerging blue economy. In Ays \& eacute;n,
   Chile, however, environmental crises have undermined the industry's
   claims to sustainability. Invoking ``continuous improvement,{''}
   aquaculture operators manage ecological, economic, and political risks.
   This requires shared understandings of risk and uncertainty in which
   some sources of harm can be mitigated while others are unpredictable
   consequences of environmental variability. Uncertainty therefore becomes
   a corporate social technology for blunting criticism of the industry.
   However, uncertainty also shapes how those overseeing the industry
   perceive their role within Chile's development project.},

Abstract = {Why do people support promoting human rights? Common explanations center
   on the characteristics of states or individuals, particularly ideology.
   In this study, I focus on the role of empathy for outgroups. Contact
   theory suggests that intergroup contact reduces prejudice and increases
   support for outgroup members. I argue that empathy for outgroups
   increases support for defending the rights of foreigners abroad. Testing
   this argument is challenging given selection biases and the potential
   confounding effects of high prejudice and alternative norms. I use
   geocoded public opinion data from 35 African countries to study the
   level of contact with outgroups and its impact on preferences for
   promoting rights overseas. I use the geographic distance to the nearest
   international border and border crossing as a novel measure of contact
   with outgroups and find that the closer an individual is to an
   international land border or an international crossing point, the higher
   their support for preventing human rights abuses in other countries.
   These results are robust to a battery of covariates, robustness checks,
   and model specifications. In addition, the study shows that border
   hardening reduces support for human rights policies, while proximity to
   international borders is not correlated with other potential confounders
   such as concerns about security and migration. Overall, this study
   provides evidence that border zones, despite being the edge of
   sovereignty, generate stakeholders for human rights.},

Title = {Description as the basis for conceptualization and inquiry: studying
   perceptions and practices of citizenship in Tanzania and Kenya},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 28},
Abstract = {This paper argues that description is an important antecedent for
   rigorous conceptualization and asking the right questions. To support
   this argument, it draws on research that takes as its starting point
   description of citizens' perceptions and practices of citizenship in
   rural communities in Tanzania and Kenya, including 724 interviews and 16
   focus groups with ordinary citizens. This paper focusses on the
   descriptive outputs of that research and reflections on the role of
   description throughout the research process. Privileging description of
   citizens' lived experiences and understandings of citizenship was
   central to avoiding the imposition of preexisting conceptualizations of
   citizenship and knowing what questions to ask and how to frame them.
   Rather than relegating description to the ``exploratory{''} phase of
   research, my work demonstrates that continued engagement with
   description as a principal component of multiple stages of research can
   not only ground our research but also improve our explanations of
   political phenomena.},

Abstract = {The article outlines three different rationalities of the interactions
   between the European Union and the Eurasian Economic Union before the
   Russian 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The first rationality
   refers to a neo-Westphalian model of interaction. According to this, the
   EU in its interaction with the EAEU has followed a focus on borders and
   spheres of interest. The second rationality is based on `new
   regionalism', and the interactions between the EU and the EAEU are based
   on economic interdependence. Whereas the first rationality type ignores
   the actorness of the smaller counties in the region, the second
   emphasises it. The final rationality addresses the ideational, normative
   dimensions. The conclusion stresses that the EU in its interaction with
   a non-democratic regional organization ends up in the neo-Westphalian
   interaction logic. The regionalism rationale fails due to the mutual
   exclusiveness of the projects and the EU's normative logic, when
   challenged, turns into hard power.},

Abstract = {Why do authoritarian regimes utilize online subcultures that contradict
   mainstream ideology in their propaganda? This paper argues that
   subcultural discourse is employed by these regimes to persuade younger
   generations to increase their support (persuasion proposition).
   Additionally, it can be used to mobilize supporters to provide favorable
   comments, countering criticism (mobilization proposition). To test these
   theories, a survey experiment with over 2800 respondents in China was
   conducted, supplemented by content analysis of government-run Weibo
   posts from January 2019 to March 2022. The survey experiment supports
   the persuasion proposition, as subculture-oriented propaganda
   strengthens pro-regime attitudes through emotional triggers. However, it
   does not encourage pro-regime behaviors. Content analysis confirms that
   subcultural discourse fails to mobilize a larger number of comments and
   reposts. These findings reveal the impact of subcultural propaganda, a
   relatively new form of propaganda that has gained popularity in recent
   years. This finding indicates that even subculture, which is typically
   seen as subversive and challenging to the regime's authority, can be
   utilized as a tool to reinforce the regime's control.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 25},
Abstract = {Extensive research has been conducted on the influence of ethnicity on
   conflicts. Conversely, research on how conflict affects ethnicity has
   been more limited, tending to indicate that conflicts basically `harden'
   ethnicity. Moreover, existing research suggests that the impact of
   ethnicity is gradually diminishing. This study revealed that these
   arguments are not necessarily true. Reviewing ethnic salience in Sierra
   Leone and Liberia revealed that the post-civil war situation in both
   countries can be considered a reemergence of pre-civil war party
   politics. Hence, civil wars may not invariably exert a significant
   impact on post-conflict party politics, and the impact of ethnicity can
   persist over time.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, the government of the Republic of Korea showed a
   puzzling attitude towards foreign policy signalling. Seoul did not
   demand costly signals from Beijing and Pyongyang to ascertain their
   cooperative intents. Moreover, Seoul showed eagerness to unilaterally
   send the rivals costly signals to convey its intention to cooperate. We
   aim to explain Seoul's engagement in unreciprocated costly signalling
   that diverges from mainstream theoretical expectations. We argue that
   the unreciprocated signalling stemmed from Seoul's belief that Beijing
   and Pyongyang might not know its own cooperative intent, whereas the
   latter two countries' cooperative intents were already sufficiently
   clear to Seoul. Therefore, Seoul reasoned that sending costly signals
   was crucial to convince Beijing and Pyongyang of its trustworthiness
   whereas such signals from the rivals were unnecessary. To support this
   argument, we draw on interviews with senior Republic of Korea officials,
   along with primary and secondary documents available in Korean and
   English.},

Abstract = {This article consists of a detailed survey of the trade regulations
   adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. It
   analyses how trade policymakers have responded to unforeseen
   geopolitical events and how their responses and the scope of these
   measures have differed depending on the nature of the event. Based on
   the International Trade Centre's databases of temporary trade measures,
   we found that 407 COVID-19-related and 189 Ukraine conflict-related
   regulations have been issued since 2020. During the pandemic, temporary
   trade measures were global and comprehensive. They have mostly aimed to
   liberalise the imports and restrict the exports of essential
   commodities. In contrast, temporary measures were enacted mainly on
   specific sectors by the belligerents and their allies during the war in
   Ukraine. They consisted mainly of prohibitions and restrictions of the
   exports and imports of strategic commodities. Some third countries,
   considered as neutral in this war, have also adopted temporary measures
   with global scope to mitigate the sanctions' disruptive effects on their
   own domestic markets.},

Title = {China in Africa: companies as enablers and beneficiaries? An empirical

Abstract = {China's strong economic presence in Africa has resulted in an increased
   interdisciplinary debate. Our contribution is the incorporation of a
   business perspective by uncovering the prominence and role of business
   in China's diplomatic Africa engagement. Our theoretical contribution by
   applying the state-business relations (SBR) literature is to examine
   whether established frameworks can be expanded by an international
   dimension through intergovernmental initiatives like the Forum on
   China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). The paper conducts a document analysis
   of all declarations and Action Plans of all FOCAC conferences in the
   period 2000-2021, combining both a content and a thematic analysis based
   on an explorative and iterative coding process. Our data suggests that
   the prominence of businesses has increased while the scope of their
   activities and the number of focus sectors (especially infrastructure)
   has risen particularly since 2012. Companies are considered as enablers
   for political and economic goals in the state-driven FOCAC. We find that
   SBR frameworks are applicable to international contexts and propose an
   expanded SBR approach integrating transnational intermediary
   institutions like the intergovernmental FOCAC and transnational business
   platforms which facilitate positive state-business relations across
   countries and a conducive business environment.},

   Opportunity structures in anti-corruption multi-stakeholder partnerships},

Abstract = {Information exchange is critical to the functionality of governance
   networks. Traditionally, it has been argued that actors within
   governance networks tend to engage in information exchange with others
   who share similar beliefs and motivations, as these are deemed catalysts
   for achieving collective objectives. An alternative viewpoint posits
   that actors may prioritize strategies aimed at minimizing transaction
   costs and maximizing returns when selecting their partners. This paper
   proposes that information exchange predominantly occurs with partners
   who are easily accessible (i.e., where transaction costs are low) and
   with partners who are perceived as influential (i.e., where benefits are
   high). To investigate these alternative propositions, we examine three
   distinct opportunity structures that actors may utilize, which are based
   on their preferences for (1) partners with similar participatory
   motivations, (2) partners who co-participate in institutional
   committees, and (3) those perceived as influential. We empirically test
   these opportunity structures using unique survey data gathered from 10
   anti-corruption multi-stakeholder partnerships within the public
   infrastructure domain in countries of Latin America, Africa, and
   Eurasia. Results from Exponential Random Graph Models suggest that
   shared participatory motivations do not significantly impact information
   exchange within our context, whereas the perceived influence of a
   partner emerges as a critical predictor. In addition, co-participation
   in institutional committees significantly facilitates information
   dissemination, particularly when those committees involve discussions on
   deliberating about strategies to communicate findings on public-sector
   infrastructure discrepancies and formulating recommendations to
   governments on transparency and accountability. These findings prompt
   discussions on four network management strategies aimed at restructuring
   networks and fostering stakeholder involvement and inclusivity.},

Abstract = {This article examines Indonesia's position during the Russia-Ukraine
   war, highlighting the tension between its traditional foreign policy
   principles and pragmatic approach to international conflicts.
   Indonesia's support for UN resolutions condemning Russia, compared with
   its avoidance of directly naming Russia as the aggressor, reveals an
   ambivalence rooted in the paradox of upholding equal sovereignty norms
   while promoting a `familial' approach to conflict resolution. This
   paradox is evident in Indonesia's simultaneous support for Ukraine's
   territorial integrity while calling for peace negotiations, which
   equates the aggressor with the victim. The study explores the historical
   context of Indonesia's foreign policy, emphasizing sovereign equality
   and non-alignment, and how these principles are challenged by the
   current geopolitical landscape. Through qualitative content analysis of
   official statements, public opinion and media narratives, the article
   argues that Indonesia's ambivalence in the Russia-Ukraine war reflects a
   tension between its normative commitments to sovereignty and pragmatic
   needs to peacefully end conflict.},

Abstract = {This case study article delves into the comprehensive governance
   strategies employed by Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic, as
   elucidated in a compelling speech delivered by Mr. Zainul Abidin Rasheed
   at Lien Development Conference 2022. The former Senior Minister of State
   (Foreign Affairs) and Member of the Board of Trustees at Nanyang
   Technological University sheds light on the triumvirate of key
   elements-capacity, collaboration and cohesion-that underscore
   Singapore's successful management of the crisis. The article explores
   the multifaceted state capacities meticulously developed over time,
   highlighting the instrumental role of public-private partnerships in
   fostering collaborative innovation. Anchoring these strategies is
   societal cohesion, intricately woven with political trust, effective
   communication and a shared spirit of mutual support. As Mr. Rasheed
   contemplates the open question of whether humanity has gleaned the
   necessary lessons from history to adequately prepare for the future, he
   envisions Singapore's experience serving as a valuable reference for
   others.},

Abstract = {The rise of smart cities has raised innovative ideas on public designs
   that provide opportunities for community building. Despite extant
   academic conversations discussing community formation and community
   management through urban design, there is a lack of literature on the
   role of the public sector in community building and redevelopment of
   spaces for the local community. This research aims to gain a better
   understanding of the importance of how local governments in various
   countries create and operate public facilities that are intended to
   allow residents to exchange ideas, learn, and have fun, and how they
   also pay attention to the esthetics and design of their surroundings to
   create comfortable spaces for the people. Examining through the
   perspectives of city design, political science, and urban sociology, and
   considering the impact that COVID-19 had on the use of these spaces,
   this research proposes a benchmark for community building through urban
   design and analyzes in detail case studies from four different cities:
   Sapporo, Helsinki, Sao Paulo, and Singapore. Findings from our proposed
   benchmark contribute to the theory, and inform public stakeholders and
   local government to create, activate, and manage current and future
   public spaces to better serve the residents and attract new residents.},

Title = {A theory on political violence in hybrid regimes: insights from Colombia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Month = {AUG 29},
Abstract = {Introduction This article presents a model of political competition in
   which political parties, through clientelism strategies, vie for control
   of legislative seats. Parties exercise political violence to prevent
   potential rivals from gaining power and threatening their position
   within the hybrid political regime. The theory suggests that the degree
   of political violence exerted by parties in hybrid regimes will increase
   (decrease) as they concentrate more (less) power in the
   legislature.Methods Using the methodology of analytical narratives, we
   examine the narrative on political violence in the Colombian political
   regime to identify key actors, strategies, information sets, and
   institutional changes. From these identified elements, we construct a
   theoretical model of political competition within the mathematical
   theory of games to explain the institutional changes highlighted in the
   narrative. Finally, we develop an econometric model to find statistical
   evidence supporting the predictions of the theoretical model derived
   from the narrative.Results The narrative and the analytical narrative
   indicate that, in a hybrid regime, a higher degree of political power
   concentration causes a higher rate of political violence. The estimation
   of the Vector Auto-regression model allows us to analyze the response of
   the violence rate to a shock in the concentration index. Following an
   unexpected increase in the concentration of political power, the
   violence rate shows an initial increase of approximately 0.3 percentage
   points above its initial value. Subsequently, the effect attenuates
   slightly and stabilizes at around 0.2 percentage points above the
   baseline, maintaining this level throughout the
   period.Discussion/Conclusion The theoretical model proposed in this
   paper suggests an explanation of political violence that diverges from
   the explanations offered by traditional theories. We suggest that the
   theoretical model proposed here captures the historical logic of the
   relationship between violence, political clientelism, and exclusion in
   Colombia, a country with a relatively long tradition as a formal
   democracy (since 1958), leading us to interesting conclusions that have
   not been proposed so far in the literature on violence in Latin America.},

Abstract = {Civil war can change the narratives of a collective Self and damage some
   of its ontological security conditions, such as continuity, self-esteem,
   and consistency. Using a qualitative analysis of the Facebook pages
   visited widely by the residents of Salamieh City in Syria (a stronghold
   for Ismailis), this study shows how narratives of a collective Self
   (both local Salamieh and national Syrian Selves) have been generated to
   cope with threats to ontological security imposed by the ongoing civil
   war. Following our finding that the pro-regime and neutral pages could
   have used thin narratives of ontological security but instead sticked to
   thick narratives, we argue that thick narrative opens up possibilities
   to understand complex reality and generate a rich meaning-system and
   strong agency. Contrary to the claim that a simple Self is more
   ontologically secure because its narrative is easily kept continuous and
   routinized, this study shows that confronting reality and tolerating
   change through thick narratives despite the anxiety and pain the process
   generates, can provide ontological security in the future.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {This article adopts a Durkheimian perspective and employs a
   socio-pragmatic method of inquiry, with a specific focus on analyzing
   ``scandals{''} as critical junctures and the interpretations provided by
   social actors. The aim is to explore the development of corruption as a
   social issue in Romania over the past four decades. In contrast to two
   prevailing explanatory approaches in Romania, labeled here as fatalistic
   and voluntarist, we propose a more reflective approach. This perspective
   illustrates how the increasing division of labor and the subsequent rise
   in individualization within social relations have progressively
   influenced the tendencies and sensitivities of various social groups in
   Romanian society, particularly regarding what this study refers to as
   ``illegal personal enrichment{''} (IPE). By focusing on discourse
   analysis of debates on corruption, this study analyses the evolution of
   the politicization of corruption-a subject still largely unexplored but
   highly prevalent in the public sphere-in conjunction with the structural
   changes in Romanian society. Consequently, three stages can be
   identified: IPE as a discursive tool for denouncing political
   adversaries, IEP as a generator of political conflicts, and IEP as a
   public issue.},

Abstract = {Behavioral public administration research has provided empirical
   evidence of several perception biases when individuals process
   information. Building on these findings, we seek to advance the
   literature by analyzing politicians' financial perceptions of their own
   government. Drawing on the theory of motivated reasoning, we examine the
   context of Swedish municipalities and find financial perception gaps
   associated with politicians' party affiliation (establishment or
   anti-establishment), parliamentary position (opposition or governing
   party), and formal hierarchical rank. Specifically, politicians
   representing anti-establishment and opposition parties, as well as those
   occupying lower positions in the political hierarchy-and thus having
   less influence over and less responsibility for municipal affairs-tend
   to perceive the financial situation more negatively. These findings
   suggest the presence of a motivationally driven bias in politicians'
   perceptions of financial conditions; moreover, they illustrate that
   these perceptions are influenced by factors beyond the traditional
   financial, socioeconomic, and demographic ones examined in previous
   research.},

Abstract = {There is considerable investment by government policymakers in
   supporting pilot innovation in public services, following which pilots
   prove difficult to sustain. Our 4-year longitudinal study of three pilot
   innovations in England, which seek to support the transition of care
   leavers into adulthood, provides insight into how such pilots can be
   sustained. Conceiving innovation as a journey, our study first
   identifies the dynamics of innovation around five key ingredients: the
   role of senior managers in cultivating a receptive context for
   innovation, distributed leadership, user co-production, measurement of
   outcomes, and innovation adaption. Second, our study highlights some
   ingredients are more important as implementation of innovation is
   initiated and may fade in importance as the innovation journey proceeds.
   Third, our study shows innovation ingredients are shaped by
   organizational contingencies of performance and financial pressures.
   Finally, we suggest a need for a contextualized implementation science
   framework to examine innovation in social care.},

Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 8},
Abstract = {Various factors have been found to contribute to an individual's pathway
   to Islamist radicalization. Signs of psychiatric disorders and
   psychological problems have been reported to be one of them. While
   European women have supported and joined the Islamic State (IS), their
   psychopathologies have rarely been systematically recorded. We set out
   to review the literature on psychopathologies among European women
   involved in Islamist radicalization. Out of the seven included studies,
   two reported psychiatric diagnoses in line with official diagnosis
   systems. Three studies indicated that they were official psychiatric
   diagnoses among the sample, without specifying the diagnosis at hand.
   Psychological problems at the subclinical level were reported among
   three studies. Psychological familial control and a resulting lack of
   autonomy during adolescence was reported in three studies. Experienced
   trauma in the childhood and/or adolescence was reported in four studies.
   The current review highlights the need for well-designed empirical
   studies on existing psychopathologies among European women involved in
   Islamist radicalization. Future studies reporting on female-specific
   psychiatric disorders and psychological problems while using
   standardized psychiatric assessment making them comparable to each other
   are urgently needed.},

Abstract = {The implementation work of street-level bureaucrats (SLBs) is becoming
   more complex due to concurrent imperatives. While previous research has
   focused on SLBs' discretion decisions and coping strategies, this study
   adds to existing literature by suggesting that their perceptions of
   ``the job{''} are changing. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 87 US
   police officers, we found that SLBs are influenced by the great emphasis
   on public value, understanding their job in terms of assuming general
   responsibility for citizens, as public representatives. They adopt
   various strategies to respond to citizens' needs, providing a vast range
   of services that deviate from their traditional job. We conclude that
   SLBs work constantly, formally and informally, to effectively address
   what is good for the public, in ways that go beyond their professional
   particularities. We argue that such a broader perspective requires
   public administration scholars to consider more critically the expanded
   job perceptions, manifested in expanded professional responsibility.},

Title = {The EU's Normative Dissensus on Migration: How National Identities

Abstract = {During the so-called European refugee crisis of 2015-16, a `normative
   dissensus' emerged between the EU member states located at the end of
   the Balkan route, Germany, Hungary, and Austria. This paper explores the
   roots of this normative dissensus by operationalizing post-functionalist
   propositions. It posits that national identity, and its domestic
   politicization during the late summer of 2015 generated the
   `constraining normative dissensus' during the refugee crisis. To
   operationalize the link between identity, domestic politicization, and
   European dissensus, we employ moral-philosopher Christine Korsgaard's
   concepts of `self-constitution' and `practical identity'. We then apply
   this normative-constructivist approach to empirically demonstrate how
   the diversely constituted national identities of Germany, Austria, and
   Hungary led to different foundations for moral argumentation during the
   refugee crisis. As for the European integration process more generally,
   our findings highlight the importance of a shared European identity to
   achieve a normative consensus in areas that touch upon migration and
   citizenship.},

   Analysis of a Harm Reduction and Prevention},
Journal = {RIVISTA ITALIANA DI POLITICHE PUBBLICHE},
Year = {2024},
Number = {2},
Pages = {245-272},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The scientific debate on street-level bureaucrats (SLBs) has explored
   elements such as resources, policy capacities, entrepreneurship, and
   digital innovation, but paid little attention to the relational
   dimension between SLBs and citizens, and how this affects policy
   outcomes. Through the analysis of a policy for gambling prevention and
   harm reduction the article aims to identify which relational factors
   affected the policy outcomes. Data collection, based on semi-structured
   interviews and participant observation in three gaming venues, allowed
   authors to reconstruct in depth three cases of relation between
   bureaucrats and citizens. Based on these cases, the article indicates
   how certain relational factors, such as third-party mediation,
   intermittency in the relationship, communicative distancing, and
   attempts to cross a psychological threshold, can determine substantial
   differences in terms of policy outcomes.},

Title = {Does (dis)agreement reflect beliefs? An analysis of advocacy coalitions
   in Swiss pesticide policy},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLICY ANALYSIS},

Abstract = {Agricultural pesticide use is a wicked sustainability challenge:
   Trade-offs exist between health, environmental, agro-economic, and
   socio-political objectives. Various actors involved have diverse beliefs
   regarding these trade-offs and policies to address the challenge. But to
   what extent does the agreement or disagreement between actors reflect
   belief similarities or differences, and thus, the formation of advocacy
   coalitions? To answer this question, the study draws on the advocacy
   coalition framework and investigates data from 54 key actors in the case
   of Swiss pesticide policy. The study explores the relationship between
   the actors' (dis)agreement relations and their beliefs using Random
   Forests. Coalitions are identified through block modeling and beliefs
   based on multi-attribute value theory. The study shows that the two
   relations are a good proxy for identifying coalitions with conflict
   lines concerning beliefs and presents an approach to exploring
   ideological reasons behind (dis)agreement relations that supports
   identifying conflicting beliefs relevant to future policy solutions.},

Abstract = {Economic effects on environmental concerns assess macroeconomic
   pressures or microeconomic status differences but overlook environmental
   and labor scholarly attention to industry contexts. I test whether
   employed industry, green jobs opportunities, and regulatory threats
   influence five environmental concern indexes using cross-sectional US
   General Social Surveys from 2000, 2010, and 2021 and federal
   administrative data. Findings indicate individuals employed in resource
   extraction, construction, and manufacturing express less environmental
   concerns than service sector individuals but vary across dimensions.
   Resource extraction individuals express less concern for environmental
   protections and pollution harms. Manufacturing, construction and
   utilities individuals are less willing to sacrifice for the environment.
   Green jobs sub-industry employment is positively associated with more
   willingness to sacrifice and empowerment to act for the environment.
   Surprisingly, employment in Environmental Protection Agency regulated
   sub-industries is positively associated with more willingness to
   sacrifice for the environment. The findings underscore future research
   on how industry-based economic contexts shape environmental concerns.},

Abstract = {(Ouverture) By making the case for opera houses as symbols of civilized
   status in International Relations (IR), this article addresses the
   discrepancy between the waning popularity of opera and the veritable
   boom in new opera houses we are witnessing across the globe. We
   foreground the multivocality of status symbols-they may be intended to
   communicate more than one meaning, by and to more than one audience.
   Whether intended as vehicles of urban, regional, or national status
   ambitions, building opera houses has signaled civilizational
   achievements. After a brief exploration of status symbols, we explore
   opera houses in general, before turning to a more in-depth study of the
   recent Oslo Opera House. Through the empirical study we show how opera
   houses have been (and still are) complex status symbols, with multiple
   internal and external dimensions, straddling the line between getting
   other states to sing along or serving mainly for purposes of singing
   alone. Finally, we posit that the current international boom in opera
   houses is a testimony to the enduring importance of being perceived as
   civilized in IR-long after the standard of civilization has ceased to be
   explicitly applied.},

Abstract = {In former enclaves of the India-Bangladesh borderlands, trans-local
   interactions evinced adaptations in response to recurrent shifts in
   their categorical and experiential peripheralities. This case study of
   Chhit Sheupara assesses the disconnect in its categorizations as a
   `stateless' space through an exploration of local negotiations to bypass
   its ascriptive isolations. The study analyses proxy-citizenship and
   limited governance as configurations of Sheupara's adaptive resilience,
   as a part of local efforts to subvert and circumvent their erstwhile
   stateless existence within a dynamic borderland locale through
   reproductions of normativity and instrumentalities of state civicism.},

Abstract = {After decades of leftist quiescence in Croatia, new social movements
   have created viable political alternatives. This paper analyses the New
   Left's electoral support using 2021 survey data. The findings show
   greater support from younger, urban, and culturally liberal individuals,
   who do not favour increased state market intervention. While some New
   Left factions support neoliberal policies, this stance must be viewed in
   the context of high corruption in Croatia, as New Left voters care about
   socio-economic inequality. These findings align with recent qualitative
   studies, suggesting further research into the links between corruption,
   individual attitudes, and support for the New Left.},

   limited to western Europe, mainly use twentieth-century data and do not
   control for domestic determinants of tax policy. I therefore study the
   determinants of tax mix composition and convergence in a panel of 30 EU
   and OECD countries between 1980 and 2019 using linear regressions. I
   find that tax mixes converge and shift from personal income taxes
   towards more regressive revenue sources. Contrary to theoretical
   predictions, both observations are almost unrelated to proxies of tax
   competition. Instead, the main driving factor is EU membership. Tax
   mixes of Central and Eastern European member states, however, do not
   Europeanise: they constitute a distinct group with low and persistently
   regressive taxation.},

Abstract = {The number of fortified borders around the world has risen
   precipitously. This surge in walls is an important part of the larger
   globalization ``backlash,{''} as countries react to the unwanted
   consequences of economic openness and globalization, with a rise in
   illicit trade and smuggling being a prominent example. Despite the
   prominence of the idea that walls are built to combat illicit flows, no
   research systematically explores how walls generally affect illicit
   trade. This is a notable omission for at least two reasons. First, the
   most prominent explanations for wall construction put combating illicit
   trade front and center. Second, recent work that finds walls
   significantly reduce legal trade argues that this finding derives from
   border fortifications diverting illegal trade to ports of entry, which
   leads to more inspection, security, and transaction costs. We develop a
   new measure of illicit trade flows using over five decades of
   product-level data and provide a battery of evidence that shows border
   barriers increase illicit flows at ports of entry.
   La cantidad de fronteras fortificadas existentes en todo el mundo ha
   aumentado vertiginosamente. Este aumento de los muros es una parte
   importante de la ``repercusi \& oacute;n{''} m \& aacute;s amplia que ha
   tenido la globalizaci \& oacute;n, ya que los pa \& iacute;ses
   reaccionan a las consecuencias no deseadas de la apertura econ \&
   oacute;mica y de la globalizaci \& oacute;n, siendo un ejemplo destacado
   de esto el aumento del comercio il \& iacute;cito y del contrabando. A
   pesar de la importancia que se atribuye a la idea de que los muros se
   construyen para combatir los flujos il \& iacute;citos, no existe
   ninguna investigaci \& oacute;n que estudie de forma sistem \&
   aacute;tica c \& oacute;mo los muros afectan, en general, al comercio il
   \& iacute;cito. Esta omisi \& oacute;n resulta notable por, al menos,
   dos razones. En primer lugar, las explicaciones m \& aacute;s destacadas
   para la construcci \& oacute;n de los muros tienden a poner en primer
   plano la lucha contra el comercio il \& iacute;cito. En segundo lugar,
   existen trabajos recientes que concluyen que los muros reducen
   significativamente el comercio legal. Estos trabajos argumentan que esto
   se debe a que las fortificaciones fronterizas desv \& iacute;an el
   comercio ilegal a los puertos de entrada, lo que conduce a m \& aacute;s
   costes de inspecci \& oacute;n, seguridad y transacci \& oacute;n.
   Desarrollamos una nueva forma de medici \& oacute;n de los flujos de
   comercio il \& iacute;cito, utilizando para ello m \& aacute;s de cinco
   d \& eacute;cadas de datos a nivel de productos y proporcionamos una
   bater \& iacute;a de pruebas que muestran que las barreras fronterizas
   aumentan los flujos il \& iacute;citos en los puertos de entrada.
   Le nombre de fronti \& egrave;res fortifi \& eacute;es dans le monde
   s'est envol \& eacute;. Cette multiplication de murs est un \& eacute;l

   exemple. Bien que l'\& eacute;rection de murs soit largement consid \&
   eacute;r \& eacute;e comme une r \& eacute;ponse aux flux ill \&
   eacute;gaux, aucun travail de recherche n'analyse syst \&
   eacute;matiquement les effets g \& eacute;n \& eacute;raux des murs sur

   eacute;orientation des \& eacute;changes illicites vers les ports d'entr

Abstract = {Following Russia's invasion, Ukraine exemplifies presidential leadership
   during full-scale war. This study examines executive coordination from
   Zelenskyi's mid-2019 election to the February 2022-July 2023 war period,
   using media sources and official data. It introduces three new
   leadership models - figurehead-leader, arbiter-management and
   leader-implementer - to capture evolving intra-executive relations in
   semi-presidential systems. Power centralisation around the president has
   accelerated, fitting the leader-implementer model. However, in
   accordance with the arbiter-manager model, a stricter division of
   labour, especially in domestic policy, is evident. Despite
   semi-presidentialism's perceived conflict-proneness, the study shows it
   can function efficiently and allow executive flexibility during
   significant crisis.},

Abstract = {This article examines the problem of recent UK public inquiries into
   military controversies both in general (the waging of war) and
   particular (individual killings). It first sets out their potential and
   actual value as well as the critiques that threaten their legitimacy.
   Arguing that the benefits of the process make the public inquiry worthy
   as an apt intra-state device for uncovering unlawful military violence,
   revealing the `truth' of a matter, apportioning responsibility and
   changing practices, it then asks whether or how this promise might be
   better fulfilled by addressing some of its identified conceptual and
   practical flaws? The article then focuses on the epistemic dimension,
   arguing that if public inquiry is to serve as a valid truth-seeking
   mechanism, it will first need to address not only the identification of
   what and whose knowledge should be sought through inquiry (the general
   epistemic question), but also the way in which that knowledge is to be
   found and presented (the zetetic question). Without attending to both
   matters, reforming the current statutory framework of the Inquiries Act
   2005, public inquiry into military wrongs is likely to disappoint as an
   independent, impartial and inclusive process that fails to satisfy basic
   accountability norms.},

Abstract = {My first book, in many ways a lonely project at the time, is now part of
   a steadily growing body of comparative-historical scholarship in the
   social sciences. Studying socio-political changes of all kinds -
   including today's democratic backsliding in the United States and beyond
   - is best done, as States and Social Revolutions helped to demonstrate,
   by probing and juxtaposing fully contextualised cases. It still makes
   sense for scholars to (directly or implicitly) compare historical
   trajectories, tease out the intersections of social inequalities and
   struggles over state power, and address the evolving global contexts as
   in local, regional, or national episodes play out. This way of studying
   political conflict and change is what I believe endures from States and
   Social Revolutions, as new generations of scholars go far beyond the
   arguments of that book born decades ago.},

Abstract = {This article speaks to an established interest of International
   Relations scholars in the construction of the `China threat' in US
   political discourse. We advance recent works which have argued that the
   rise of China has contributed to the success of populism in the United
   States and Western liberal democracies more widely. Specifically, we
   transpose the concept of the `populism of the privileged' to the
   international realm to understand how narratives of status loss nurture
   perceptions of collective trauma and victimhood. We argue that the
   concept helps explain why Trump's anti-China populism is centred on the
   counterintuitive articulation of an American underdog identity at the
   domestic and international levels. It sheds light on why populist
   narratives of unjust suffering have grip even if supporters stem from
   comparatively privileged groups. Victimhood-centric narratives are
   always relational and, as we show, the imaginary of lost status is a
   powerful device in the populist toolbox.},

Abstract = {Russian intelligence failed President Vladimir Putin in supporting the
   most consequential decision of statecraft - war - before Russia's 2022
   (re)invasion of Ukraine but has since somewhat recovered, possibly
   redeeming itself in Putin's estimation by securing his regime nearly two
   and a half years since his shambolic invasion. This article complements
   our previous article in this journal, The Autocrat's Intelligence
   Paradox: Vladimir Putin's (mis)management of Russian strategic
   assessment in the Ukraine War, which examined the systemic roots of
   Russia's intelligence failure in early 2022. In this follow-on article
   exploring Russian intelligence's traditional areas of (relative)
   competence in the period following the full-scale invasion, we consider
   the categories of espionage, sanctions evasion, active measures, and
   repression, and conclude that Putin's security and intelligence organs
   have reasserted themselves with terrible vigour, domestically and
   internationally. Despite notable failings - and some flaps - they have
   been indispensable to Putin by securing his regime, at least through
   mid-2024.},

Abstract = {How do political parties in the European Union (EU) react to
   disintegration bids from a member state? This question is important, as
   scholars have argued that framing by elites (particularly Eurosceptic
   entrepreneurs) is crucial in shaping whether disintegration is seen as
   an example to follow or one to avoid. This article investigates how
   parties outside the UK reacted to Brexit, and argues that Eurosceptic
   challenger parties and mainstream pro-European parties altered their
   stances after the referendum vote in June 2016. I use a combination of
   automated and hand-coded methods to identify and analyse 2223 Brexit
   statements in the parliaments of five member states between 2013 and
   2018. I show how after the referendum vote, challenger parties avoid
   Brexit and significantly moderate the Euroscepticism in their Brexit
   statements. By contrast mainstream parties emphasise Brexit and
   significantly increase the pro-Europeanism in their Brexit statements.
   Results show that in the short term at least, there is little evidence
   of Eurosceptic entrepreneurs framing Brexit as a positive precedent or
   example to follow.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},

Abstract = {Our paper argues that Agent Based Modelling (ABM) can play an important
   role in evaluating interventions for counter radicalization and
   recruitment. Its advantages are due to three realities of research and
   practice in this area of study. First, field research on radicalization
   and recruitment raises significant ethical and human subjects dilemmas
   beyond traditional criminological and social research that are not
   present to the same degree in ABM experiments. Second, given the lack of
   existing studies and especially existing evaluation studies, ABMs
   provide a mechanism for identifying which programs or practices should
   be focused upon in field experiments, thus allowing researchers to focus
   in on interventions which have most promise of success. Third, ABM
   allows researchers to examine very large populations of individuals,
   which can solve the base rate problem for evaluating interventions
   focused on rare events, for example on recruitment to terrorism or
   terrorist attacks. We illustrate these advantages of ABM studies for
   assessing programs and policies in the context of an ABM model developed
   in Proton (an Horizon 2020 project). We focus in particular on how ABMs
   can be developed in ways that provide valid outcome results. In this
   context, we emphasize the importance of a strong theoretical foundation
   for ABM studies, creating a realistic landscape with actual data, and
   testing the ABM model for its fit to outcomes in the real world.},

Abstract = {This article addresses three caveats in populist radical right (PRR)
   voter studies focusing on gender and sexuality: omission of potential
   voters, representing gender and sexuality as one undifferentiated
   category, and issue-specific rather than comparative analysis. We use a
   theory-grounded latent class analysis, based on the Dutch Parliamentary
   Election Study (2021), to identify voter profiles in terms of how
   nativism, populism, and gender identity and sexuality attitudes combine
   differently among citizens who are inclined to vote populist radical
   right. Empirically, we find distinct profiles in terms of populism,
   nativism and gender identity and sexuality attitudes: a small minority
   of gender-and-sexuality-conservatives and larger classes of more modern
   and moderate potential populist radical right voters; but all clearly
   nativist. Abstracting from the specific case of the Netherlands, we
   provide typological descriptions of populist radical right voters that
   are likely also relevant in other countries.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates how presentations of self and the information
   conveyed within them are a conduit for risk evaluation within the
   marketplace. Using the case of check cashing, it investigates customer
   screening within the Detroit area's most prevalent non-bank check
   cashing businesses, which are not standalone check cashing outlets but
   rather corner convenience and liquor stores known as `party stores'.
   Without algorithmic techniques based on hard or quantitative data, how
   do owners screen customers to prevent fraud? Drawing on 35 months of
   ethnographic fieldwork, this article uncovers two strategies toward this
   end: (a) gathering private information about customers through small
   talk; and (b) assessing check cashers' presentations of self. Analyzing
   check cashing and fraud in this setting speaks to theoretical
   perspectives of risk evaluation by presenting a case of interactional
   fraud prevention, which highlights the interpersonal, interactional
   mechanisms through which soft information is exchanged and assessed in
   ex ante screening.},

Title = {Alterity-space: national spatiality in Lasnamäe, Estonia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {This research investigates the relationship between the city and the
   state in framing the national belonging of space as arenas of inclusion
   and difference within the nation. It is argued that bringing Isin and
   Lefebvre into dialogue allows for a genealogical analysis of space as a
   social product imbued in and constituted by narratives of national
   inclusion (or exclusion). This research develops the concept of
   alterity-space as a distinct spatial category in which the constitution
   of citizenship is inscribed on socially produced space. This
   alterity-space refers to categories of difference as an internal other
   of space at odds with the space of the nation. Alterity-space as a
   concept invites reflection on how state engagement, competing
   symbolisms, narratives, and interactions produce spatiality and create
   mechanisms of othering that obscure other articulations of national
   belonging in space. This approach is illustrated through a genealogical
   examination of Lasnam \& auml;e, an urban district at the heart of
   Estonia's capital. In the constitution of national, ecological, digital,
   and European identities, Lasnam \& auml;e is positioned as an
   alterity-space to Tallinn and Estonia. This positioning reflects how
   space itself becomes imbued as an immediate other at odds with Estonia's
   past and future of national belonging.},

Abstract = {Since the adoption of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the
   order founded on the treaty has evolved into an increasingly fragmented
   regime complex. Fragmentation has resulted from forum-shifting initiated
   both at the top and at the bottom of the nuclear hierarchy: both the
   United States, with varying partners, and coalitions of small-and
   medium-sized non-nuclear states have repeatedly moved rule-making on
   nuclear issues to fora outside the NPT, adding partly conflicting
   institutions to the complex. To understand this dynamic, I propose a
   sociological perspective that highlights states' positional struggles in
   a multidimensionally stratified international society. Drawing on
   Bourdieusian global fields theory, I argue that both dominant and weak
   states use forum-shifting to manipulate exchange rates between different
   (material, institutional and social) forms of capital they possess.
   Thus, they seek to protect their positions in global hierarchies within
   and beyond the nuclear field when they perceive these hierarchies as
   being challenged by material or institutional power shifts.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the relationship between public funding and
   the political activities of youth organisations in Europe. By analysing
   original data from a random sample of about 4500 youth organisations in
   nine countries generated through a content analysis of organisations'
   websites, we examine the extent to which they engage in political
   activities. The analysis provides evidence for a negative impact of
   public funding on the engagement of youth organisations in political
   activities. This suggests that receiving financial resources from state
   institutions may lead to depoliticisation. Moreover, we also show how
   the effect of public funding is conditional upon the broader context,
   suggesting that the question of whether public funding encourages or
   discourages youth organisations to carry out political activities may be
   contingent on their broader economic and political environment.},

Abstract = {Are bureaucrats' interactions with politicians, as well as with other
   government and non-government players in the policy arena, linked with
   the bureaucrats' policy entrepreneurship tendencies? To investigate this
   question, we sought to identify the factors influencing bureaucrats'
   willingness to engage in policy entrepreneurship. We also explored the
   bureaucrats' motivations for doing so in order to better understand if
   policy entrepreneurship among bureaucrats is a desirable phenomenon.
   Using national survey data from Brazil, our findings indicate that
   politician-bureaucrat interactions have a positive relationship with
   bureaucrats' perceptions about policy entrepreneurship. In addition,
   there is a positive association between bureaucrats' motivations for
   engaging in policy entrepreneurship and their social values.},

Abstract = {When does the delegation of legislative powers to the executive endanger
   policy compliance? The European Union (EU) Lisbon Treaty introduced
   quasi-legislative tertiary legislation - delegated acts - which empowers
   the European Commission to amend secondary legislation. Formally, member
   states control delegated acts only ex post via a veto power in the
   Council, while they have both ex ante amendment powers and ex post veto
   over the alternative Commission legislation: implementing acts. However,
   as member states determine the choice of legislative instrument, we
   argue that they would consent to the Commission adopting delegated acts
   only on non-controversial issues. Such selection should result in their
   lower compliance with implementing than with delegated acts. Our
   analyses of member states' transposition delays and infringement cases
   related to EU tertiary directives support this argument. The results
   suggest that the delegation of legislative powers to the executive does
   not increase non-compliance when the legislators have the means to
   moderate it ex ante.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},

Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {343-355},
Month = {APR 2},
Abstract = {The emergence of critical policy studies networks is evident in the
   proliferation of network-building efforts. These coincide with the rise
   of epistemic communities and sub-communities through existing, active
   platforms and interactive exchanges. Based on participatory
   observations, content analysis, and discussions with key informants,
   this article seeks to map out the range of established networks that
   have been formed for critical and interpretive orientation in policy
   studies. The article unpacks the platforms, activities, and key focuses
   exhibited by these networks; and after that, analyzes both their common
   grounds and differences. Emerging with one another together, these
   networks encourage and produce critical and interpretive approaches,
   albeit with differing shades in how they approach knowledge. The
   significance of these networks will largely depend on which kinds, or
   shades, of knowledge become salient. There is a prospect of establishing
   connections among critical policy studies networks as they share among
   one another in developing these interconnections. The purpose of this
   article effort is to offer a map to inquirers in order to help them
   better orient themselves to their task, which is not simply further
   mapping, but also includes furthering the development of critical policy
   studies networks.},

Title = {Agricultural adaptation strategies under Morales's administration: The
   Case of a Guarni Community in the Bolivian Chaco},

Abstract = {In Bolivia, the Morales administration promoted agricultural projects in
   Guarani communities with the purpose of enhancing climate resilience and
   strengthening the communities' production capacities and systems. Though
   aligned with the government's broader goal of decolonizing Indigenous
   realities, this objective proved questionable in the light of the
   government's neoextractivist development model. Scholars have shown that
   the enhancement of climate resilience in Bolivia faces significant
   difficulties due to socio-structural barriers. A study of one local
   project based on ethnographic fieldwork between 2015 and 2016 in a
   Guarani community reveals that the limits of the decolonial horizon of
   radical pluridiversity in the MAS political project are key to
   understanding some of those difficulties. Rooted in the One World World
   paradigm (the dominant narrative of reality), the project reenacted a
   socio-ecological order that constrained Indigenous ways of life and
   agriculture and, therefore, the foundations on which Guarani climate
   resilience has historically rested.En Bolivia, el gobierno de Morales
   promovio proyectos agricolas en comunidades guaranies con el proposito
   de mejorar la resiliencia climatica y fortalecer las capacidades y
   sistemas de produccion de las comunidades, lo que estaba alineado con el
   objetivo mas amplio del gobierno de descolonizar las realidades
   indigenas. Sin embargo, la descolonizacion y emancipacion de los
   proyectos de vida indigena han sido cuestionadas a la luz del modelo de
   desarrollo neoextractivista del gobierno. Se ha demostrado que la mejora
   de la resiliencia climatica enfrenta dificultades significativas debido
   a barreras socio-estructurales. El estudio de un proyecto local basado
   en el trabajo de campo etnografico realizado entre 2015 y 2016 en una
   comunidad guarani revela que los limites del horizonte decolonial de la
   pluridiversidad radical, en el proyecto politico del MAS son clave para
   entender algunas de esas dificultades. Enraizado en el paradigma del
   Mundo unico (narrative dominante sobre la realidad), el proyecto recreo
   un orden socio-ecologico que limita las formas de vida y las
   agriculturas indigenas y, por lo tanto, los cimientos sobre los que
   historicamente se ha basado su resiliencia climatica.},

Abstract = {I examine the effect of the policing capacity of traditional authorities
   (TAs) on communal conflict. TAs of ethnic groups use distinct customary
   laws and dispute-resolution mechanisms. Their coexistence with national
   norms and those of other TAs results in parallel legal systems. I argue
   that this generates uncertainties about norms and vertical and
   horizontal jurisdictional conflict, which increases the risk of communal
   conflict. However, this effect can be dampened by state-level rules on
   norm collisions, which lead to a system of co-production and less
   violence. To investigate these claims, I use global georeferenced expert
   survey data on customary policing of TAs and data measuring their
   constitutional regulation. I show that customary policing can have an
   adverse effect on communal peace. More subgroups of the larger ethnic
   group with policing institutions increase the risk of conflict.
   State-level regulation moderates these relationships. Additional
   evidence suggests that policing increases communal conflict through
   vertical jurisdictional conflict but otherwise achieves its intended
   purpose of providing security.},

   interpretive policy analysis},

Abstract = {Three decades after the argumentative turn in policy analysis and
   planning, interpretive approaches have become part of mainstream policy
   analysis. Increasingly, researchers work within these traditions.
   Researchers new to these approaches might struggle to make conceptual
   and methodological choices. We therefore compare three prominent
   interpretive approaches: discourse analysis, framing analysis and
   narrative analysis. Discourse analysis is the study of hegemonic,
   dominant and recessive discursive structures. It explores how power is
   embedded in language and (re)produces dominant social structures.
   Framing analysis involves studying processes of meaning construction. It
   explores what elements of reality are strategically or tacitly
   foregrounded or backgrounded in conversations and text, and how this
   includes and excludes voices, ideas and interests in policy and
   decision-making. Narrative analysis investigates the work of
   storytelling. It explores how people make sense of events through the
   selection and connection of story elements: events, settings and
   characters. These approaches share ontological and epistemological
   starting points, but offer different results. In this paper, we show
   what they each contribute to critical policy analysis and develop a
   heuristic for selecting or combining approaches. We give a renewed entry
   point for interpretive work and contribute to dialogs on commonalities
   and differences between approaches.},

Abstract = {The reputational perspective on agencies has sparked fruitful research.
   We argue that this perspective can also be applied to private actors in
   regulatory governance. As they are incorporated into governance because
   of their expertise, we hypothesise that a technical reputation dominates
   private actors ` regulatory talk. Furthermore, we test whether agencies
   have a more multi-dimensional reputational strategy than private actors.
   We analyse documents of private actors, national regulatory agencies
   (NRAs) and a European agency (ACER) in energy market regulation. We code
   rule drafts and agency decisions, and show that private actors not only
   use technical, but also legal and performative arguments. However, NRAs
   and ACER have a more balanced reputational strategy. They balance the
   reputational mix of the private actors when approving rule drafts,
   adding to the reputational dimensions that private actors neglect. Thus,
   our article shows how private actors and agencies differ in their
   regulatory talk within one rulemaking process.},

Abstract = {Inter-municipal cooperation is often regarded as an alternative to
   privatizing local public services. But cooperation and privatization can
   also be combined into a dual reform package in which several
   municipalities jointly issue contracts relating to multiple
   jurisdictions. Evaluation of these mixed cooperation-privatization
   reforms rests on disentangling the separate and combined effects of each
   strategy. This we undertake for the case of solid waste collection in
   Catalonia, using environmental protection as our focal performance
   standard. Drawing on two waves of data (for 2000 and 2019) for 186
   municipalities that together use all four combinations of public,
   private, single and cooperative service delivery, we show that superior
   environmental performance was initially confined to conventional
   cooperations involving only public production. But latterly, any form of
   cooperation, using public or private production, resulted in significant
   gains. This reinforces the need for evaluators to isolate the ``active
   ingredient{''} in composite reforms.
   La cooperacio intermunicipal es contempla sovint com alternativa a la
   privatitzacio de serveis publics locals. Tanmateix, cooperacio i
   privatitzacio es poden combinar dins un paquet dual de reforma en el que
   alguns municipis promouen contractes conjunts. L'avaluacio de reformes
   que combinen cooperacio i privatitzacio exigeix distingir entre efectes
   separats i combinats de cadascuna d'aquestes estrategies. Ho fem per la
   recollida de residus solids a Catalunya, usant la proteccio
   mediambiental com estandard de qualitat. Aprofitem dues onades de dades
   (2000 i 2019) per 186 municipis que usen les quatre combinacions de
   produccio (publica o privada) i provisio (cooperativa o individual) pel
   servei. Mostrem que la cooperacio convencional combinada nomes amb
   produccio publica presentava inicialment millor qualitat mediambiental.
   Mes recentment, pero, qualsevol forma de cooperacio, sigui amb produccio
   publica o privada, mostra millor qualitat. Els nostres resultats
   confirmen que es necessari que les avaluacions aillin l'{''}ingredient
   actiu{''} en les reformes combinades.},

Title = {Militarization matters: rhetorical resonances and market militarism},

Abstract = {``Militarization is not the problem{''} was the title of a recent
   conference contribution by Mark Neocleous. Many scholars in critical
   security studies share its message. Researchers on their account should
   shun a concept that does more harm than good. They should `forget
   militarization' as Alison Howell puts it. While sharing the concern that
   the term might direct attention away from police-violence and epistemic
   racism underpinning such conclusions, this article argues that the term
   militarization may be worth preserving in spite of this because it also
   does important political and analytical work that needs to be preserved
   if not strengthen. Recovering what Frazer and Hutchings term `rhetorical
   resonance', I suggest that the term `militarization' resonates with
   debates, discursive classifications and atmospheres, giving us a better
   grasp of contemporary, capillary, market militarism in its many morphing
   guises. Jettisoning militarization is to relinquish analytical openings
   and political attunement. I unpack this argument focusing on the
   resonances of militarization with market processes diffusing and
   deepening the grip of military concerns and de-mobilizing resistance.
   The resonances of militarization make managing, marketing, and
   materializing security into infrastructures less innocuous and hence
   trouble the de-mobilizing of resistance that ease them. The resonances
   of `militarization' break the silence surrounding market militarism, the
   processes generating it and the imbrication of knowledge practices
   (including the academic and scholarly) with them. Militarization
   therefore matters even when it stands in tension with epistemic racism
   and police violence. Therefore, deepening the engagement with
   militarization, to transform it, is important analytically and
   politically.},

Abstract = {Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) and security sector
   reform (SSR) programs are critical components of postwar transitional
   processes. The interlinkages between the two programs have been
   essential, especially in determining how combatants in armed groups and
   armed forces could become part of reconstituted security sector
   institutions, including the military and the police. Additionally, these
   links help determine who may be eligible as participants in these
   processes, and why some actors should be excluded. Over the past four or
   so decades, academic and policy understanding of postconflict settings
   has led to the acknowledgment that the two programs reinforce each other
   and should be designed to ensure fluidity and complementarity. However,
   there are usually gaps in linking the two, which have negative
   implications for peace, security, and stability in countries in
   transition from violence to peace. While there are several studies on
   the links between DDR and SSR, this paper seeks to examine both previous
   and current practices in both conflict and postconflict settings, with
   the aim of interrogating the changes that have been introduced over time
   to strengthen the links, and some of the gaps that are still existing,
   or emerging, especially as the nature of armed conflicts continue to
   change in Africa. Methodologically, the paper adopts a qualitative
   approach, through which interviews were conducted with practitioners,
   policy makers, and academics in the fields of DDR and SSR, across
   countries that previously implemented and those that are currently
   implementing DDR and SSR programs.},

Abstract = {The objective of transforming the EU in an Area of Freedom Security and
   Justice (AFSJ) area dates back to 25 years and in the meantime hundreds
   of legislative measures, political strategies and operational measures
   have been adopted even if, according to several critics, the original
   balance between the three notions of freedom, security and justice has
   not been granted. Two important books have analyzed the content of the
   measures adopted and the main obstacles still present even after the
   entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and of the EU Charter, which have
   removed most of the previous institutional and legal obstacles in
   fulfilling the original objective. However, as crisis such as 9/11 paved
   the way to the transfer to the EU of new power and responsibilities also
   the war in Ukraine unblocked, at least temporary, the current Dublin
   standstill. An unprecedented movement of interstate solidarity has
   followed sheltering millions of citizens of that country, and this
   precedent may show the way for a stronger freedom dimension in the AFSJ.},

Abstract = {The Polish Chamber of Physicians and Dentists (Naczelna Izba Lekarska)
   and the regional chambers of physicians and dentists (Okr \& eogon;gowe
   Izby Lekarskie) are the organisational bodies of the professional
   self-government of physicians and dentists in Poland. They are
   responsible for supervising the proper and conscientious exercise of the
   medical professions, determining the principles of professional ethics
   and deontology, and representing and protecting the medical professions.
   The history of Polish medical self-government dates back to the end of
   the nineteenth century. The development of the chambers was stopped in
   1950 by the communist regime when the authorities decided to dissolve
   them. This article, which is partly based on unpublished sources,
   presents the efforts of Polish doctors to regain their professional
   self-government. It shows how these efforts were linked to the
   democratisation processes of Poland in 1989.},

Abstract = {The coronavirus pandemic has brought a unique opportunity for local
   self-government in Slovakia. National legislation allowed city councils
   to hold meetings online or vote on proposals only in writing. It was
   mainly a safety measure in order to eliminate the spread of the disease.
   This alternative way of performing public administration was not
   possible in Slovakia before the pandemic. The paper presents the results
   of research mapping trends in the use of alternative ways of performing
   the activities of city councils in 2021 and 2022. This is a unique
   interpretation of data that has not been presented or published so far.
   The article presents the extent to which online meetings of councils or
   written voting by deputies were used during the pandemic in 141 cities
   in Slovakia. More than 53\% of the country's population lives in these
   cities. The study also presents comparisons of the results from the
   two-round data collection, which mapped the behaviour of city
   governments in two different time periods. In relation to the findings,
   the author opens a discussion about the benefits, but also the threats,
   which the new legislation brought with it for the functioning of local
   self-government.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses a range of aspects of political polarization in
   Mexico. It argues that political polarization is not a new phenomenon in
   the country but rather reflects the evolution and dynamics of the party
   system. Based on data from surveys, both academic and media, a number of
   patterns of polarization among the nationwide electorate are described,
   which may be ideological, party-based on emotional, and based on the new
   political axis of positions in relation to the so-called Fourth
   Transformation (4T). It also discusses diverse theoretical perspectives
   on political polarization, its metrics, causes and potential
   implications, seeking to further the discussion in relation to the case
   of Mexico and putting forward a number of considerations in this regard.
   The main aim is to document different facets of political polarization},

Abstract = {The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is the United Nations' most
   powerful institutional body, charged with the ``primary responsibility
   for the maintenance of international peace and security.{''} The main
   instrument through which the Council asserts this power is its
   resolutions, specifically by using resolution text to attribute
   responsibility. The UNSC uses responsibility language to assign tasks,
   identify accountability under international law, or reflect the
   Council's normative interpretation of political principles. Yet we lack
   a comprehensive empirical description of responsibility attributions in
   UNSC resolutions. We address this gap by providing an original dataset
   of the full text of all UNSC resolutions between 1946 and 2020. We use
   this data to show that the Council has significantly increased
   responsibility attributions since the end of the Cold War, but only for
   a very specific subset of terms, targeting predominantly states and
   individuals. We further demonstrate how the data can inform debates
   about the timing and status of the ``responsibility to protect{''} as an
   international norm. The data and findings provide a helpful starting
   point for many future research endeavors, including the role of member
   states in the UNSC, quantitative and qualitative research on UNSC
   decision-making processes, or topic development of the UNSC agenda in
   general.},

Abstract = {Across the world, an increasing number of states or state
   representatives have offered apologies for human rights violations,
   particularly since the 1990s. There is debate, however, on how valuable
   such gestures are and what impact they have. To address this, we
   examined what the perspectives of victim community members and the
   general public are in this regard, in different parts of the world. We
   focused on the apologies for the El Mozote massacre in El Salvador, the
   Jeju 4.3 events in the Republic of Korea, and Bloody Sunday in the
   United Kingdom, whereby we conducted 127 in-depth interviews with
   members of victim communities and the general public in these countries.
   Using thematic analysis, we found across these three countries that
   participants from the victim group and the general public saw the
   apology as a meaningful event because it acknowledges the suffering of
   the victims and breaks the silence about past atrocities. This suggests
   that apologies may answer to a broadly shared need for recognition.
   Nevertheless, the apologies were also regarded as limited in terms of
   their overall role in reconciliation processes and the further changes
   that they generate. The article concludes by discussing this
   ambivalence, present in both the apology literature as among our
   participants' responses across the world.},

Title = {Foreign Sponsorship of Armed Groups and Civil War},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Under what conditions do armed groups escalate their campaigns to civil
   war? Existing research suggests foreign states' material support is
   critical to explaining armed groups' conduct during civil war and,
   thereby, war intensification, duration, and outcomes. Thus far, little
   attention has been paid to understanding whether and how foreign support
   influences whether armed groups fight civil wars in the first place,
   largely due to data limitations. Armed group-level datasets have
   included only those already engaged in significant civil war violence,
   which introduces selection bias that precludes investigating factors
   that influence which groups fight civil wars. Leveraging the new Armed
   Groups Dataset (AGD), which measures characteristics of armed groups
   engaged in lower-level violence, we conduct a preliminary empirical
   investigation into the explanatory role of foreign sponsorship in
   group-level variation in civil war. While foreign sponsorship and civil
   war are correlated, there is little evidence that sponsorship has
   substantial independent explanatory value in predicting civil war.
   Rather, the evidence is consistent with claims that armed groups'
   organizational characteristics account for both access to foreign
   sponsorship and, independently, their likelihood of escalating civil
   war.
   En que condiciones escalan los grupos armados sus campanas hacia la
   guerra civil? Las investigaciones existentes sugieren que el apoyo
   material de los Estados extranjeros resulta fundamental para explicar la
   conducta de los grupos armados durante la guerra civil y, por lo tanto,
   la intensificacion, la duracion y los resultados de la guerra. Hasta
   ahora, se ha prestado poca atencion a intentar comprender si el apoyo
   extranjero influye, en primer lugar, sobre el hecho de que los grupos
   armados luchen en guerras civiles. Esto se debia, en gran parte, a las
   limitaciones de datos. Los conjuntos de datos a nivel de grupos armados
   han incluido solo a aquellos que ya estan involucrados en una guerra
   civil y que tienen un grado significativo de violencia. Esto introduce
   un sesgo de seleccion que impide investigar los factores que influyen
   sobre que grupos luchan en guerras civiles. Utilizamos el nuevo Conjunto
   de Datos de Grupos Armados (AGD, por sus siglas en ingles), que mide las
   caracteristicas de los grupos armados involucrados en actos de violencia
   de bajo nivel (Malone 2022), con el fin de llevar a cabo una
   investigacion empirica preliminar sobre el papel explicativo que juega
   el apoyo extranjero en las variaciones a nivel grupal en la guerra
   civil. Aunque el apoyo extranjero y la guerra civil se encuentran
   correlacionados, existe poca evidencia de que el apoyo extranjero tenga
   un valor explicativo independiente sustancial que permita predecir una
   guerra civil. Mas bien, las pruebas resultan coherentes con aquellas
   afirmaciones que mantienen que las caracteristicas organizativas de los
   grupos armados explican tanto el acceso al apoyo extranjero como, de
   forma independiente, la probabilidad de que estos intensifiquen la
   guerra civil.
   Dans quelles conditions les groupes armes transforment-ils leur campagne
   en guerre civile ? Les travaux de recherche existants suggerent qu'un
   soutien important d'etats etrangers est decisif dans l'explication du
   comportement des groupes armes lors de guerres civiles, et donc
   l'intensification, la duree et les issues d'une guerre. Jusqu'ici, l'on
   s'est peu interesse a l'influence du soutien etranger sur l'implication
   de groupes armes dans des guerres civiles pour commencer, en grande
   partie a cause de donnees limitees. Les ensembles de donnees au niveau
   des groupes armes n'incluent que ceux deja impliques dans d'importants
   actes de violence lors de guerres civiles, ce qui introduit un parti
   pris selectif qui exclut les facteurs explicatifs de l'engagement de
   groupes dans les guerres civiles. A partir du nouvel ensemble de donnees
   sur les groupes armes (Armed Group Dataset-AGD), qui mesure les
   caracteristiques des groupes armes impliques dans des actes de violence
   de moindre importance (Malone 2022), nous menons une enquete empirique
   preliminaire sur le role explicatif du soutien etranger vis-a-vis des
   variations au niveau du groupe lors de guerres civiles. Bien qu'il
   existe une correlation entre le soutien etranger et les guerres civiles,
   peu d'elements pointent vers une importante valeur explicative a elle
   seule du soutien quand il s'agit de predire une guerre civile. Les
   elements confirment plutot les affirmations selon lesquelles les
   caracteristiques organisationnelles des groupes armes expliquent a la
   fois l'acces au soutien etranger et leur probabilite d'escalade en
   guerre civile.},

Abstract = {We look for micro-level evidence of the security dilemma in Pakistan's
   Balochistan province using data derived from a 2011/2012, nationally
   representative survey of 16,279 Pakistanis as well as 2017 Pakistani
   census data. Using mixed effects generalized linear model for a binary
   dependent variable to identify determinants of individual perceptions of
   insecurity, we find that respondents who distrust the government are
   significantly more likely to feel insecure. Respondents in districts
   with greater in-group shares are significantly less insecure while those
   residing in districts with greater out-group share feel more insecure.
   We find modest evidence that cross-cutting cleavages can mitigate
   perceived insecurity.},

Title = {A critical evaluation and research agenda for the study of psychological
   dispositions and political attitudes},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {7-37},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Political psychologists often examine the influence of psychological
   dispositions on political attitudes. Central to this field is the
   ideological asymmetry hypothesis (IAH), which asserts significant
   psychological differences between conservatives and liberals. According
   to the IAH, conservatives tend to exhibit greater resistance to change,
   a stronger inclination to uphold existing social systems, and heightened
   sensitivity to threats and uncertainty compared with their liberal
   counterparts. Our review and reanalysis, however, question the empirical
   strength of the IAH. We expose major concerns regarding the construct
   validity of the psychological dispositions and political attitudes
   traditionally measured. Furthermore, our research reveals that the
   internal validity of these studies is often compromised by endogeneity
   and selection biases. External and statistical validity issues are also
   evident, with many findings relying on small effect sizes derived from
   nonrepresentative student populations. Collectively, these data offer
   scant support for the IAH, indicating that simply amassing similar data
   is unlikely to clarify the validity of the hypothesis. We suggest a more
   intricate causal model that addresses the intricate dynamics between
   psychological dispositions and political attitudes. This model considers
   the bidirectional nature of these relationships and the moderating roles
   of individual and situational variables. In conclusion, we call for
   developing more sophisticated theories and rigorous research
   methodologies to enhance our comprehension of the psychological
   underpinnings of political ideology.},

Abstract = {There is a growing body of research on the leading role of radical and
   populist parties to situate `sovereignty' as an increasingly central
   element of political discourse. However, there is much less said about
   the response of pro-EU actors, and how they can accommodate, modify, or
   reject the notion of `sovereignty'. The article begins with the
   following research question: what role does `European sovereignty' play
   in the legitimation strategies among pro-EU executive actors? Through a
   framing analysis of Spanish, French, German, and EU executive actors, we
   uncover the way in which they articulate (European) sovereignty in their
   speeches. We argue that the resignification of the concept of
   sovereignty as `European' plays a relevant role in the rearticulation of
   European politics, mostly led by French President Emmanuel Macron. The
   mainstreaming of `European sovereignty' has implications for power
   relations, as it orients European political debates towards a
   geopolitical perspective.},

Abstract = {In the analysis of the consolidation of the dictatorships that emerged
   in interwar Europe, religious and cultural festivals have received less
   attention than the political holidays created from scratch to reinforce
   their symbolic legitimacy. However, popular celebrations served as an
   effective tool for the transmission of ideology and the creation of
   spaces of interaction between the state and the people. This article
   analyses the different ways in which the Franco dictatorship
   instrumentalized religiosity and religious and cultural festivals during
   the years that the regime was under construction (1936-45). The study
   evaluates the extent to which the appropriation and resignification of
   popular culture and festive rites helped to consolidate the dictatorship
   and shape the Franco nation, while examining their impact on daily life
   and highlighting the subjects' capacity for agency in the redefinition

Title = {Capture and corporate cooptation: the role of the Mexican Foundation for
   Health in public health policy},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {Introduction Corporate capture responds to efforts to strengthen
   regulation or prohibition of commercial determinants of health
   {[}tobacco, alcohol, sugar-sweetened beverages, ultra-processed products
   (UPFs), commercial milk formula, and pharmaceuticals], in an attempt to
   interfere with public health policies that threaten the commercial,
   economic, and political interests of major industries. This manuscript
   proposes the characterization of the corporate capture of public health
   in Mexico, exercised through the Mexican Foundation for Health
   (FUNSALUD).Methodology An analysis of FUNSALUD and its stakeholders was
   carried out under the framework of commercial determinants of health,
   using a qualitative methodology, and executed in five stages: document
   analysis from 1985 to 2021; identification and characterization of
   stakeholders; semi-structured interviews; classification of corporate
   strategies; and relationship mapping.Results Actors in the
   pharmaceutical, food, tobacco, alcohol, commercial milk formula, and
   sugar-sweetened beverage industries were identified as corporate members
   of FUNSALUD. We identify six corporate strategies used to interfere in
   public health and food policies, highlighting the role of a revolving
   door bureaucracy in the case of the Ministry of Health.Conclusion The
   Mexican Foundation for Health has functioned as a front organization
   created by the private sector to influence public policy
   decision-making, protect corporate interests, and oppose international
   recommendations to combat non-communicable diseases.},

Abstract = {In the last twenty years, the EU has made increasingly greater efforts
   to boost defence cooperation among MS. To strengthen the EDTIB and avoid
   duplication of capabilities, the EU has encouraged ``European
   preference{''} in arms procurement and MS' defence collaborative
   projects, also by seeking to expunge defence offsets from the single
   market. Against this backdrop, on 24 February 2022, Russia invaded
   Ukraine. What impact has the war in Ukraine had on EU defence
   cooperation? Has the war impacted MS in a similar fashion or unevenly,
   reinforcing defence integration dynamics for some, while kickstarting
   disintegration for others? Two years on, a thorough analysis of the
   impact of the war on EU defence cooperation is still missing. This paper
   fills this gap by exploring three levels of analysis - arms
   collaboration, arms procurement, and offsets - and by comparing
   pre-invasion evidence with data from the post-invasion period. The
   analysis suggests that the Russo-Ukrainian war has negatively impacted
   EU defence cooperation, potentially increasing both fragmentation and
   non-EU dependencies. However, although MS' threat perception and their
   ability to reap industrial benefits remain important to explain EU
   defence cooperation, integration or disintegration dynamics do not
   neatly map onto the geographical or size divides identified by the
   literature.},

Abstract = {This study tests whether civil servant stereotypes affect how citizens
   experience public service delivery. Using a pre-registered survey
   vignette experiment (n = 1130), we activate civil servant stereotypes
   (negative, positive, or control) and assess whether this affects
   subsequent perceptions and evaluations of public services. Results
   indicate that stereotypes shape experiences, with the activation of
   negative stereotypes leading to lower levels of satisfaction and
   perceived performance, compared to positive stereotype activation and
   control. These findings emphasize that negative civil servant
   stereotypes can have problematic consequences, and contribute to our
   understanding of the commonly used Expectancy Disconfirmation Model in
   citizen satisfaction research.},

Abstract = {Are grant flows from the Westminster government to local authorities
   influenced by political dynamics, and if so do these politicised
   transfers influence local election outcomes? John and Ward suggested
   that, through the 1980s and 1990s, Conservative central governments
   favoured politically aligned local authorities. We demonstrate the
   continuation of this trend across the cohort of Labour, coalition, and
   Conservative governments from 2007 to 2019, and also establish evidence
   of inter-party variation in the type of grant manipulation in existence.
   We also more substantively extend John and Ward's work by demonstrating
   that electoral `ill-gotten gains' follow from these politicised flows,
   with higher resource transfers being associated with marginally stronger
   incumbent electoral performance. Given the importance of central grants
   to subnational government in the UK, these findings are of significant
   contemporary policy relevance.},

Abstract = {Neoclassical Realism popularised by including context into a
   structuralised worldview. However, far from a novelty, Global South
   scholars have been promoting similar Realist course corrections,
   reducing parsimony, and increasing explanation. This article compares
   Ayoob's Subaltern Realism, Escude's Peripheral Realism, and Yan's Moral
   Realism, showcasing how originality is displayed via hybridisation,
   mimicry, and denationalisation of ideas. There are two complementary
   goals: first, stress similarities and differences between these strands
   and Neoclassical Realism and, second, challenge the ongoing project of
   subsuming Realism to the Global International Relations agenda through
   Neoclassical Realism, as it has yet failed to incorporate these Global
   South ideas. I argue that acknowledging that these theories can promote
   core-periphery dialogue and instigate progress within the canon is
   essential for any Global North scholar interested in a `globalized
   Realism'. Finally, socioeconomic asymmetries and interdisciplinarity are
   central to building a Global International Relations Realism as well as
   recognising the persistent inequalities within International Relations
   knowledge production.},

Abstract = {Kenya's constitutional referendums in 2005 and 2010 stand out for their
   continuity with the national elections that followed both polls. During
   campaigns for and against the draft constitutions, politicians attempted
   to leverage their popularity amongst co-ethnics to signal their
   viability as coalition partners or `formateurs' in subsequent general
   elections: rather than nuanced debates on constitutional issues, the
   campaigns became personal contests that one observer dubbed an `industry
   of insults'. A decade later, this process was repeated as the country's
   political class considered further revisions to the constitution.
   Kenya's referendum campaigns thus reflect a layer of strategic behaviour
   that has not been recognized in much of the contemporary literature on
   democratization and constitutional change in Africa. While the substance
   of the country's constitution matters to Kenyan elites, referendum
   campaigns have added value to leaders independently of the outcomes of
   the polls themselves. The prominence of ethnicity as an organizing
   feature in Kenyan politics combined with high levels of party volatility
   produces an environment in which referendum campaigns serve as
   opportunities for Kenyan politicians to renegotiate political coalitions
   and realign party politics in between election cycles. In this way, the
   country's referendum politics are a distinct byproduct of its historical
   and political circumstances.},

Abstract = {Propaganda plays a key role in maintaining power in authoritarian
   regimes. Previous research finds that overt, crude, and heavy-handed
   messaging, so-called hard propaganda, can be used to effectively convey
   government strength and deter citizens from joining anti-regime protests
   in relatively stable autocratic regimes like China. Yet, it is unclear
   if this is also true in more contested and unstable autocratic contexts.
   In these settings, citizens are more likely to question such messaging
   and prior beliefs of government strength vary more widely. We explore
   the perception of hard propaganda in one such difficult test case for
   hard propaganda: the crisis-ridden Maduro regime in Venezuela. We
   measure perceptions of hard propaganda among the public using an online
   survey that featured a choice experiment in which respondents chose
   between and rated different propaganda images against more neutral
   political communication. Our results show that respondents perceived
   hard propaganda images as stronger compared to neutral political
   communication. This holds true - contrary to our pre-registered
   expectations - regardless of whether respondents overall perceived the
   government as strong or weak. Moreover, respondents reported a lower
   willingness to join anti-government protests but, at the same time, had
   a greater motivation to challenge the regime. These results support and
   extend prior findings on the effectiveness of hard propaganda in
   deterring anti-regime activities to the case of contested and unstable
   autocracies. But they also suggest that this kind of messaging erodes
   regime legitimacy providing the first evidence outside of the Chinese
   case of the pathology of hard propaganda.},

Abstract = {Support for EU membership has long been an important topic of study.
   Individual-level research shows that winners of globalisation, including
   the higher educated, express greater EU support as they profit from
   economic and cultural conditions resulting from European integration.
   Recent context-focused work suggests that individuals in `left-behind'
   places are less supportive of EU integration because of their home
   regions' weaker long-term economic conditions. This paper brings these
   two research strands into conversation with each other by examining how
   the relationship between EU support and individual-level education is
   contingent on subnational economic conditions. Using harmonised
   Eurobarometer data from almost 750,000 respondents spanning 2004-2019,
   combined with subnational economic data from 201 European regions, we
   find no evidence that subnational economic conditions influence the
   relationship between EU support and respondents' education level. At the
   same time, when cross-sectionally comparing long-term differences
   between regions, we find that EU support is positively related to
   regional GDP per capita (though unrelated to regional unemployment),
   among both the higher and lower educated, and especially in the
   post-Great Recession period. Longitudinally, EU support is positively
   related to declining regional unemployment, both among the higher and
   lower educated, but not to increasing regional GDP per capita.},

Abstract = {We argue that the everyday language distinction drawn between power and
   influence is meaningful and significant. There is good reason to believe
   that much corporate lobbying activity which is currently described under
   the heading of business power is better understood as attempts to secure
   negotiated agreements based on exerting influence rather than power and
   that the latter is usually used only when attempts to use influence have
   failed. We develop an analytical distinction between influence,
   understood as successful efforts at persuasion, and power using Keith
   Dowding's work on power. Drawing upon findings from interviews with
   corporate professionals operating at the coalface of business and
   government interaction in Australia, we show that lobbyists generally
   seek ``quiet{''} behind-the-scenes accommodations with governments via
   attempts to exert influence rather than power.},

Title = {Alternative policy narratives of the future of climate change: Analyzing

Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {635-653},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine the ways in which the futures of climate
   change and the climate change policy process are constructed as
   narratives-both explicitly and implicitly-in two different yet
   interconnected contexts that shape public climate discourse and debate:
   foresight-based political decision-making and journalism. The featured
   case is the National Energy and Climate Strategy of Finland for 2030. We
   employ and expand the Narrative Policy Framework to better understand
   the co-existent, implicit narratives of the future in the contexts of
   policy and media. We construct two co-existing yet contradictory
   underlying narratives of the future of climate change and climate
   policy. Our approach reveals that the prevailing master narrative of a
   desirable future is challenged by a co-existing counter narrative where
   policies in the energy and climate strategy prioritize shorter-term
   policy interests over climate change. Building on these findings, we
   argue that, in climate policy communication, communicators convey
   futures through narratives-both explicitly, as descriptions of what is
   perceived, hoped, and anticipated to happen, and implicitly, as the sum
   of the parts included and excluded.},

Abstract = {In recent years, public administration scholars have started paying
   attention to intersectionality of government workforce identities and
   its implications for diversity management. This study unpacks how the
   intersection of multiple identities increases the transaction costs
   inherent to under-representation by looking at employee engagement in
   uncompensated extra-role behaviors and its effect on emotional
   exhaustion. Using a structural equation model, we analyze original
   survey data of Los Angeles city government employees. Our analysis finds
   that the extra work experiences of minority employees are not homogenous
   within racial, gender, or generational groups. Among Black employees, it
   is women who bear the brunt of extra work burden. Further, among Black
   women, it is older generations who disproportionately engage in extra
   work and suffer from emotional exhaustion. An intersectional approach is
   critical to identifying the personnel most vulnerable to
   disproportionate job burdens and developing the human resource
   management practices that better support a diverse workforce.},

Abstract = {While many public organizations have made notable strides to improve the
   representation of women at all ranks, women remain severely
   underrepresented in law enforcement organizations. Research shows that a
   critical barrier to women's integration into law enforcement is the
   common perception among policemen that women are unsuited for police
   work. This study draws on Social Dominance Theory (SDT) to illuminate
   the values and beliefs underlying policemen's negative perceptions.
   Using multi-wave survey data and Ordinary Least Squares Regression
   analyses, we examine the association between social dominance
   orientation (SDO), an individual difference variable that captures
   preference for group-based social hierarchy, and officers' assessment of
   women's suitability for law enforcement. In line with existing evidence,
   our analyses show that compared to policewomen, policemen report
   significantly more negative assessments of women's suitability for law
   enforcement. We also find that higher SDO officers report more negative
   assessments of women in law enforcement, and officers' diversity value
   partially mediates this relationship. These novel findings suggest that
   officers who desire to protect existing power dynamics are more likely
   to resist organizational diversity efforts and hold more negative views
   about women's suitability for law enforcement.},

Abstract = {Scholars of the humanities and social sciences are necessarily
   storytellers. Thus, crafting narratives is an inescapable feature of the
   practice of International Relations scholarship. We tell stories about
   the past to orient ourselves in the present and envision the future.
   Historical International Relations has greatly expanded the repertoire
   of available narrative elements. However, when we read the past through
   the prism of our present, we risk closing down opportunities for
   different ways of imagining both the present and the future. In this
   article, we acknowledge the advances made in HIR over the last decades
   but suggest that a closer engagement with conceptual history would
   enhance its potential even further, making it possible to explore how a
   wider space of experience can also widen our horizon of expectations.},

Abstract = {By now we are familiar with studies which tie being `left behind' to
   voter support for populist or other extreme views. In the UK case, this
   is seen in support for Brexit but can also apply to support of parties
   such as UKIP (e.g. Bolet, 2021; Ford and Goodwin, 2014). Comparative
   studies show that electoral support for populist parties in part
   reflects lowered trust in mainstream politics (e.g. Geurkink et al.,
   2020; Keefer et al., 2021; Mauk, 2020), which is seen as a behavioural
   indicator of slipping legitimacy. Political support for populist
   movements is interpreted as declining legitimacy of existing
   governments, and that decline is seen as being tied to economic stress
   and the `left behind' areas. In this article, we ask whether economics
   stresses also have impact upon another and possibly more direct measure
   of government legitimacy - tax morale.},

Abstract = {This contribution analyses to what extent the EU's external response to
   the COVID-19 pandemic, communicated under the label `Team Europe',
   represents a critical juncture for the EU's development policy in terms
   of creating conditions for institutional change. As an area of shared
   competence, EU development policy processes predominantly seek to
   strengthen cooperation between the EU and its member states whilst
   respecting their respective competencies. Such initiatives have lacked
   success due to member states' resistance towards strengthened
   coordination, let alone integration. By contrast, the Team Europe
   approach promoted the pooling of choices and resources of EU
   institutions and member states and strengthened the frequency and
   political importance of enhanced cooperation. The article identifies the
   European Commission's policy entrepreneurship, the alignment with member
   states' interests, low levels of politicisation and broader contextual
   geopolitical changes as key explanatory factors influencing more
   favourable attitudes aimed at and prospects for closer cooperation as
   promoted by Team Europe.},

Abstract = {How does state-led repression targeting communities influence the social
   reproduction of victimized groups? Although several excellent studies
   have explored the sociopolitical consequences of a broad set of
   conflict-trauma legacies, notably, communal, religious and kinship
   drivers of responses to state violence, few researchers have explored
   the mechanisms of social status preservation under violence. The
   omission of class and social status from conflict research is puzzling
   considering that millions of people from Cambodia to China and from
   Russia to Hungary have suffered from state-led violence that targeted
   entire social groups and communities - from monks and priests with
   privileged positions in the social hierarchies, to the aristocracy and
   bourgeoisie. To generate theory about the mechanisms of social
   submission, adaptation or resistance in the face of group-based
   repressions, we explored the effects of Soviet repressions on the
   survival choices and reproduction of the Tzarist educated strata. For
   our analysis, we deployed subnational data on repressions and social
   structure and combined this with novel survey evidence and archival
   sources. We found that, contrary to conventional wisdom, repressions did
   not prevent the Imperial educated estates from engaging in habitual
   status- and identity-enhancing pursuits. Throughout the Soviet period,
   these groups continued to aspire to higher education and professional
   achievement. What is more, we show that continuity in pursuits was more
   common in places with more extensive repressions and a larger `stock' of
   pre-Revolutionary middle classes. We propose that in-group social
   bonding and permissive political opportunities facilitated social
   adaptation. Our findings contribute to conflict and social resilience

Volume = {61},

Pages = {296-321},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article presents a theoretical argument, defined as tension theory,
   to explain how the strategies of small powers during eras of great power
   competition are influenced by (i) the level of tensions between the
   great powers, and (ii) the availability of a great power ally. The
   explanatory power of tension theory will be demonstrated through a
   re-examination of Norwegian, Swedish, and Finnish diplomatic history
   from the early Cold War era. The findings strongly suggest that small
   powers desire low tensions between the great powers as this provides
   them with the opportunity to position themselves as neutral
   bridgebuilders to advance their vital and value interests. During
   periods marked by high tensions, which turn the relations between the
   great powers into a zero-sum competition, vital and value interests
   become of secondary importance to survival interest for small powers and
   force them to integrate with a protective great power to deter the
   threatening great power. In the absence of a protective great power
   during periods marked by high tensions, a small power will instead be
   forced to accommodate the threatening great power and screen itself from
   the latter's adversaries.},

Abstract = {Public inquiries into matters of conflict and security are vitally
   important yet undertheorised. This article explores the potential of
   inquiries for the democratic scrutiny of foreign policy, military
   doctrine, and grand strategy. In recent decades, there have been
   numerous inquiries into contentious foreign and security policy
   incidents in Britain, a trend reflected elsewhere in global politics.
   Inquiries can unveil facts, identify lessons, and rebuild trust. But
   critics claim that inquiries overlook systemic flaws. Our analysis
   transcends the usual arguments for or against public inquiries by
   explaining how inquiries produce knowledge and how this could be
   improved. We argue that inquiries necessarily involve the following
   three distinct processes: scandalisation, archivisation, and
   epistemology. We suggest how future inquiries could overcome extant
   limitations through a broader scope, diversification of evidence, and
   methodological pluralism. Such inquiries can play an improved role in
   promoting reflection and dialogue about a just international order and
   Britain's role within it.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between state formation, symbolic
   violence, and the blurring of public and private interests in Brazil.
   Drawing on a variety of sources - including academic literature,
   government reports, and media accounts - we use a historical approach to
   analyse how these factors have contributed to violence in Brazil,
   focusing on the case of the Northeast region. We argue that both
   symbolic violence and the problematisation regarding the separation
   between public and private interests have been overlooked in
   statebuilding literature. The blurring of public and private interests,
   grounded in symbolic violence (through the naturalisation of racism and
   aporophobia), contributes to sustained historical patterns of violence
   in Brazil. These patterns were introduced during the colonial period and
   have persisted to this day.},

Abstract = {Policy innovation is considered important for addressing major
   challenges such as climate change and the sustainable energy transition.
   Although policy learning is likely to play a key role in enabling policy
   innovation, the link between them remains unclear despite much research
   on both topics. To address this gap, we move beyond a binary treatment
   of policy innovation and differentiate policy problem innovation from
   policy instrument innovation and policy process innovation.
   Subsequently, we synthesise the literature on policy learning with the
   research on the multiple streams framework (MSF), a well-known lens for
   explaining policy innovation. Like earlier policy learning studies, we
   distinguish several types of learning by posing the key questions of
   learning, but in the context of each stream of the MSF: who learns
   (actors), what (beliefs), how (modes), and to what effect (ripening).
   This new conceptualisation clarifies the relationship of each type of
   policy learning to the varieties of policy innovation. Further, it
   indicates that policy learning is likely to result in policy innovation
   if and only if it influences the coupling among the three streams during
   a window of opportunity - through policy entrepreneurship - and not
   otherwise. We conclude with the implications of this study for future
   research on policy innovation, policy learning, and the MSF.},

Abstract = {This article uses a Polanyian frame to place the plight of Roma in
   Europe in the context of an age of crisis, as evidenced by faltering
   neoliberal economies and a corresponding rise in xenophobia and extreme
   manifestations of nationalism. The situation of the Roma remains
   precarious, a situation exacerbated by the 2008 economic crises and the
   COVID-pandemic. Despite a number of social inclusion measures in recent
   decades, at the national and European level which target the Roma, Roma
   exclusion remains a serious challenge. The paper assesses why previous
   policy regimes failed but also reflects on what is the way forward in
   terms of inclusive policy frameworks. The article seeks to provide some
   answers to these questions with a vision of a Polanyian countermovement
   in the form of a New Social Europe predicated on redistribution,
   recognition and community action but also a re-envisioning of
   integration and transformative change in structural and cultural terms.},

Title = {(De-)Legitimizing War: a linguistic analysis of Indian and Pakistani
   civil and military conflict discourses},
Journal = {CRITICAL MILITARY STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},

Pages = {61-82},

Abstract = {Language serves a decisive role for world leaders and politicians to
   legitimize their decisions to use a military option and wage a war to
   establish their ideologies. This work analyses the discursive
   legitimization strategies practiced by neighbouring states, India and
   Pakistan, in war discourse after a terrorist attack in Pulwama to
   legitimize their military actions. `Strategies of Legitimization', as
   envisaged by Reyes (2011) is employed as a framework. The sample
   comprises four military press conferences and four prime ministers'
   speeches. The results show that Indian civil and military discourse
   focused on the emotional aspect of legitimization augmented by the
   voices of experts and altruism to convince people to support war against
   Pakistan and take revenge for the Pulwama Attack. Pakistani civil and
   military discourse used emotions, hypothetical future, rationality,
   expert voices, and altruism to achieve legitimization for their
   no-action policy to avoid war. The study shows both religious states
   feed their people with emotional sentiments against each other and take
   an altruistic approach to the global community to rationalize their
   actions. Pakistan, a comparatively smaller economy, shows itself to be a
   harbinger of peace, whereas India roused emotions for immediate military
   engagement to achieve its political agenda. This article shows how acts
   of war are linguistically constructed to convince the public that war is
   inevitable. Such legitimization can in turn affect the global economy
   and peace, as in the recent Russian invasion that has caused global
   inflation and price hikes.},

Title = {The De Jure ``Brussels Effect{''}: Current Legal Trends in the EU's
   Unilateral Regulatory Globalisation},
Journal = {STUDIA EUROPEJSKIE-STUDIES IN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Anu Bradford employed the term ``Brussels effect{''} to discuss the
   European Union's ability to shape regulations and standards in the
   global marketplace through the EU's own unilateral regulatory action.
   That theory has been built around the notion that while the EU exercises
   its regulatory powers not to actively shape legislative frameworks
   outside its borders but mainly to establish and enforce standards for
   its own internal market, third country businesses, for various reasons,
   follow suit and, moreover, eventually the EU policies spill over to
   third countries themselves. However, several legislative developments
   and trends in recent years point to, beyond mere internal market
   regulation, the EU's more activist approach and a more ambitious agenda
   to impose its own policies and rules on foreign companies or even
   indirectly on third countries. Therefore, it is argued that the socalled
   ``Brussels effect{''} extends more and more outside the EU, seeking to
   affect the behaviour of third country businesses, as well as the choices
   and policies of third countries, where the EU considers this necessary
   in order to also pursue the EU's own global goals, such as protection of
   human rights, the management of climate change, combating the
   degradation of environment, mitigating the subsidisation of enterprises
   by states, or regulating AI. In that respect, a claim will be tested in
   the article which states that the internal regulation of the EU's own
   market, once the primary goal of the EU regulatory agenda, has greatly
   decreased in importance or has even become secondary; it is now the
   promotion of European values, the protection of EU businesses (also
   against the competitive disadvantages they suffer due to the EU's
   internal market rules) and the will to progress towards certain desired
   public effects at the global level that are mainly driving the most
   recent and most impactful EU regulations.},

The first thing he said was, ``It was all the spoons full of fish oil that grandma gave us!{''} He was only half joking about this. As he continued explaining, I noticed several strong similarities, but more importantly, some distinguishing divergences. My brother stated that his success, like mine, was something our parents expected of us. There was always this underlying message that we must do well in school and attend university. Beyond their expectations, our parents made sure to guard us against unfair and unreasonable school staff who would otherwise have implemented decisions to hamstring our educational advancement. In kindergarten, for instance, my brother's teacher spoke to my parents about classifying him as developmentally disabled and placing him with those children. My parents were incensed at this suggestion and emphatically rejected the idea. My brother pinpoints his fifth-grade teacher as a major factor in his later success. Noticing that he was excelling as a student and outperforming his peers, she recommended him for GATE classes upon entry to middle school. My brother would spend his middle school years enjoying the benefits conferred by GATE. A pitfall that my brother avoided was having to contend with Mr. Puckett as his middle school vice principal. Puckett was no longer at the middle school and wouldn't be able to persecute my brother the way he had done to me. My parents then made the decision to enroll my brother in an expensive private school for two of his four high school years. As my brother explains, the quality of the instruction and education at the private school was no better than the public school. Rather, the benefits lay elsewhere. First, the student body at the private school were being groomed by their parents and the school for entry to four-year institutions. His peers were preoccupied with scoring well on the SAT. Conversations would revolve around the various test preparation classes and books, as well as techniques, and strategies that would help attain a high score. After taking the test, they would compare each other's scores. Students at the public school rarely, if ever, spoke about the SAT. Second, unlike the public school, the private school provided their students with generous access to well-resourced and informed counselors whose job it was to ensure access to four-year colleges and universities. Every student was assigned a counselor who was dedicated to carefully shepherding them towards this goal. My brother described the counseling services as a safety net, ensuring that no one would fall through the cracks. The idea that students were going to attend a 4-year institution was so ingrained in the school culture, that many didn't need the counselors. After all, parents weren't spending thousands of dollars a year in tuition to have their children stray away to community college. Part of the justification for the high tuition fees was the high rate of acceptance into colleges and universities. The high school published their impressive transfer statistics in pamphlets distributed to prospective students, and highlighted the successes of their alumni in their alumni magazine. My brother recalls students being given a handout to put into their college and university applications. The handout explained that their private school GPA might be lower than a public school GPA due to the competitive environment at the former. He saw this as nonsense, in part, because there was a mandatory religion class every semester in which students were guaranteed a freebie A. One class my brother remembers as being highly beneficial was word processing. It was a mandatory class during his freshman year that must be passed in order to continue to sophomore year. The public school offered a word processing class, but it was an elective. Finally, my brother was a competitive soccer player who played at the varsity level starting his sophomore year. He was sidelined his freshman year due to a ruptured kidney suffered during playoffs in eighth grade. He says his participation in sport built his confidence and gave him a sense of competency that transferred to his academics..

Abstract = {This chapter presents the analytical framework of a unified view on the
   causes and consequences of the institutional choices for Europe. The
   basic question is whether the institutional reforms of the European
   Union, which political leaders-as the heads of state and government of
   the member states-negotiated at three major summits in the
   post-Maastricht period, divide or unite Europe. Do these political
   leaders-as the causes-effectively reform a widening and deepening
   European Union? Do their institutional choices for Europe-as the
   consequences-foster constraining dissensus or supranational consensus in
   the post-Maastricht period? It outlines the research design, introduces
   the broader theory of (supra)national partyism to derive propositions
   and hypotheses, presents the puzzles addressed and the plan of the book.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the security risks associated with international
   research collaborations have increasingly received attention.
   Consequently, it has been emphasized from politicians in the Nordic
   countries that tougher measures will be required from state actors. This
   article describes the development occurring in Sweden in the past few
   years and discusses the challenges that geopolitical rivalries bring to
   open international research exchanges. The tools commonly used can lead
   to overreach and impact researchers to refrain from collaborations
   rather than managing risks and miss the opportunities that international
   collaborations offer. These risks associated with international
   collaboration are more difficult to manage in collaborations that take
   place with researchers in countries that are culturally, legally and
   politically very different from Sweden, such as for example China. This
   article describes the work in Sweden to find a more nuanced way of
   working with international collaborations.},

   what outcomes for peace?},

Abstract = {Creating a stable peace is now the key puzzle to resolve in ending civil
   wars. To date, research has focused on `hard' political and military
   reforms included in peace agreements, and the impact of `soft'
   concessions such as language rights, cultural rights or the right to
   religion have been largely ignored. When do states give these
   concessions and do they make a difference to peace outcomes? The article
   argues that the state grants these concessions to dilute ethnic
   grievances and accommodate the group, bypassing political demands, but
   gives them strategically to ethnic groups that are politically weak. The
   concessions have effects through the expressive, demarcating and
   relational impacts on the receiving group. The article uses original
   data on identity concessions in a comparison of conflicts with ethnic
   aims that ended in a peace agreement from 1989 to 2013. The findings
   show that concessions are given to larger ethnic groups that lack
   political power. If granted, identity concessions only make peace more
   durable when fully implemented. The article thus brings a novel
   contribution to the role of grievances in civil wars and to the
   settlement of civil conflicts.},

Title = {Persuading the public: nationalist propaganda and support for costly
   environmental policies in China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 29},
Abstract = {China's ambitious plan for reducing carbon emissions may have a
   significant impact on its economy and impose an increased cost burden on
   the public. Conventionally, governments endure political costs when
   implementing unpopular policies. How can China achieve its goal without
   causing political risks? In this paper, we argue that China can promote
   its costly carbon policy through nationalist propaganda that points to
   international competition. Using an online survey experiment and an
   ethnographic study, we find that although nationalist propaganda does
   not increase public support for the policy, it successfully mitigates
   the political costs by increasing the respondents' political trust and
   motivating them to defend the government against criticism. Furthermore,
   such nationalist narratives do not reduce public support for
   international cooperation. This study provides insights into how China
   solicits support for its ambitious yet costly environmental policies.
   More broadly, this study reveals how autocrats can use propaganda to
   promote costly policies.},

Title = {Can information, compensation and party cues increase mass support for
   green taxes?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 25},
Abstract = {The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy presents a major
   challenge, with green taxes often seen as an efficient policy to promote
   environmentally friendly behaviour. However, these taxes are difficult
   to implement due to public concerns about immediate costs versus future
   environmental benefits. To address this, we conducted a survey
   experiment in Switzerland to investigate whether information on green
   tax effectiveness, compensation through revenue recycling, and party
   cues can make green taxes more attractive to citizens. Our findings
   indicate that information about compensation mechanisms and party cues
   can enhance support for green taxes, while single instances of
   information on green tax effectiveness do not significantly affect
   beliefs or policy support. Green tax proposals are more popular when
   compensation strategies address climate change or mitigate social risks
   and when there is broad party consensus providing clear cues to
   citizens. However, our findings also underscore the potential trade-off
   associated with a broad coalition of parties supporting green tax
   reform, which may lead to diminished support from the left. These
   insights have important implications for designing and communicating
   green taxes, highlighting the role of informed beliefs and political
   signals in shaping public attitudes toward environmental policies.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom is parliamentary elections have become more
   personalized. The idea of ``leader-centeredness{''} pervades electoral
   politics, with leaders supposed to have a critical impact on election
   performance and popular leaders anticipated to yield significant
   electoral dividends, perhaps even more than party evaluations. While
   scholars agree leaders can and do matter to the vote, deliberations
   continue regarding the manifestation and extent of these effects. Using
   an original dataset inspired by popularity measures from the Comparative
   Study of Electoral Systems project and incorporating data from up to 87
   elections in 30 polities, this article provides the first consistent
   aggregate quantification of demand-side behavioral personalization,
   disentangling the distinct and mutual influences of leader and party
   popularity to the extent possible. It finds that a leader's popularity
   directly correlates with party vote share and the likelihood of winning
   office, evidence of demand-side behavioral personalization. However, the
   effect of leader popularity on its own is consistently less potent than
   that of party popularity, providing an imperative nuance to the
   narrative regarding demand-side behavioral personalization.},

Abstract = {Few policymakers initiate policies that they know are malign, and are
   contrary to the public interest. Well-intentioned policies may, however,
   have unintended consequences that over time do make them, at least in
   part, malign. These policies may continue to produce some positive
   results for society, but they may also have significant negative
   consequences. Further, given that the malign nature of the policy tends
   to benefit powerful political and economic interests, once the malign
   aspects of the policy begin to manifest themselves, they tend to
   persist. This paper will use four mini-cases to understand better the
   transition from benign to malign policies. Two of the cases come from
   the United States and two come from Germany. Two cases will be in health
   policy, one in infrastructure, and one in crisis management policies. In
   all four cases policies that have over time began to demonstrate
   negative features continue to be implemented because of the benefits
   that they create for some interests in society-interests other than the
   original targets of the programs. In addition to the emerging literature
   on malign policies, this paper will have relevance for the large
   literature on unintended consequences (beginning with Merton in 1936),
   as well as the literature on Zombie ideas and failed policy ideas.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 3},
Abstract = {Emerging scholarship on Ukraine's wartime European integration and the
   EU's reinvigorated enlargement policy have been marked by the focus on
   intergovernmental matters and member states' foreign policy
   coordination. This article challenges this view. First, relying on the
   neofunctionalist lens, it introduces the notion of a `super-spillover'
   effect to explain the wartime intensification of Ukraine's European
   integration and the plans for Ukraine's gradual EU accession. It
   illustrates this notion with the case of Ukraine's Single Market
   integration. Second, while reaffirming the neofunctionalism's usefulness
   for explaining partner countries' Single Market integration and EU
   enlargement under crises, the article points to several weaknesses of
   the neofunctionalist approach. They include the vagueness of the
   `geographical spillover' concept and the lack of theorisation as to the
   sequencing of and the interplay between various spillover logics under
   crises. It thus contributes to the scholarship on neofunctionalism, EU
   enlargement policy, Single Market integration and EU-Ukraine relations.},

Abstract = {This article presents a case study of an integrated humanitarian
   intervention that combines mental health and psychosocial support
   (MHPSS) with livelihood assistance to enhance the psychosocial
   well-being, interpersonal relations, and social cohesion of internally
   displaced persons. Focusing on International Organization for
   Migration's MHPSS and Livelihood Integration project in Iraq, this paper
   critically assesses its outcomes and limitations in a protracted
   conflict and displacement context. Key findings reveal that MHPSS and
   Livelihood Integration project participants, compared to those in
   non-integrated programs, reported improved emotional well-being, new
   life skills and social skills, enhanced problem-solving and stress
   management abilities, as well as greater adaptability and motivation.
   Integration of MHPSS and livelihood activities also facilitated social
   network development and a sense of connectedness. These results show the
   effectiveness of integrated interventions in supporting the mental
   health and well-being of internally displaced persons, returnees, and
   vulnerable community members while promoting a sense of belonging and
   community cohesion, contributing indirectly to intracommunal peace and
   positive social transformation. Offering valuable empirical insights,
   this study contributes to humanitarian, development, and peacebuilding
   research by demonstrating how structured MHPSS activities can be
   integrated into livelihood programs to support the mental health and
   emotional well-being of affected populations in a protracted conflict
   setting.},

Title = {Liberal Democracy between Biopolitical Homeostasis and Autoimmunity},
Journal = {TELOS},
Year = {2024},
Number = {209},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {In this essay, I analyze the modern institution of liberal democracy in
   the context of the historical development of ``biopolitics,{''} as
   conceptualized seminally by Michel Foucault in the mid-1970s. I will
   argue that the principal virtue of liberal democracy is its social
   stability, and that the principal danger to it-and by extension the
   stability of Western societies-is its underlying tendency toward
   ``autoimmunity,{''} as classically theorized by Jacques Derrida, which
   is to say, toward destroying itself in an attempt to safeguard itself
   against misidentified threats. I will begin then by analyzing the
   functioning of liberal democracy in Foucauldian terms as a conjunction
   of biopolitical, disciplinary, and sovereign elements, tied in an
   ideological bow, before moving on to examine how its ideological
   structure makes it inherently unstable.},

Title = {Critical policy studies in dialogue with multispecies perspectives:
   should it become a more-than-human endeavor?},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {713-725},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {This forum contribution aims to start a conversation about how
   multispecies perspectives can broaden the scope of critical policy
   studies. By addressing three key questions - who speaks, whom do we
   speak for, and how do we speak for those who are silenced - it examines
   the power dynamics, ethical considerations, and representational
   challenges in advocating for nonhuman entities in governance. I discuss
   frameworks that recognize the rights and agency of nonhuman entities,
   such as animals, ecosystems, and rivers, with a particular focus on
   epistemic justice and the inclusion of Indigenous cosmologies that
   acknowledge the interconnectedness of humans and nonhumans. I also
   consider the methodological and ethical challenges, including issues of
   power, representation and informed consent, and explore alternative
   approaches such as multispecies ethnography to better include nonhuman
   perspectives. I conclude with three key strategies that can broaden the
   scope of critical policy studies: making visible silences concerning
   nonhuman entities in policy; rethinking representation of nonhuman
   entities in policy; and overcoming silences in representation by
   adopting reflexive, inclusive methodologies that account for nonhuman
   interests in policy.},

Title = {Why the dissemination of health information via government intervention
   is enhanced by a Culture-Centered Approach},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 20},
Abstract = {In a post-COVID-19 world, reflecting on the relative success of
   governments' involvement in shaping perceptions during global pandemics,
   the question of effective intervention is at play. COVID-19 has exposed
   the way in which many governments have failed through their messaging to
   bring coherent and trustworthy health policy. Many Western populations'
   rejection of top-down guidelines regarding the spread of disease was
   fueled by a lack of trust; an issue that has been the norm in much of
   the developing world. Conflicting responses by several governments in
   several Sub-Saharan African countries regarding the HIV/AIDS pandemic
   (beginning in the early 1980s) should have provided lessons about trust
   and inclusion in government messaging during global pandemics. This
   article provides an analysis of the crucial role that governments play
   in fostering trust and shaping perceptions during global pandemics. I
   argue that this is an idiosyncratic type of government intervention,
   where the dissemination of information, resource allocation, and
   required health measures do not suffice as stand-alone solutions. I
   employ the Culture-Centered Approach (CCA) framework, which highlights
   the importance of culture and trust when measures to shape behaviors and
   beliefs are being formed and implemented. I apply a comparative case
   study analysis of the public responses to the HIV/AIDS pandemic in
   Uganda and South Africa to argue that, without governments across the
   globe accounting for the cultural context at play with respect to their
   citizens, public health messaging and interventions will be less
   effective.},

Abstract = {Social innovation has broadly been defined as citizen-led initiatives
   aimed at improving community welfare through collaborative
   relationships. However, numerous studies demonstrate that social
   innovation might actually create new inequalities. In this paper, we
   address the following questions: how might socially innovative projects
   influence public policy? How can we understand a policy shift leading to
   institutions not only giving support to social innovation projects but
   even promoting their own social innovation schemes? Is institution-led
   social innovation different from citizen-led efforts? If so, how? We
   provide evidence of local public policy change occurring in 0-3
   education and care in Barcelona between 2015 and 2021. We explain how
   this happened, examining who redefined the issue and how, how the policy
   domain was reorganized, and how the policy subsystem was restructured.
   Our conclusions show how and why citizens and institutions define social
   innovation differently and how innovative 0-3 policy in Barcelona was
   adopted.},

Abstract = {Any peaceful resolution to the Cross-Strait conflict between China and
   Taiwan is likely to be composed of give-and-take between the two sides,
   and any agreement will ultimately require the support of Taiwan's
   citizens, by whom Taiwan's leaders are held accountable. Yet little is
   known about the actual tradeoffs Taiwanese citizens are willing to make
   in pursuit of an agreement in a time of peace. In conjoint experiments
   fielded in Taiwan in April 2022, we present Taiwanese respondents with
   hypothetical Cross-Strait agreements that randomly assign economic,
   security, and sovereignty-related concessions by the two sides. We find
   that support for agreements is conditioned by the concessions included,
   with sovereignty-related or security-related concessions by Taiwan
   lowering support, and sovereignty or security-related concessions by
   China increasing support. Additionally, respondents indicate that
   neither US support nor PRC threats significantly influence support for
   agreements, and that Taiwan's acceptance of an agreement substantially
   reduces the perceived likelihood of conflict.},

Title = {Migration communication campaigns: towards a research agenda and open
   database},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 12},
Abstract = {Every year, government agencies, international organisations, and civil
   society associations produce public communications campaigns designed to
   inform, persuade, and motivate behaviour regarding numerous facets of
   migration. Despite their increasing ubiquity, resources, and - possibly
   - impact, as well as the profound scientific relevance in understanding
   them, such campaigns remain relatively understudied and existing
   research is disjointed across various disciplines. This article takes
   three steps to propose and initiate a unified, interdisciplinary
   research agenda on migration communication campaigns (MCCs). First, we
   overview the need for a research agenda based on their increased
   substantive importance and scientific interest. Second, we outline what
   such a research agenda should look like, proposing six research themes.
   Third, we contribute to this proposed research agenda in two ways: with
   a typology of MCCs and by presenting our open-access, collaborative
   database to kick-start more systematic research in this field, including
   theoretical justifications for each variable. The database includes 301
   MCCs conducted in 32 European countries between 2012 and 2022. We invite
   submissions of all types of MCCs globally to create a bridge between
   communities of academics, policymakers, and communicators.},

Abstract = {For more than seven decades, since the partition of India and the first
   conflict over Kashmir in 1947-1948, the former Northern Territories,
   renamed Gilgit-Baltistan in 2009, have remained in a constitutional
   limbo. Under the control of Pakistan, but not part of its federal
   structure, these Himalayan lands, strategically located on the road to
   China, are a prisoner of the Kashmir dream. As Pakistan still refers to
   the old UN resolutions for solving the Kashmir dispute with India,
   Gilgit-Baltistan has not been made a province of Pakistan, despite many
   promises to do so. Gilgit-Baltistan was overlooked in the constitutional
   developments around the 18th Amendment. The latest official proposal in
   2020, to grant GB `provisional provincial status' was supposed to keep
   open the option of a plebiscite on Kashmir. However, this initiative
   stalled with Pakistan being engulfed in multiple crises. These complex
   circumstances create a conundrum whereby the political development of
   the region is held back, while divergent views on the future of the
   region are debated.},

Title = {Contesting focality in global health governance: The World Health
   Organization-World Bank relationship in historical perspective},

Abstract = {Focal organisations are typically seen as the undisputed leaders in
   addressing specific cooperation problems. However, as global governance
   becomes increasingly fragmented and contested, even well-established
   organisations are now facing challenges to their traditionally
   unquestioned focality. Drawing on new theoretical insights, the article
   contends that the contestation of focal organisations is not a new
   phenomenon. On the contrary, most focal organisations experience
   challenges to their focality from their very establishment. At the same
   time, focal organisations are likely to respond to these challenges with
   tailored, ad hoc strategies. The article tests these expectations in the
   case of the global health governance complex, where the initial focality
   of the World Health Organization was contested by various actors since
   the outset. Among those contesting the World Health Organization's
   focality, a prominent position was gained by the World Bank. By
   examining the interinstitutional relationship between the World Health
   Organization and the World Bank from the 1970s onwards, the article
   shows how this dynamic impacted the World Health Organization's focality
   and influenced the broader evolution of the global health complex over
   the past decades.},

Title = {Democratisation in Southern Europe: a contingent or inevitable process?},
Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 7},
Abstract = {Debates on democratisation often struggle to reconcile structural and
   agency approaches. Structural explanations highlight factors like
   economic development, natural resources, inequality, and international
   power shifts. Agency-based explanations focus on the choices of
   political actors, including elites and social movements, and their
   interactions leading to democracy. This study compares Greece, Portugal,
   and Spain, harmonising these perspectives. Structural and agency forces
   are not contradictory when temporal scope conditions are clearly
   defined. Despite differing democratisation paths, Southern European
   countries experienced rapid modernisation, and political, social, and
   economic convergence during the consolidation phase. Modernisation
   favoured liberal democracy and democratic consolidation through varied
   events and actor combinations. Our analysis underscores the importance
   of considering both structural and agency-based factors in understanding
   democratisation processes.},

Title = {From strategic autonomy to strategic partnership: EU-India relations in
   health diplomacy},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Pages = {901-914},

Abstract = {The study examines the potential of the European Union (EU)-India
   cooperation in health diplomacy and the exchange of lessons learned by
   both actors. Particularly, the growing discourse on achieving strategic
   autonomy in health has not been adequately analysed in the existing
   literature, which is surprising given that both actors share this
   interest. This paper begins by contextualising the discourse of
   strategic autonomy in the European and Indian political discourse with a
   specific focus on achieving autonomy in health and subsequently argues
   for a transition from strategic autonomy to a strategic partnership by
   recognising the strategic interdependencies. A qualitative content
   analysis was used to analyse all 16 EU-India summits to locate health
   diplomacy in their relations and present recommendations for future
   cooperation. The shift from strategic autonomy to strategic partnership
   also necessitates a strategic vision towards shaping the EU-India
   cooperation. With the upcoming EU-India Summit in 2025, research and
   development, strengthening supply chains, harmonisation of regulations,
   and financing of healthcare are key areas that can be deliberated on to
   enhance the cooperation between the two global actors in healthcare.},

Abstract = {A confluence of forces over the past year have increased the likelihood
   of militarised conflict on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea, emboldened
   by a new partnership with Russia and ongoing support from China, has
   embarked on a series of provocations while rejecting repeated US offers
   of dialogue. Inter-Korean tensions have also spiked due to the recasting
   of long-standing unification policies on both sides and Pyongyang's
   bizarre balloon offensive. Given North Korea's dismal domestic
   situation, exacerbated by its harsh three-year COVID-19 lockdown, the
   regime could stoke external conflict to distract its population. US
   election years are historically periods of heightened North Korean
   belligerence, and therefore further rounds of escalation are likely in
   the coming months. The US and its regional allies should focus on
   upholding deterrence and weakening the North Korea-China-Russia axis,
   while pursuing initiatives to alleviate the suffering of ordinary North
   Koreans.},

Abstract = {Evidence suggests that populist parties, especially but not exclusively
   of the radical right, are more supported by men and can be a threat to
   gender equality. However, systematic analyses are missing regarding the
   connection between individuals' attitudes towards gender equality and
   populism. We examine this link using original panel data gathered online
   in Spain in two waves, and find a general positive association between
   hostile sexism and populist attitudes. Our results contribute to
   unraveling one potential connection between the politicisation of gender
   equality and the spread of populism in Spain, a phenomenon that is also
   found in other countries of Southern Europe.},

Abstract = {Transnational surveillance is a powerful tool in the arsenal of
   autocrats the world over. Despite its pervasive use in extraterritorial
   coercion, the systematic study of surveillance of regime opponents
   beyond national borders remains underdeveloped in political science,
   primarily due to limited data availability. To help fill this gap, we
   constructed the Latin American Transnational Surveillance dataset, a
   micro-level dataset based on declassified foreign surveillance reports
   produced between 1966 and 1986 by autocratic Brazil. Latin American
   Transnational Surveillance records the identity, locations, social ties
   and political activism of 17,000 individual targets of transnational
   surveillance, the vast majority of whom were tracked in neighbouring
   countries across Latin America. Drawing on these abundant data, we
   empirically explore existing theoretical insights about the motivations,
   methods and consequences of transnational surveillance, a task that
   would be difficult to do using other sources. We also leverage social
   network analysis to showcase potential applications of Latin American
   Transnational Surveillance in the testing of collective-action theories
   of transnational political violence.},

Abstract = {Many people want the government involved in healthcare. Is this because
   citizens are concerned about their own vulnerability, the plight of
   vulnerable others, or both? To test for these concerns, we used
   representative surveys and experimental economic games. We found robust
   evidence for concern for others. In surveys, people who worried about
   vulnerable others wanted more government involvement in healthcare. In
   experiments, people with the opportunity to subsidize vulnerable others
   often helped. The evidence for personal concern was more mixed. In
   surveys, people who were personally vulnerable did not usually want more
   government involvement in healthcare. In experiments, however,
   vulnerable people often wanted more healthcare. Additional data suggests
   that concern for the vulnerable is motivated by social preferences,
   empathy, and compassion. We discuss how the logic of healthcare is
   different from other aspects of the welfare state and therefore needs to
   be studied separately.},

Abstract = {Since the 1980s, the growing wealth disparity in advanced capitalist
   societies has drawn attention from political economy scholars due to its
   profound effects on political systems. This research explores the
   relationship between wealth inequality and the stability of democratic
   institutions, focusing on how subjective class perceptions shape support
   for democratic governance. The findings indicate that as wealth
   inequality intensifies, it significantly reshapes class identities,
   influencing attitudes towards democracy. Both the subjective lower and
   upper classes exhibit diminished support for democratic systems, albeit
   for different reasons, which may pose risks to democratic stability. In
   contrast, the subjective middle class, a stronghold of democratic
   values, is shrinking in both proportion and influence as wealth
   inequality widens, potentially weakening democratic institutions
   further. This study underscores the connection between increasing wealth
   inequality and challenges to democratic values, highlighting the
   importance of policy measures to protect democratic integrity in the
   face of rising economic disparities.},

Abstract = {The contemporary phase of capitalism has led to an intensification of
   the process of ``accumulation by dispossession,{''} which entails a
   growing conflict between territorial displacement and indigenous
   resistances. These conflicts manifest in projects for autonomy that take
   on diverse forms. Here, we address the origins of these various concepts
   of autonomy while focusing on their corresponding dilemmas and strategic
   choices across different historical contexts. Finally, we look at the
   examples of Zapatista autonomy in Mexico, the experiences of the Pur \&
   eacute;pecha community of Cher \& aacute;n, and the Mapuche struggle in
   Wallmapu/Chile, three distinct models where organizational processes
   themselves forge new collective subjectivities meant to confront
   neoliberal capitalist dispossession.La fase contempor \& aacute;nea del
   capitalismo ha generado una intensificaci \& oacute;n del proceso de
   ``acumulaci \& oacute;n por desposesi \& oacute;n,{''} lo cual implica
   crecientes conflictos entre el despojo territorial y las resistencias
   ind \& iacute;genas. \& Eacute;stas se manifiestan en formas diversas de
   proyectos de autonom \& iacute;a. Analizamos el origen de las variantes
   del concepto de autonom \& iacute;a, enfocando en sus correspondientes
   dilemas y sus opciones estrat \& eacute;gicas en diversos contextos hist
   \& oacute;ricos. Finalmente, consideramos las experiencias de la autonom
   \& iacute;a zapatista, la comunidad pur \& eacute;pecha de Cher \&
   aacute;n, y la lucha mapuche en Wallmapu/Chile, tres modelos distintos
   en donde el propio proceso organizativo forja nuevas subjetividades
   colectivas para enfrentar el despojo del capitalismo neoliberal.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the awareness, perceptions, and preparedness of
   Romanian construction developers and public procurement specialists in
   relation to nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (nZEBs), focusing on factors
   that influence their adoption. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the
   research analyzes 193 validated questionnaire responses and insights
   from interviews with four industry experts. The findings reveal a
   significant disparity in familiarity with nZEB, with developers
   exhibiting greater awareness than procurers. Compliance with regulations
   emerges as the primary driver for nZEB adoption, while high upfront
   costs and a scarcity of qualified workforce are major barriers.
   Additionally, the complexity and fragmentation of Romanian legislation
   on nZEB standards creates ambiguities and further hinders effective
   implementation. Despite these challenges, developers express moderate
   optimism about Romanian construction companies' adaptability to future
   nZEB demands, whereas procurers remain less confident. The study
   underscores the critical role of proactive policy interventions, clear
   public procurement criteria, and collaborative strategies in aligning
   government-funded projects with energy efficiency goals. By addressing
   systemic barriers and fostering innovation, this research provides
   policymakers and stakeholders with actionable insights to facilitate a
   smooth transition to sustainable building practices in Romania.},

Abstract = {This contribution examines Egypt's foreign policy towards the
   Russia-Ukraine war through the lens of its long-standing commitment to
   the principle of equal sovereignty. Despite its historic adherence to
   and promotion of this principle, Egypt adopted a balancing position,
   refraining from publicly condemning Russia or fully supporting Ukraine.
   By comparing Egypt's stance on the Russia-Ukraine war to its responses
   in previous cases involving the violation of territorial sovereignty, we
   demonstrate how Egypt's balancing position on the war represents a
   deviation from the sovereignty principle. Our analysis suggests that
   while Egypt has traditionally viewed the sovereignty principle as a
   cornerstone of its national security and foreign relations, the adverse
   impact of the Ukraine war on its national security has compelled a
   reassessment of this stance.},

Title = {Envisioning ecological security through local direct action: community
   resistance with global resonance},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON SECURITY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 26},
Abstract = {As climate change becomes a pressing concern for policymakers and
   citizens around the world, a variety of security discourses have emerged
   framing the environment as a security issue. While dominant frameworks
   focus on securing national interests, the international order, or
   individuals, the ecological security framework presents an alternative
   discourse. Ecological security requires a refocusing of the security
   discourse onto the environment itself, vulnerable communities, and
   future generations, and requires the exploration of alternative,
   relational forms of social and economic organisation. This framework has
   often been discounted as an impractical and radical alternative to
   dominant discourses, however, I argue that ecological security can, and
   is, being enacted by local communities around the world through
   radically relational activist methodologies. I suggest that direct
   action methodology employed by environmental activists can enable the
   enactment of ecological security by local communities. By investigating
   the connections and overlaps between blockade-style activism, direct
   action methodology, and Indigenous resurgence, it is possible to
   envision a locally-based, radically relational, bottom-up model of
   ecological security. Through an investigation of the conflict between
   Wet'suwet'en land defenders and the Coastal GasLink pipeline, this
   community-activist-ecological security nexus is drawn out and examined
   as a possible path forward for climate security.},

Abstract = {Public servants have a significant impact on peoples' lives, but we
   don't have many reliable estimates of how many employees engage in
   prosocial rule-breaking (PSRB), a form of constructive deviance. We
   collected original survey data (N = 497) among a representative sample
   of Greek public servants and implemented a list experiment to gauge how
   pervasive PSRB is in Greece's public sector. Greece is a particularly
   useful setting in which to study PSRB as the euro crisis created strong
   reform pressure. We find that public servants who were hired via merit
   competitions are not less likely to break rules, but this is conditional
   on their beliefs about career prospects and the fairness of the
   promotion system. They perceive the professional reward system as biased
   towards those with political connections and compensate for lack of
   efficiency by doing favours. This finding raises concerns about the
   quality of EU reform assessments.},

Abstract = {As more women enter politics, public and scholarly narratives about the
   extent and nature of gender bias in mediated campaigning environments
   diversify. Yet there is still little understanding of how voters
   substantively think about gender in their evaluations of women and men
   candidates and how voters' thoughts are affected by different types of
   media coverage. Drawing on literature on gender stereotyping and
   rationalization, this paper distinguishes two roles in which gender
   manifests in the candidate evaluation process-as a heuristic and as a
   rationalization. We empirically investigate these different ways in
   which gender affects voters' thoughts following neutral and contextually
   rich candidate stimuli by means of a mixed methods think aloud study.
   The results show that voters think less-but more positively-about
   substantive aspects of women's political profiles. These favorable
   thoughts include heuristic inferences of communal traits for women but
   not men candidates. Moreover, we find that voter rationalizations
   involve gender as ex post vote justifications and socially desirable
   drivers of candidate evaluations. Together, the findings not only
   showcase the complex roles of gender in voters' candidate evaluations
   but also the importance of considering the normative context in which
   vote decisions take place.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the comparative literature on intergovernmental relations
   this article analyses the dynamics of executive federalism in Pakistan
   with a focus on relations between the federation and Sindh province.
   Pakistan presents an interesting case for the study of intergovernmental
   relations in a contested federation. This article highlights the
   intricate workings of intergovernmental relations in a centralised
   federal system by assessing the executive bargaining over two key issue
   areas: water-sharing and management of the Covid-19 pandemic. I argue
   that the broader pattern of centre-province relations in Pakistan
   remains unchanged despite more than a decade of implementation of the
   18th Amendment. My argument identifies the critical role of partisan
   politics in the management of intergovernmental relations. The populist
   government in Islamabad led by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (2018-2022)
   and the polarisation prevalent in the party system impacted
   intergovernmental relations. Agreement between federal and Sindh
   governments became difficult. The role of mediatory institutions,
   especially the Council of Common Interests in managing executive ties is
   assessed.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON SECURITY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 5},
Abstract = {Since the Web 2.0 revolution, war and war communication are no longer
   under the control of states. Rather, the new media ecology entails the
   possibility that internet users get involved in the info politics of any
   armed conflict around the world. This article explores the North
   Atlantic Fella Organization (NAFO) as an expression of this emerging
   mode of participatory warfare that traverses the virtual battlefield of
   information warfare and the real-life battlefield of military warfare.
   It argues that NAFO acts as a cross-border war actor that exerts
   hypermemetic agency through strategic storytelling. To this end, it
   adapts the strategic narrative approach to the relational agency of
   hypermemetics. The example of NAFO shows how joint hypermemetic practice
   can have strategic effects in winning the information war against Russia
   for Ukraine.},

Abstract = {Europeans are thinking more about how to respond to transatlantic
   uncertainty and geopolitical insecurity. The outlines of a new landscape
   in continental relations are emerging. There is a clear commitment to a
   stronger `European pillar' within NATO. A reset in EU-UK defence
   relations is under way. A new, more influential and more united European
   Union leadership team will boost the EU's engagement on defence and
   security. The turnaround will still struggle to match the United States'
   own step change in defence-industrial production, and is still
   frustratingly off pace for Ukraine's requirements. There is also a
   danger that fiscal and populist constraints will undermine the scale and
   tempo of European ambitions. Nevertheless, a course correction is
   belatedly under way.},

Abstract = {Why do men and women vote for the populist radical right? This question,
   which speaks to the phenomenon of the ``radical right gender gap{''},
   has been the topic of much scholarly interest. While previous studies
   refer to the role played by differences in political resources,
   attitudes, and socialization, this paper examines whether negative
   emotions towards the political system, and system-directed anger in
   particular, drive support for populist radical right parties differently
   for men and women. Drawing on the premise that populist radical right
   parties tend to appeal to angry voters, and given that acting upon anger
   is seen as an ``agentic{''} trait, we expect that system-directed anger
   is more strongly associated with support for populist radical right
   parties among men compared to women. We test the hypothesis using
   original data from the RepResent voter survey organized in Belgium
   during the 2019 federal elections. In line with previous studies, we
   find that voters of the populist radical right party Vlaams Belang
   report high levels of system-directed anger. Men and women voters are
   similar in their display of this emotion, and contrary to our
   expectations, they are similar in how system-directed anger relates to
   vote choice as well. More than explaining gender differences in populist
   radical right voting, our findings confirm the idea that system-directed
   anger can incite women as well as men to cast a populist radical right
   vote.},

Abstract = {PurposeIt is a challenge for Small-Cap companies, i.e., Small and
   Medium-sized listed companies in Hong Kong ({''}SMEs{''}) in
   Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) reporting as they may lack
   knowledge, skills and motivation. This paper investigates a spectrum of
   the drivers and barriers that these SMEs faced for better ESG
   reporting.Design/methodology/approachIn this study, 22 persons
   responsible for ESG reporting in their SMEs were interviewed. The
   results were analysed by using grounded theory with the assistance of
   concept mapping.FindingsRegulations and management support are the first
   two critical drivers, whereas lack of management support and lack of
   expertise are the first two significant barriers. To overcome the
   obstacles, various stakeholders including regulators, bankers,
   investors, customers, competitors, NGOs and employees have their roles
   to play. Stakeholder theory is most relevant in explaining the results
   as stakeholders can exert effective pulling forces by creating tangible
   benefits for SMEs, resulting in more substantial management
   support.Originality/valueThis is amongst the first comprehensive
   investigation on the motivational factors in SMEs' ESG reporting. Policy
   makers should not only focus on the effort to upgrade the reporting
   standards but also contemplate more effective ways to balance the
   short-term and the long-term benefits of ESG reporting by mobilising
   various stakeholders to exert more influences.},

Abstract = {Recycling carbon revenues as Equal Per Capita Carbon Dividends (ECDs) is
   thought to neutralise the two main objections to carbon pricing, namely
   that it is regressive and that it hinders the poor from meeting basic
   needs. This article focuses on the waste objection to carbon pricing
   plus ECDs. If the rationale for ECDs is to protect the consumption of
   the worst off, why pay carbon dividends to the rich as well? I examine
   three different normative arguments in favour of ECDs. First, the
   argument of common ownership of the atmosphere, which can be based on
   both libertarianism and isolationist egalitarianism. Second, the
   argument that the rich are net contributors to ECDs through their carbon
   taxes. Third, a consequentialist argument focusing on the pragmatic
   advantages of ECDs, especially in terms of social acceptability and low
   information costs. I conclude that none of these arguments can provide a
   normative justification for ECDs.},

Abstract = {Despite the wealth of literature examining the spatial policies of the
   Justice and Development Party (AKP) governments, there has been a
   noticeable absence of comparative studies with the spatial concepts
   found within Turkish Islamism. This article suggests that the use of
   space as a political tool in cultural conflict has roots dating back to
   the nineteenth century, and that Islamism has perpetuated this tradition
   into the Republican period, particularly during the 1990s. By analysing
   the spatial policies and practices enacted by the AKP governments,
   valuable insights can be gained into the potential trajectory of
   Islamism in Turkey. The disparity between the Islamist conceptions of
   space in the 1980s and 1990s and the policies implemented during the AKP
   era not only underscores the controversies and conflicts surrounding
   space, but also provides an illuminating view of Islamist strategies.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a special issue in Peacebuilding on researching
   masculinities during peace processes. It collates insights from feminist
   peace research, and research on gender and masculinities, to highlight
   how peace processes are necessarily also processes of gender
   re-negotiation and transformation. We argue that researching
   masculinities entails accounting for their plural circulation, complex
   and contradictory dynamics, and multiple effects. Researching
   masculinities additionally generates methodological dilemmas that
   require researchers' reflexive engagement. The articles in the special
   issue address critical themes and topics pertaining to masculinities and
   peace across a wide range of participant experience in diverse contexts
   (including Bosnia, Indonesia, Liberia, Timor-Leste, Uganda, and the UK).
   We summarise authors' critical and empirical contributions and chart
   their methodological innovations and strategies. We see plural masculine
   performances and identities not as obstacles to be overcome in/through
   research but as opportunities to generate discussion with research
   participants about the operability and impacts of gender.},

Title = {Is AI-Generated Extremism Credible? Experimental Evidence from an Expert
   Survey},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 2},
Abstract = {Rapid progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) over the past few years
   has unfolded important questions-and triggered anxiety-about the
   potential (mis)use of AI-generated content in information warfare and
   disinformation campaigns. A crucial question remains unanswered,
   however: whether-and to what extent-this technology can be harnessed in
   a credible way by extremists, whose language is usually characterized by
   highly specific subcultural registers that make them unlikely to be
   easily mimicked by AI models. This paper answers that question, offering
   the first rigorous evaluation of the credibility of synthetic
   (AI-generated) extremist prose. Using an expert survey experiment
   measuring the credibility of fake incel forum posts and ISIS magazines
   paragraphs generated through an original workflow for the production of
   synthetic extremist text, we show that these texts have high credibility
   scores, confusing world-leading experts. These findings, which are
   discussed under the broader light of the emerging literature on
   nefarious ``dual-use{''} of synthetic content, not only define and
   evaluate the threat of extremists harnessing language models for
   propaganda, but they also more broadly strengthen our understanding of
   the role language models are due to play in hostile political
   communication, and ultimately resurface the debate on the human costs of
   technological progress.},

Abstract = {Building situational awareness has become a central logic among
   contemporary security apparatuses for abating no-warning urban
   terrorism. Situational awareness, we contend, casts the sensory,
   perceptual and affective capacities of human bodies to decipher their
   immediate surroundings and attune to the non-representational and
   more-than-known of an enfolding situation, as essential to its
   execution. What modalities of sense-making and attunement, then, does
   this burgeoning security rationality demand? And what sensibilities,
   affectivities and subjectivities are (re)produced and legitimated across
   urban life? In this paper, we unpack these questions by examining the
   ways affective and atmospheric attunement(s) are infused within orthodox
   and emergent security approaches for developing and honing situational
   awareness. We argue that affective atmospheres in particular furnish the
   theoretical architecture for attending to the spatio-affective-material
   registers through which imminence becomes palpable. Empirically, by
   analysing the Public Inquiry following the 2017 Manchester Arena attack,
   we elucidate where the Inquiry advanced discussions on (the limits of)

Abstract = {This article examines the complexities of policy transfer between China
   and Tanzania, focussing on the influence of linguistic and cultural
   discrepancies. It explores how African governments, particularly
   Tanzania, interpret and adapt Chinese policy concepts to align with
   their domestic priorities. The study employs a multi-method approach,
   including interviews, document analysis and literature review, to
   investigate the dynamics of Sino-Tanzanian relations. Findings reveal
   that while China's development and security discourses resonate with
   African policymakers, the semantic nuances and historical contexts of
   Chinese terms often lead to divergent interpretations. Despite several
   initiatives from China to infuse policy concepts into Tanzanian
   discourse, including projects such as a party leadership school and
   party-to-party dialogues, there are to date no successful adaptations or
   transfers of Chinese macro-policy concepts to Tanzania. The research
   highlights the critical role of language and cultural context in policy
   transfer processes, challenging the traditional view of passive policy
   reception in the Global South. It contributes to the broader
   understanding of policy transfer, emphasising the need to recognise the
   dynamic interplay of language, culture and political agency in the
   process. The study concludes with recommendations for recognising and
   addressing the interpretive challenges in international policy transfers
   to enhance mutual understanding and cooperation.},

Abstract = {This article contends that digital technologies are profoundly altering
   peacekeeping practices as well as peacekeeper consciousness and modes of
   being. It is proposed that combining postcolonial humanist and
   posthumanist ontological perspectives when undertaking ethnographic
   research enrichens investigations into global race and gender power
   relations in peacekeeping. Drawing on posthumanism and Bourdieusian
   practice theory, the article examines how 16 British infantry soldiers
   articulate reconnaissance and civilian protection experiences and
   construct their militarised masculinities prior to and after deployment
   to United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in
   Mali (MINUSMA) in 2020-2021. Findings show that deployment to a
   high-risk, stressful mission and functioning as `information processing
   devices' in an increasingly centralised UN peacekeeping system
   disempowers and emasculates the men. The peacekeepers respond by
   engendering and racialising the British Army's `gender-neutral' cyborg
   soldier figuration and draw on virtual gaming syntax and framings to
   create relational distance between themselves, female colleagues and
   local populations.},

Abstract = {Critical Frame Analysis (CFA) is a method for analyzing policy framing
   by excavating rhetorical meaning. In contrast, `What is the Problem
   Represented to Be?' (WPR) is a method for critiquing common assumptions
   underpinning public policy by questioning unexamined knowledges. CFA is
   constructivist WPR is constructionist. Can two policy methods from
   different research paradigms be used in tandem? Scholars do not agree if
   this is possible; those who do say little about why and how to do it. I
   argue that although CFA and WPR have distinct metatheoretical
   foundations, process-oriented researchers doing single case and small n
   studies can use both in tandem to produce more rigorous, critical
   scholarship. I explain why using them in a complementary fashion is not
   only possible but also desirable and illustrate how to do it by drawing
   on examples from three dissimilar policy debates about controversial
   gender practices like veiling.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {73},

Abstract = {Political authenticity is connected to higher levels of political trust
   from electorates and can influence political outcomes, but it is often
   overlooked as a relevant factor for electoral behavior. To date,
   discussions of how authenticity appears and changes in politics
   typically remain at the theoretical level and are rarely comparative.
   This article develops a framework to identify and compare how
   authenticity is performed in political discourses over time and across
   settings by politicians. To demonstrate the usefulness of the framework,
   this article investigates authenticity performances in 21,496 political
   texts of electoral debates, interviews, campaigns, and official speeches
   by presidents and presidential candidates in Brazil and the United
   States since 1988. The findings indicate that authenticity is generally
   performed with greater frequency by presidents and presidential
   candidates in Brazil than in the United States, though authenticity
   performances are not more prevalent during election years in either
   country.},

Abstract = {Street-level organizations (SLOs) play a key, but understudied,
   political role in democratic governance as they are responsible for the
   direct-delivery of public services that are vital to the functioning of
   the state. To discuss the political role of SLOs in general, this study
   begins by identifying four SLO roles, which are conceptualized here by
   distinguishing policy-sphere versus politics-sphere and
   ``SLOs-as-takers{''} versus ``SLOs-as-makers.{''} SLOs' political role
   in a democratic backsliding and populism context is specified by
   distinguishing whether SLOs converge to, or diverge from, illiberal
   policies, and distinguishing reactive and proactive responses. Each of
   the four responses is elaborated by referring to how SLOs both
   influence, and are influenced by, populism and democratic backsliding.
   Shifting attention to the specific context of democratic erosion allows
   a more nuanced distinction between policy sectors and countries, as well
   as identifying the ways through which public service provision
   facilitates or inhibits democratic backsliding.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to establish whether, and to what extent, an increase in
   the public provision of early childhood education and care services
   (ECEC) has had a positive effect on women's participation in the labour
   market in Italy and Spain. It does so by compiling panel data using
   microdata from the European Labour Force Survey (2006-2018), together
   with secondary sources of information on public ECEC investment made in
   the two countries. After controlling for unit heterogeneity and reverse
   causality, the estimated results indicate a positive correlation with
   the employment rates of women with children and the number of hours
   worked, in particular for those without a degree, thus indicating the
   need to address unequal access to publicly-provided ECEC services.},

Abstract = {The expansion of capitalism into Africa induced significant
   transformations of African societies which have continued to influence
   what people on the continent do today. Africa's encounter with capital,
   though still limited in scope, has always been ruthless, coercive and
   violent, as displayed in the slave trade, colonial occupation and
   current neocolonial incursions. Although some political economy analysts
   have suggested that capitalism in Africa has not exploited Africans
   enough, this article shows that the encounter with capitalism on the
   continent has been, and continues to be, vicious, with its brutality
   often obscured by its stunted nature. The article draws on Lungisile
   Ntsebeza's work on land to show that engaged scholarship can play a
   critical role in unveiling the mechanisms and nature of capitalist
   exploitation and brutality in Africa, often masked by weak capitalist
   penetration. Using examples of current land struggles, it shows that
   capitalist exploitation in Africa is not only limited to those engaged
   in capitalist relations of production (wage labour) but extends to
   people outside these relations.},

Abstract = {This contribution revisits Shih's mission of relational IR and the
   Chinese relational school from the perspective of the parallel between
   quantum physics and ancient Asian philosophies, such as Buddhism and
   Daoism, asking questions about the significance of relational IR as a
   contradiction or complementarity, the nature of relational systems, and
   the role of conversation and translation in an unfolding world. It
   concludes with a reflection on time, memory and emotion as it relates to
   a past of empire.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the history and working mode of the Central
   Commission for Comprehensively Deepening Reform (CCCDR) to shed light on
   the underpinnings of `top-level design' in China's policy process. We
   demonstrate the paradoxical nature of the CCCDR's `hard steering': on
   the one hand, agenda-setting and the creation of major reform policies
   has been centralized and highly formalized; on the other hand, local
   circumstances are not adequately taken into account, resulting in low
   resource-efficiency in policy implementation. This article makes an
   important contribution to our understanding of the Chinese policy
   process under conditions of `top-level design'. By showing how political
   steering is conducted at the central level and by drawing on a case
   study, we also critically assess the CCP's governing capacity in the Xi
   Jinping era.},

Title = {When regional energy cooperation fails: learning from the struggles of
   Northeast Asia's joint oil import mechanism},
Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {37},
Number = {5},
Pages = {637-664},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {The question of why some regions reject energy cooperation initiatives
   that aim to improve their overall security of supply puzzles scholars
   and policymakers advocating for deeper regional integration through
   energy trade. This was the case in Northeast Asia, where efforts to
   create a joint oil import mechanism to improve China, South Korea and
   Japan's collective bargaining power against Middle East suppliers
   repeatedly failed and turned instead into competing bilateral contracts
   at higher prices for all three countries. This article offers two
   explanations for this puzzle. First, the unique technical challenges and
   costly logistics of establishing reliable oil and gas supply routes make
   bilateral agreements more credible than multilateral guarantees in
   regions characterised by geographical remoteness and high differential
   vulnerability to disruptions among its members. Second, the tendency of
   policymakers to securitise their country's energy supply pushes them to
   overemphasise their relative vulnerabilities and fear any loss of
   autonomy over their supplies.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) policy has been a key topic in public and
   political discourse for some time. Mobilizing Bacchi's `What's the
   problem represented to be?' framework, we critically explore the policy
   responses to AI presented by the European Commission, the problem
   representations that are assumed within and justify these particular
   responses, and the wider effects of such problematizations. We find that
   EU AI policy constitutes the technology as both opportunity and threat,
   and that these problematizations demand a specific policy response - the
   risk-based categorizations of the AI Act - that allows these different
   imaginations of AI to cohere. In addition, we argue that one effect of
   these problematizations is the enactment of particular versions of
   Europe and Europeanness. In proposing a specific policy solution,
   European AI policy enacts not only AI but an exceptionalist notion of
   Europe as a policy actor and coherent political community.},

Title = {Path-Dependent Criminality: Criminal Governance after the Paramilitary
   Demobilization in Cali and Medellin},
Journal = {COLOMBIA INTERNACIONAL},

Abstract = {Objective/context: After the paramilitary demobilization in Colombia,
   Cali and Medellin-major cities with a long history of political and
   criminal violence-saw a decline in violence despite the continuing
   operation of criminal groups. Yet, while Cali remained more violent than
   the national average, with criminal groups displaying less ability to
   regulate local affairs and security, Medellin became less violent than
   the national average and criminal groups engaged in more intensive
   governance. Methodology: I compare these cities using case studies
   constructed through fieldwork and interviews with security officials,
   NGO and social leaders, and former members of groups, drawing on my
   long-term, ongoing research engagement in both locations. Conclusions:
   The contrast between these cities exemplifies varied manifestations of
   post-conflict criminality. I argue that this variation in criminal
   governance is connected to the wartime balance of power, specifically,
   the level of territorial control and political connections armed groups
   had before the demobilization. Where control and political connections
   of paramilitary before demobilization were high, post-conflict crime
   groups were more likely to engage in governance behaviors. By contrast,
   disputed territories during wartime were likely to experience less
   criminal governance. Drawing on path dependence ideas, I introduce an
   overlooked mechanism through which wartime orders affect criminal
   behavior: learning processes inside and outside criminal groups.
   Originality: I show that to fully understand post-conflict criminality,
   it is crucial to consider armed actors peripherally involved in the war
   but essential for territorial control, whereas to understand criminal
   governance, the mid-ranks of armed groups and learning processes are
   crucial.},

Abstract = {Objective/context: To learn about the contributions of women of the
   organized Colombian diaspora in Catalonia to creating transnational
   practices in favor of peace and denunciation of human rights violations
   in Colombia. Specifically, we seek to identify the main actors,
   organizational spaces, and collective action repertoires developed by
   Colombian women in Catalonia. Therefore, we approach the literature on
   the political participation of migrant and exiled women from the
   perspective of political transnationalism. Methodology: This qualitative
   and participatory research study examines bibliographic and documentary
   sources, semi-structured interviews with Colombian women participating
   in the organized diaspora, and participant observation of mobilizations.
   Conclusions: The analysis and discussion of the results show that for
   some women, their participation is based on their exile and previous
   political involvement. For others, it is driven by the recognition of
   their condition as migrant subjects, as well as the different axes of
   inequality that cross them, which allows them to connect their
   individual discomfort with the collective discomfort of their country of
   origin and develop new interpretative frameworks and new repertoires of
   action aimed at sensitizing and influencing the Colombian
   socio-political reality. Originality: This research contribution allows
   for further debate on the transnational political role of migrations in
   a globalized world and what role women can play in it.},

Abstract = {There is increasing awareness of the gendered violence undertaken by
   incels (involuntary celibates), both online and offline. Much of the
   analysis of the phenomenon has focused on what incels mean for our
   understanding of gender, as well as the role that the internet plays in
   fostering extremist ideologies. This article instead provides a
   comparative critical frame analysis of policy responses in Sweden and
   the United Kingdom. Using critical frame analysis, research finds that
   that there is greater engagement with the topic among parliamentary
   actors in the United Kingdom than in Sweden, although there appears to
   be a clearer response in Sweden where it is subsumed within countering
   violent extremism strategies. However, neither country has developed
   specific policies to tackle the threat posed by incels; moreover, there
   are diverse policy frames at work which to some extent makes it
   difficult to create targeted policies. Theoretically, we argue that this
   absence of policy should be understood as an abdication of
   responsibility.},

Abstract = {Public servants who monitor and supervise the administrative and
   political systems must consider the extent to which they are willing to
   stretch the boundaries of their role for holding public servants
   accountable. We develop an analytical framework of the factors that
   influence the decisions of such officials, focusing on state auditors.
   Using new institutionalism, we suggest that the social, cultural, and
   political context figures more prominently in state auditors' strategic
   calculations than purely professional considerations or individual
   factors. This bottom-up perspective sheds new light on the role of such
   officials in democratic systems, and their dependence on citizens'
   awareness and active support in promoting accountability. We illustrate
   the theoretical framework using examples from Israel.},

Abstract = {What are the political implications of Chinese loans to borrowing
   countries? Our argument is that similar to other forms of international
   finance, loans from China provide leaders with additional resources to
   maintain their power. The nature of China's lending
   practices-characterized by an absence of good governance
   conditions-offers a unique advantage to political leaders, allowing
   corrupt leaders who receive loans from China to stay in power for longer
   periods. To support this argument, we conducted an analysis of a dataset
   of 115 developing countries from 2000 to 2015, focusing on the
   relationship between Chinese loans and leaders' political survival. Our
   findings indicate that Chinese loans positively impact leader survival,
   with the strongest effects observed in more corrupt regimes. To address
   endogeneity concerns, we employ a shift-share instrumentation strategy
   and several additional tests. Our analysis underscores the importance of
   Chinese lending to both international and domestic politics.},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {This conceptual article calls for the integration of new approaches to
   the study of visual populist communication, arguing that it will play a
   critical part in a new era of radical right mainstreaming. Extant
   scholarship on the mainstreaming of the radical right has focused on
   party politics and rhetoric, neglecting the visual self-presentation and
   emotional strategies of radical right leaders on platforms like
   Instagram and TikTok. The article proposes the novel concept of `visual
   de-demonisation' to capture these dynamics, articulating it as a
   three-fold strategy that emphasises the legitimacy, good character and
   ample policy platform of radical right leaders on visual social media.
   The article also argues that visual platforms provide the radical right
   with the ideal setting to present itself in a renewed and more positive
   light, hence serving its strategic interest in de-demonising. This poses
   a key challenge for the future, potentially contributing to its
   increased normalisation.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {539-553},

Abstract = {The climate crisis prompted the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an
   international lender of last resort, to implement wholesale reforms to
   incorporate climate policy into its operations. At the IMF, selected
   countries from the Global North-historically the largest emitters of
   greenhouse gases-dominate decision-making. This raises several
   questions. Can the Fund implement an ambitious and effective climate
   policy? How are climate-vulnerable developing countries and their
   interests represented in everyday decision-making at the institution?
   Drawing on scholarship on the political economy and legitimacy of
   international organizations, we focus on the formal distribution of
   decision-making power within the IMF to evaluate the IMF's shift toward
   climate change. Our empirical analysis of the representation of 57
   self-identifying climate-vulnerable developing countries (the V20) at
   the IMF and within its Executive Board shows that these countries,
   speaking for almost a third of the Fund's membership, command a vote
   share of merely 5.6\%. Our assessment of the Climate Strategy adopted by
   the IMF amplifies equity concerns over its climate policies and further
   attests to the disregard of requests by developing countries. Barring
   meaningful governance reform to increase the voice and representation of
   climate-vulnerable developing countries, the IMF's approach to
   addressing climate change is unlikely to translate into legitimate and
   effective climate policy.},

Abstract = {For more than a decade, the European Union (EU) has been pursuing
   normalisation in Kosovo-Serbia relations. However, the EU has not
   focused on tackling the core issues of the conflict. Instead, EU
   mediators prioritised a gradual normalisation of relations based on an
   expectation of genuine conflict resolution to follow in the future. We
   argue, though, that the relationship between normalisation and conflict
   resolution is not straightforward. Considering the Kosovo Serb
   perspective, we show that the EU efforts have created a situation of
   managed instability in Kosovo, adding in some cases new layers to the
   conflict instead of resolving it.},

Title = {Analyzing the rhetoric of contemporary BSMRSTU student movements:
   manifestations and social implications in Gopalganj, Bangladesh},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {Background The rich tapestry of student politics and movements in
   Bangladesh is marked by a history of significant contributions to the
   country's sociopolitical landscape. This study was prompted by a keen
   interest in exploring the dynamics of contemporary student movements at
   Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University
   (BSMRSTU), Gopalganj, and their interplay with the broader
   sociopolitical climate of Bangladesh. A critical examination of these
   movements reveals a complex web of motivations, strategies, and outcomes
   that both mirror and influence national sociopolitical dialogues.Methods
   Employing qualitative research methods, including in-depth interviews
   (IDI) with 26 individuals directly affected by the culture and mechanics
   of these movements, this study uncovers the nuanced ways in which
   student activism at BSMRSTU mobilizes cultural ideologies toward
   societal change. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were
   utilized to select participants, revealing that the rhetoric of
   movements-framed around justice, rights, equality, and reform-plays a
   crucial role in recruiting and energizing participants.Results However,
   this investigation also highlights a darker facet of these movements:
   the destructive consequences of specific actions, such as property
   damage, which not only impact the immediate community but also fuel
   further unrest. The prevalence of movements centered on themes of
   injustice underscores the urgent need for both governmental and academic
   institutions to engage more constructively with student concerns.
   Addressing this gap requires a nuanced understanding of the motivations
   behind student movements and a commitment to implementing policies that
   nurture a culture of dialogue and reform.Conclusion This study,
   therefore, problematizes the contemporary student movements at BSMRSTU
   by questioning the balance between activism and the potential for
   unintended consequences, urging a reevaluation of how such movements are
   perceived and managed in the context of Bangladesh's evolving
   sociopolitical milieu. For harmful movement culture in academia to be
   prevented, government and university authorities must take student
   movements seriously and implement policies and strong norms.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the Soviet grand narrative of the Great
   Patriotic War (1941-45) was used in the school educational institution
   in one of the two Donbas ``people's republics{''} between 2014 and 2021.
   Using as a case study a Luhansk school with one of the most pro-Russian
   and pro-occupation administrations, it explores which GPW sub-narratives
   were present in the school discourse of extracurricular activities,
   described in the school VKontakte online community. This article employs
   the elements of discourse analysis to assess visual and verbal texts,
   published by the school administration, which depict how schoolchildren
   engage in different Soviet-military contexts, celebrating,
   commemorating, or learning about GPW-related events. The article
   concludes that although the school administration incorporated the main
   Soviet narratives of the Great Patriotic War, present in contemporary
   Russian education, it also employed two regional GPW sub-narratives,
   which provide the Luhansk ``republican{''} authorities with the local
   ideological foundation for militarizing the school youth. The article
   demonstrates that such militarization of the semiformal school setting
   is linked with the Russian educational policy and has implications on
   how pupils of different ages see the social reality and their role in
   it.},

Abstract = {This article aims at analyzing the role of the two main Churches in
   Hungary (i.e., Roman Catholic, and Reformed) in support-ing Viktor Orban
   and his illiberal (or Christian) democracy. After having described the
   political frame preceding and following his first (1998-2002) and second
   (2010-2014) elections as prime minister, the transformation of Fidesz in
   his personal party and the growing importance of cultural Christianity
   in his discourse, the work will focus on his intellectual and
   ideological (if any) grounding, on how it is spelled. The last two
   para-graphs sketch Hungary's recent Church(es) history and their
   relations with Fidesz to understand whether there are continuities or
   ruptures favoring or impeding compromises with the regime and whether
   religious dissent exists.},

Abstract = {Introduction: This study aims to understand the dominant factors of
   political marketing strategies to influence voters in the national and
   state elections in India. To identify them, we have reviewed literature
   of different nations (both developed and developing) across the world
   and India. Methods: We have defined specific criteria and search terms
   to first identify the relevant studies that have focused on the
   influencing factors in the global and Indian political marketing
   landscape. After identifying these factors, we gleaned the key takeaways
   in terms of the influencing factors from all those studies and discussed
   the different emerging trends of shifting power from party brand to
   leadership brand in the national elections. We have also analyzed the
   impact of different factors such as party leader or candidate's
   personality, party policy and ideology, use of social media as a
   campaigning tool, and campaign messaging and platform on the national
   and state elections over the years Results and discussions: We found
   that for the national elections, partly leadership and use of social
   media are critical factors, while for the state elections, party policy
   and ideology with on-ground campaigns have a significant influence on
   voters.},

Abstract = {This study examines how inheritance and gift taxation, in combination
   with gendered parental transfer behavior, exacerbate gender wealth
   inequalities. Tax systems can help reproduce gender differences if men
   and women benefit differently from tax exemptions. This might happen
   when men and women receive different types of assets, only some of which
   are tax exempt. To investigate gendered parental transfer behavior and
   gendered tax rates, we draw on German administrative data on inheritance
   and gift taxation. Women are less likely than men to receive parental
   transfers, the value of such transfers tend to be lower, and women tend
   to receive different types of asset. Moreover, we identify a gender tax
   gap of 2\% for inheritances and 22\% for gifts. Our analyses suggest
   that men benefit more from tax exemptions on business assets. This study
   adds the tax system as another factor implicated in the reproduction of
   gender wealth inequalities.},

Abstract = {This paper re-evaluates conventional Institutional Analysis and
   Development (IAD) scholarship which has traditionally prioritized the
   study of specific rules configurations and their role in forming
   effective institutional arrangements. We suggest that effective
   institutional governance may actually be more reliant on the narrative
   foundations and personal cognitive interpretations of these rules than
   on the explicit rules themselves. By drawing insights from the Narrative
   Policy Framework (NPF), which delves into the internal cognitive
   processes of individuals, we seek to enrich the understanding of
   institutional-actor-rule dynamics. We contend that policy actors often
   rely on narrative heuristics to navigate complex institutional
   landscapes, underscoring the role of narratives in both understanding
   institutional structures and instigating collective action. Although
   institutional scholarship recognizes the centrality of communication,
   its impact on shaping institutional arrangements and rule formation
   remains insufficiently explored. This paper advocates for the
   integration of the NPF and the Institutional Grammar Tools' (IGT) ADICO,
   identifying potential parallels between the two frameworks. Our
   preliminary theorization suggests a cyclical relationship between
   narratives and institutions, with narratives shaping and being shaped by
   institutional rules and norms. Building upon Narrative Attention Theory,
   we aim to understand the broader implications of institutional
   narratives in driving or reinforcing policy stasis. Our paper represents
   a foundational step toward a comprehensive theoretical framework on the
   role of narratives in institutions, spotlighting institutional rules and
   pointing to future research directions. Through the proposed integration
   of NPF and IGT's ADICO, we hope to provide a more nuanced understanding
   of narrative dynamics in institutional arrangements and pave the way for
   empirical exploration of this relationship.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the challenges and complexities navigated and
   negotiated in public facing counter-terrorism strategic communication
   campaigns. Informed by frame analysis of campaign assets, practitioner
   interviews and public focus groups, the discussion pivots around three
   high-profile UK public messaging campaigns. Building from Goffman's
   theory of ``normal appearances{''} and the established concept of a
   ``frame trap{''}, the analysis identifies two further shaping tensions.
   A ``fear trap{''} occurs when counter-terrorism messages seek to
   ``outbid{''} other risks in order to capture public attention, thereby
   unintentionally creating the negative emotional reactions sought through
   acts of terrorism, or overly-reassuring messages that induce public
   disengagement. In contrast, a ``fame trap{''} results from creating
   ``too much{''} public awareness of terrorism, by using commercial
   marketing logics. In practice, frame, fame and fear traps overlap and
   interact across different contexts, and the analysis uses the concept of
   a dialectic of anomaly and normality to highlight implications for
   future scholarship and practice.},

Title = {Advancing collaborative social outcomes through place-based
   solutions-aligning policy and funding systems},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 18},
Abstract = {More collaborative and human-centered approaches to tackle social
   problems of entrenched disadvantage have been introduced in many
   countries, including Australia, but with mixed results. Traditional
   programs that reinforce existing political and bureaucratic processes
   have been seen as blockers to collaborative modes of policymaking,
   governance, and delivery. Drawing on collaborative governance
   perspectives, this paper reports new research undertaken in conjunction
   with a not-for-profit organization (Collaboration for Impact) involved
   in supporting place-based collaborative community change efforts.
   Research findings, based on stakeholder perspectives, highlight not only
   the potential benefits of a more collaborative model (i.e., placed-based
   and community driven) but also the significant unresolved challenges for
   ``backbone{''} coordination bodies, which have recently been established
   to achieve more ``joined-up{''} policy, funding, and service delivery
   arrangements. The paper concludes by proposing a practice-driven focus
   on policy and funding systems, together with implications for policy
   learning and program design.},

Abstract = {The persistence of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict profoundly
   influences the perceptions of both Israelis and Palestinians, shaping
   successive generations and posing a complex challenge for security
   scholarship. This article examines these contrasting socially
   constructed realities through the lens of Securitisation Theory,
   analysing public social media discourses on Facebook between 1 January
   2021 and 29 April 2022 in Israel and the Palestinian Territories. By
   bridging high-level theorising with empirically driven methodology, the
   study enriches the understanding of securitisation processes using
   Balzacq's framework and engaging with perspectives from Cote, Stritzel,
   and Vuori, including the active role of target audiences and the
   complexity of securitisation as a speech act. Through this approach, the
   research not only advances theoretical insights into Securitisation but
   also demonstrates that leveraging social media analysis provides both a
   valuable means of theory testing and a more comprehensive understanding
   of securitisation dynamics in the Israeli-Palestinian context.},

Abstract = {African Studies is characterised by intellectual contestations and
   epistemic struggles. These have become accentuated in the context of the
   current resurgent and insurgent decolonisation of the twenty-first
   century. This article delineates and reflects on 10 challenges
   confronting reconfiguring African Studies, namely genealogical,
   epistemic, linguistic, chronological, theoretical, spatial (area
   studies, country studies), androcentric, disciplinary, canonical issues
   and resilience of colonial library. These challenges are posed as part
   of comfort zones (asserted and reasserted truth/common notions) in doing
   African Studies that have to be changed in accordance with demands for a
   decolonised African Studies.},

Abstract = {Processes of gendered exploitation within villages are integral to
   world-historical capitalism. Analysing them informs pathways to change.
   This article illustrates three forms of `everyday exploitation':
   `direct' exploitation of labour by petty capital, `indirect'
   exploitation through petty commodity production, and the `triple
   exploitation' of labouring class women through the interplay of
   capitalism and patriarchy. This is done through detailed data on class,
   gender and generational relations within agriculture and brickmaking in
   an Ugandan village facing a `neo-colonial absence' of public services.
   Increasing out-migration, meanwhile, underlines a growing crisis of
   simple reproduction amid pauperising petty commodity production and
   scarce wage-labour.},

Abstract = {The Australian continent has over 6500 edible endemic plant species,
   fourteen of which have been certified for commercial consumption. This
   paper seeks to critically analyze select Australian Commonwealth
   Government policy relating to these Aboriginal plant foods. The aim is
   to purposefully examine the positioning of non-Indigenous people in
   Aboriginal plant foods policy discourse and reveal tacit settler
   colonial power relations. This is in response to a call to action from
   Indigenous scholars to examine how settler colonialism manifests in
   regulatory mechanisms, such as government policy. This paper offers a
   theoretically informed critical discourse analysis methodology for
   examining Australian Commonwealth Government policy relating to
   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. Analysis comprised an
   explanation of the socio-political context of Aboriginal policymaking in
   Australia, textual analysis of policy texts related to Aboriginal plant
   foods and an interpretation of discourse practice to reveal how policy
   discourse tacitly promotes ideological agendas. This analysis revealed
   that Australian Commonwealth Government Aboriginal plant foods policy is
   framed according to settler terms and upholds neoliberal interests.
   Considerable rethinking is required about how power is exercised in
   Commonwealth Government policy relating to Aboriginal plant foods to
   ensure it does not replicate and perpetuate unjust settler colonial
   power relations.},

Abstract = {This article considers the context, development, and significance of the
   Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023 . The Act was relatively
   unusual in aiming to increase the normative strength of freedom of
   speech. The central justification given for the Act was the need to
   respond to an increasing number of interferences with free speech and
   academic freedom occurring at universities. The growth of a ``cancel
   culture{''} was having a ``chilling effect{''} on students, staff, and
   visiting speakers. The article examines a range of high -profile cases
   and incidents that have attracted political and media attention. Many of
   these have concerned contemporary debates related to trans issues and
   identity politics. The issues discussed in the article are of wider
   international interest. Similar controversies have been experienced in
   universities in other states. The article makes comparative reference to
   developments in the field in the United States, Canada, Australia, and
   New Zealand. The article examines the perceived issues and evidential
   bases for the Act, reviews the legal duties, and analyzes the key legal
   concepts. It considers these in terms of compatibility with the European
   Convention on Human Rights (1950). It concludes by addressing three
   thematic issues: (i) a Model Code; (ii) challenging university
   ideologies; and (iii) securing cultural change.},

Abstract = {Can corruption scandals trigger citizens to punish a poor-performing
   government? Citizens often fail to punish governments with subpar policy
   outcomes because they tend to isolate politics from their personal life
   and avoid blaming one's own party. Challenging these popular beliefs,
   our findings from a survey experiment in South Korea indicate that
   corruption scandals accusing elected officials of nepotism trigger
   people to blame the government as the cause of their personal
   grievances. This effect is prominent among individuals who are highly
   worried about their own education, employment, and retirement,
   highlighting anxiety as a driving factor. Surprisingly, the effect of
   nepotism spills across domains; for example, college admission nepotism
   increases government blame for concerns on not only education but also
   employment and retirement. Moreover, nepotism may prompt partisans whose
   party is in power, who are otherwise less likely to blame the incumbent
   government, to attribute greater blame to the government. These findings
   imply that corruption scandals can alter perceptions of how government
   performance affects personal lives. Overall, the study suggests that
   nepotism in areas critical to personal well-being may generate an
   effective opposition against poor-performing government, as seen in the
   2016-17 South Korean presidential corruption scandal.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for agile governance to
   effectively address and prevent future global crises. Scholars have
   examined China's grid system and its application by local governments in
   controlling the spread of COVID-19. Our research supports these
   findings, and we further argue that the grid system enhances
   responsiveness, inclusiveness, and transparency in governance, thereby
   benefiting both the government and its citizens. Through a detailed case
   study of grid governance in the M District of Shanghai from July 2020 to
   August 2022, we explore the operational mechanisms of the grid system.
   By incorporating the safety valve theory, we propose that the community
   grid, the smallest administrative unit in China, functions as an
   institution to issue pre-emptive warnings, integrate communities, and
   alleviate pressures during times of crisis, contributing to governance
   agility. As grid governance has constantly been strengthened, this
   research not only advances our comprehension of the effectiveness of
   grassroots governance in China, but also offers valuable insights
   pertaining to crisis management in mega-cities worldwide.},

Abstract = {In this study, we employ a critical political economy framework for an
   empirical analysis of environmental withdrawals from agricultural
   production in Latin America. Namely, we focus on the role of
   export-orientation and trade direction of food as drivers of cropland
   footprint expansion in (semi-)periphery countries. Following the
   literature on the treadmill of production, ecological unequal exchange,
   and extractivism, we reason that (semi-)peripheries are structured to
   produce agricultural primary goods that rely on expansionary cropland
   dynamics. To test this claim, we utilize a panel study of fourteen
   countries in Latin America from 1970 to 2016. We collected data from the
   World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Global Footprints
   Network. Results from the study show that export-orientation and trade
   direction have a positive relationship with the dependent variable,
   cropland footprint. The results confirm the basic model presented by
   critical political economy, that (semi-)peripheries are structured
   toward increasing environmental withdrawals as a part of their
   agricultural production.Este estudio emplea un marco critico de economia
   politica para realizar un analisis empirico de las formas de extraccion
   de recursos naturales en la produccion agricola de America Latina. Nos
   centramos en el papel propulsor que juegan la orientacion hacia la
   exportacion y la direccion comercial de los alimentos en la expansion y
   huella ecologica de las tierras de cultivo en paises
   (semi)perifericos.Basandonos en la literatura que analiza el espiral de
   la produccion, el intercambio ecologico desigual y el extractivismo,
   sugerimos que las (semi)periferias han sido estructuradas para producir
   bienes agricolas primarios que dependen de la dinamica expansiva de las
   tierras de cultivo. Para probar esta afirmacion, utilizamos un estudio
   de panel de catorce paises de America Latina desde 1970 hasta
   2016.Recopilamos datos del Banco Mundial, el Fondo Monetario
   Internacional y la Red Global de la Huella Ecologica. Los resultados del
   estudio muestran que la orientacion hacia la exportacion y la direccion
   del comercio tienen una relacion positiva con la variable dependiente,
   la huella ecologica que dejan las tierras de cultivo. Los resultados
   tambien confirman la existencia del modelo basico sugerido por la
   economia politica critica, segun el cual la estructura de las
   (semi)periferias se encuentra dirigida hacia el aumento de la extraccion
   ambiental como parte de su produccion agricola.},

Abstract = {Stigmatizing behavior and a lack of supportive behavior can act as a
   barrier to successfully reintegrating terrorist offenders, potentially
   resulting in reoffending. As such, there have been several efforts to
   understand how to build community support for reintegration of terrorist
   offenders, for example through community engagement or messaging from
   trusted authorities. Research on the drivers of community support for
   reintegrating criminal offenders further suggests the perceived
   redeemability of an offender is significant at overcoming stigmatization
   and promoting support for rehabilitation and re-entry into society. In
   this study, we deploy an experimental survey design to isolate the
   causal effect of information which signals offender redeemability and
   then analyze its effect on four measures of supportive and stigmatizing
   behavior toward a terrorist offender. We also examine the individual
   characteristics of those more or less likely to report supportive or
   stigmatizing behaviors toward the reintegrating offender. The findings
   show that signaling redeemability decreases one measure of stigmatizing
   behavior and increases one measure of supportive behavior. While trusted
   messengers may be important in building community support for
   reintegration, our findings demonstrate the salience of communicating
   that an offender has completed a rehabilitation program, even among
   audiences typically opposed to reintegration.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe objective of this paper is to examine the profound
   repercussions of workplace bullying (WB), emotional exhaustion (EE), and
   psychological distress (PD) on poor job performance (PJP) within the
   intricacies of Thailand's healthcare sector. It also seeks to elucidate
   the moderating influence of COVID-19 burnout (CBO) on these
   variables.Design/methodology/approachThis paper utilized a quantitative
   research approach. A total of 230 responses were collected from
   healthcare workers using convenience sampling during a significant surge
   of the coronavirus in March 2022. To assess the reliability and
   correlations between constructs, a dual-stage structural equation
   modeling (SEM) technique was applied.FindingsDuring the global health
   crisis caused by COVID-19, WB and PD were found to positively predict
   PJP, except for EE. The presence of WB elevated EE and PD among Thai
   hospital staff. PD and EE partially mediated the relationship between WB
   and PJP. The positive moderating role of CBO among hospital employees
   significantly buffered the relationship between WB and
   EE.Originality/valueThe originality of this study lies in the
   examination of the poor mental health of Thai healthcare workers during
   the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare reforms are required to protect the
   mental health of Thai healthcare staff to prevent poor job performance
   following unprecedented circumstances.},

Abstract = {Policy capacity is described as a determinant for effective policy
   implementation. Its contents vary according to modes of governance.
   Based on available academic studies, grey literature, and
   semi-structured interviews, this study empirically explores how urban
   village redevelopment has been carried out in two cities, Hangzhou and
   Guangzhou, through the lens of policy capacity. By contrasting policy
   outcomes and the manifestation of policy capacity at different levels in
   these two cities, we develop three arguments that contribute to our
   understanding of urban renewal and policy capacity. Firstly, the
   performance of any policy action is affected by the capacity of the
   central actor to develop and implement policies. Secondly, understanding
   the interactive logical between analytical, operational, and political
   capacities under different governance modes is the key to understanding
   the strengths and weaknesses of policy capacity in a specific sector.
   Shaped by local contexts and past experience, local governments are
   predisposed to path dependence in developing and deploying policy
   capacity in urban village redevelopment. Thirdly, the capabilities and
   resources needed to support policies are largely determined by policy
   problematization at the analytical level: the technique-based approach
   of policy capacity theory needs to complete the missing link between
   policy framing and ethical issues.},

   decarbonise. Meanwhile, resource-rich countries stand to benefit from
   the rush for `energy-transition minerals'. Here, institutional investors
   and governments promote climate policies compatible with natural
   resource extraction. This begs the question: How have extractive
   conglomerates reorganised their interests to benefit from the energy
   transition? Focusing on the nickel extraction to lithium battery to EV
   industry in Indonesia, this article contends that the intersection of
   decarbonisation, developmentalism, and resource nationalism offer
   extractive capital an `EV-fix' for declining legitimacy. This is more
   than an ideological shift, as new alliances of state capital, domestic
   conglomerates, politicians and international battery and EV
   manufacturers are forged under a `green development-resource nationalist
   nexus'.},

Abstract = {In governance theory, there is a crucial theoretical conundrum of
   meta-governance: how can meta-governors simultaneously stay outside of
   the governed network while also being embedded within it, and
   appropriately apply hands-off and hands-on strategies? The heterogeneous
   experiences of governance practices in non-Western contexts may help to
   explore this issue. The paper examines the `Starfish Project'(haixing
   jihua), a volunteer action aimed at improving the incomes of rural
   residents in mountainous areas of H District in N City, China, against
   the backdrop of promoting common prosperity. This initiative involves
   non-profit organizations, market actors, and government agencies,
   forming a multi-order meta-governance system. In this system, the
   government acts as a second-order meta-governor. It provides shared
   values, norms, and objectives, for the social network, thereby
   conferring institutional legitimacy upon the social network and its
   activities. Meanwhile, a non-profit organization operates as a
   first-order meta-governor within the network, and leverages market-based
   mechanisms to continuously incentivize network members, foster network
   interaction, and facilitate conflict resolution. The multi-order
   meta-governance model provides a potential solution to the dilemma.
   However, it is important to note that this may not yet be a definitive
   solution to the conundrum.},

Title = {The democratising capacity of new municipalism: beyond direct democracy
   in public- common partnerships},

Abstract = {New municipalism, in its endeavour to democratise urban politics and
   policy, employs innovative strategies including public-common
   partnerships, which seek to support citizens in self -managing public
   goods and services. Proponents of new municipalism claim that these
   partnerships have a democratising capacity, as self -management is seen
   as an expression of direct democracy. In this article we examine this
   democratising capacity. By adopting an abductive methodology, the
   article analyses a case of a public-common partnership, the Citizen
   Assets programme promoted by Barcelona en Comu in Barcelona, Spain. The
   research findings show that the Citizen Assets programme does have a
   democratising capacity. However, democratisation is not achieved
   exclusively through self -management, which itself needs to be
   democratised, but by integrating different modalities of democratisation
   into the policy process, namely co -production and democratic control.
   Theorising this integration as a `non -appropriable' form of policy
   making, the article makes an original contribution to research on
   democratisation in the context of a specific new municipalism-inspired
   policy programme.},

Title = {Economic Globalization's Polycrisis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {In this article, I suggest that economic globalization is experiencing a
   particularly serious kind of crisis: a ``polycrisis.{''} Use of this
   term has proliferated recently but with many meanings. I propose that it
   be defined as a cluster of distinct crises that interact in ways that
   they and/or their effects tend to reinforce each other. This core
   definition enables the identification of distinct types of polycrises
   that capture multiple uses of the term to date. These types vary
   according to the spatiality, temporality, and level of generality of
   each polycrisis as well as the traits of its constituent crises. The
   analytical utility of the term, when defined in this way, is to
   encourage scholars to analyze interconnections between different kinds
   of crises across various issue areas and to reject monocausal analyses
   of crisis clusters they study. Applying this understanding of the
   concept to the study of economic globalization, I focus on five
   constituent crises that are contributing to its current polycrisis. This
   application of the term highlights yet another type of polycrisis,
   illustrating the importance of the conceptual issues raised above. The
   article concludes with some cautions about efforts to predict economic
   globalization's future and about ways in which polycrisis discourse may
   serve political projects.
   En este articulo, sugerimos que la globalizacion economica esta pasando
   por un tipo de crisis particularmente grave: una << policrisis >>. El
   uso de este termino ha proliferado recientemente, pero con muchos
   significados diferentes. Proponemos que deberia definirse como un
   conjunto de crisis distintas que interactuan de manera que ellas y/o sus
   efectos tienden a reforzarse mutuamente. Esta definicion basica permite
   la identificacion de distintos tipos de policrisis que capturan los
   multiples usos que ha tenido el termino hasta la fecha. Estos tipos
   varian de acuerdo con la espacialidad, la temporalidad y el nivel de
   generalidad de cada policrisis, asi como con los rasgos de las crisis
   que las componen. La utilidad analitica del termino, cuando se define de
   esta manera, consiste en alentar a los academicos a analizar las
   interconexiones existentes entre diferentes tipos de crisis en diversas
   areas tematicas y a rechazar las explicaciones monocausales de los
   grupos de crisis que estudian. Aplicamos esta comprension del concepto
   al estudio de la globalizacion economica con el fin de centrarnos en
   cinco crisis constituyentes que estan contribuyendo a su actual
   policrisis. Esta aplicacion del termino pone de relieve otro tipo mas de
   policrisis, lo que ilustra la importancia de las cuestiones conceptuales
   planteadas anteriormente. El articulo concluye con algunas advertencias
   sobre los esfuerzos por predecir el futuro de la globalizacion economica
   y sobre las formas mediante la cuales el discurso de la policrisis puede
   servir a los proyectos politicos.
   Dans cet article, j'affirme que la mondialisation economique connait
   actuellement un type de crise particulierement grave : une << polycrise
   >>. Recemment, ce terme s'emploie de plus en plus, mais avec des
   acceptions differentes. Je propose de le definir comme un ensemble de
   crises distinctes qui interagissent de maniere a ce qu'elles et/ou leurs
   effets tendent a se renforcer mutuellement. Cette definition permet
   principalement d'identifier les divers types de polycrises qui
   correspondent a differents usages du terme a ce jour. Ces types varient
   en fonction de la spatialite, de la temporalite et du niveau de
   generalite de chaque polycrise ainsi que des traits de ses crises
   constitutives. L'utilite analytique du terme, quand il est defini de
   cette facon, est d'encourager les chercheurs a analyser les
   interconnexions entre les divers types de crises dans differents
   domaines problematiques et de rejeter les explications monocausales des
   ensembles de crises qu'ils etudient. En appliquant cette facon
   d'apprehender le concept a l'etude de la mondialisation economique, je
   me concentre sur cinq crises constitutives qui contribuent a sa
   polycrise actuelle. Cette application du terme met en lumiere un nouveau
   type de polycrise, ce qui montre l'importance des problematiques
   conceptuelles abordees plus tot. L'article se clot sur des
   avertissements concernant les efforts de prediction de l'avenir de la
   mondialisation economique et les facons dont le discours de polycrise
   pourrait servir des projets politiques.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do countries lose their status as the leading
   global financial center? Some scholars argue that such shifts follow
   shortly after transitions in the distribution of other key capabilities
   (e.g. GDP), while others argue that path dependence or other more
   bespoke capabilities might be able to sustain financial leadership long
   after decline in other capabilities. This paper aims to understand the
   causes of the Anglo-American financial transition. I argue that the
   ability to manage political risk for investors is critical to the
   position of countries as financial entrepots. In the case of British
   financial leadership, I argue that Britain's position as an entrepot
   hinged on its power projection capability, which enabled Britain to
   limit political risk for investors in ways that other states could not
   replicate. The gradual loss of those capabilities, in turn, saw Britain
   eventually become overshadowed by the United States. I support my claims
   with a TERGM analysis of the interwar sovereign debt network.},

Abstract = {While some studies show ideological asymmetry in outgroup bias between
   rightists and leftists, those studies often target an ideologically
   biased outgroup. Here, we bypass this issue by targeting the ideological
   outgroups (rightists for leftists, and leftists for rightists). We rely
   on a magnetoencephalography-based approach delineating function-specific
   neural mechanisms to test for ideological asymmetries at multiple
   levels: explicit psychological self-reports, implicit behavioral bias,
   and neural oscillations. Using a computational model balancing the
   stimuli and screening 81 rightists and leftist Israeli individuals, we
   find ideological asymmetry with rightists being more biased at all three
   levels. Furthermore, the neural results add important insights by
   uncovering two underlying mechanisms: The first (late beta-band motor
   activity) is strongly associated with implicit behavior, while the
   second (early alpha-band dorsal anterior cingulate activity) reveal an
   antileftist bias for both groups. We discuss implications of the
   findings on bias, ideological asymmetry, their neural underpinnings, and
   social norms.},

Abstract = {Since the devastating 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai, and especially
   with the rise of hardline Hindu nationalism under Prime Minister
   Narendra Modi, a consensus has evolved in India that its failure to
   respond forcefully to the attack diminished its national security.
   Trumpeting assertiveness and underplaying restraint have strengthened
   Modi's electoral position, indoctrinated most of India's foreign and
   security establishment, and energised India's foreign brand. But space
   has shrunk for public advocacy and discussion of restraint. As India's
   economy continues to grow, Modi's aggressive statecraft will pose a
   dilemma. While India's means of implementing it will become more potent,
   it will have more to lose from the instability it can cause.},

Title = {`J'accuse!': whistleblowing, critical citizenship and the EU directive
   on whistleblowers' protection},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {46},
Number = {4},
Pages = {477-497},
Month = {MAY 18},
Abstract = {Despite the enactment of legislation on public interest disclosures,
   whistleblowers still face significant retaliation. Perceptions and
   expectations of loyalty to a firm, organisation or a government continue
   to be seen as antithetical to `voice', that is, the disclosure of
   wrongdoing, thereby triggering strategies of organisational exit and
   punishment. Real change can occur if whistleblowing is elevated to a
   civic duty of equal importance to other civic duties, such as to protect
   and defend the rule of law, human rights and democracy and to report
   suspected criminality to authorities. In this article, I justify
   whistleblowing on a good citizenship concept which transcends particular
   national institutional characteristics and critically examine the
   content and contribution of the European Union's Directive on
   Whistleblower protection. By deploying a tripartite lens blending
   analytical questions and a discoursive theoretical perspective with a
   comparative assessment of instruments in the Member States and the EU,
   the discussion makes the case for the urgent change in the culture of
   punitive treatment of whistleblowers in the European Union and for
   further institutional reform when the Directive is reviewed in the
   future.},

   exploring the impact of policy ideas on policy-making},

Year = {2024},

Abstract = {In the policy world, the idea of ideational robustness deals with why
   and how policy elements can be maintained over time and the implications
   this has for government strategy and activity. Past approaches to ideas
   and their influence on public policy stressed the disparate roles of
   multiple policy mechanisms such as path dependency or the nature of
   policy networks in either driving policy change forward or ensuring
   persistence of a policy. Ideational robustness on the other hand allows
   for the possibility of some changes occurring in policy environments and
   components while motivating cognitive and normative policy ideas are
   adapted and retained. While ideational persistence has often been
   identified as a source of policy stability, the possibility that some
   ideas allow lesser or greater levels of change in policy components
   while basic policy content remains more or less intact (ideational
   robustness) is much less well understood. The article reviews the
   literature on policy change and stability which highlights the influence
   of different policy processes on overall policy dynamics and the role
   played by policy learning in promoting ideational robustness. Using
   evidence from military doctrines and procurement in Canada and
   Australia, the study finds that the two countries drew different defence
   policy lessons from the end of the Cold War which contributed heavily to
   the extent of robustness of their defence policy ideas. The case studies
   show that ideational robustness is important but also that its study
   must be combined with that of other policy mechanisms and processes in
   order to explain overall policy change patterns.},

Abstract = {Military spending data measure key international relations concepts such
   as balancing, arms races, the distribution of power, and the severity of
   military burdens. Unfortunately, missing values and measurement error
   threaten the validity of existing findings. Addressing this challenge,
   we introduce the Global Military Spending Dataset (GMSD). GMSD collates
   new and existing expenditure variables from a comprehensive collection
   of sources, expands data coverage, and employs a latent variable model
   to estimate missing values and quantify measurement error. We validate
   the data and present new findings. First, correlations between economic
   surplus and military spending are currently higher than at any point in
   the last two-hundred years. Second, updating DiGiuseppe and Poast's
   (2018) analysis, we find larger substantive effects. Specifically, we
   find that the (negative) effect of a democratic ally on military
   spending is three times larger, and the (positive) effect of an increase
   in GDP is five times larger than previously estimated.},

Abstract = {Current literature on online criminal and deviant groups recognizes the
   role of online forums in the transfer of knowledge and socialization of
   members, but debates on the role of the Internet in the socialization
   and radicalization processes in the context of online extremist groups.
   This study contributes to the discussion by examining online
   radicalization process through the use of social learning theory and
   social network analysis. This innovation allows for assessment on the
   impact of online interactions with forum members on radicalization
   process. Findings found strong support of differential association and
   differential reinforcement, but showed the possibility of other
   mechanisms, such as self-radicalization, at play. Findings from the
   study highlight the need to for theory integration, the inclusion of
   online peer association, and replication to address the complex
   phenomenon of online radicalization.},

Abstract = {Widespread tax evasion and avoidance have recently led to both
   significant reforms of international tax governance and increased
   attention from theorists of global tax justice. Against the background
   of an analysis of the double challenge of effectiveness and distribution
   facing the taxation of multinational enterprises, this paper puts
   forward a taxonomy of recent contributions of the tax justice
   literature. This taxonomy not only opens up an original angle of
   interpretation on global tax justice, but also provides a vantage point
   from which to evaluate recent reforms by the Organisation for Economic
   Co-operation and Development.},

Abstract = {Does the regime type of a foreign state supporter of a resistance
   movement influence violent repression by domestic states facing
   resistance? Studies on resistance movements have recently begun to
   explore the effects of third-party support on the behaviors and
   successes of the movements themselves and the governments they oppose.
   While this literature has unearthed important findings on the impact of
   external interventions on behalf of resistance groups, one area of
   research that remains unexplored is how the political features of
   third-party actors shape the behavior of governments that face
   resistance movements. This study investigates how the domestic political
   characteristics of foreign supporters of resistance movements affect the
   repressive behaviors of domestic states facing resistance. Looking
   specifically at the regime type of foreign state supporters of
   opposition groups, we argue that resistance movements that receive
   assistance from democratic foreign states deter domestic governments
   facing resistance from using violent repression. Such governments
   recognize the selection effects associated with democratic intervention
   and the reputational costs associated with human rights practices and
   thus, they are less likely to commit physical violence against
   dissidents. Our findings for resistance campaigns during the period of
   1981-2013 support our expectations that external support from democratic
   states for resistance movements reduces the likelihood of domestic
   governments facing resistance using violent repression against dissident
   groups.},

Abstract = {Daily decisions taken by public service professionals such as social
   workers may directly impact their client's rights, especially if they
   are working in a law and policy context that is questionable in human
   rights terms. This article takes a novel approach by exploring what
   human rights roles are attributed to public service professionals by
   United Nations (UN) Treaty Bodies and UN Special Rapporteurs. The
   analysis reveals that the narrow conceptualization of human rights roles
   offered by (interpretations of) international human rights law may in
   fact diminish the potential of public service professionals to make a
   real contribution to human rights realization.},

Abstract = {Organizational research has revealed considerable variation in
   immigrant-native pay inequalities across workplace contexts. However,
   less is known about how broader labor market institutions intersect in
   the local dynamics of wage setting between employees of immigrant and
   native backgrounds. We argue that union density and higher shares of
   employees in licensed occupations in workplaces constrain organizational
   opportunity structures for unequal pay according to immigrant
   backgrounds. Our analysis of longitudinal linked employer-employee
   administrative data for the Norwegian labor market shows that the wage
   gap between immigrants and natives decreases with increasing workplace
   unionization, but almost exclusively for immigrants who are union
   members. Next, licensure raises pay at the individual and workplace
   levels, although any reduction in immigrant-native pay gaps is
   contingent on immigrants' access to licensed jobs. Our findings support
   the claim that institutional regulation in the workplace reduces the
   organizational scope of unequal pay based on immigrant status.},

Abstract = {The Italian judicial system is well-known for its substandard
   performance by comparison with its European peers. In this article, we
   analyse the implementation of an important reform of the Italian
   judicial system designed and implemented in the context of the National
   Recovery and Resilience Plan funded by Next Generation EU. The reform,
   launched in February 2022, involves the introduction of a new
   organisational structure (The Office for the Trial) staffed with 16,500
   newly appointed judicial assistants, representing an increase of about
   one third of the total judicial workforce employed in Italy. By
   leveraging the concepts of policy and organisational learning (OL), we
   show that variation of the modes of policy learning observed in
   implementation design is linked with variation in the organisational
   models adopted by different judicial offices to implement the reform.
   Then, by connecting organisational models to OL and focusing on the
   performance of five selected sections within the Court of Appeal of
   Milan, we show that organisational models informed by reflexivity are
   associated with better performance than models informed by hierarchy.
   The study contributes to scholarship on policy and OL, as well as
   providing a first, albeit limited and exploratory, empirical evaluation
   of a strategic public sector reform.},

Abstract = {How was the scope of nuclear weapons policy change immediately after the
   Cold War determined? Nuclear learning and worst-case thinking are common
   but not satisfactory answers. On the basis of primary sources in
   multiple languages, we posit that a particular temporalization of
   nuclear events in the beginning of the 1990s took place:
   nonproliferation timescaping. The Iraqi case of opaque proliferation was
   treated as the harbinger of future nuclear danger, while the breakup of
   the nuclear-armed USSR was depicted as not repeatable or not to worry
   about, and South African nuclear disarmament was reframed as a
   non-proliferation success.},

Abstract = {Researchers and practitioners agree that collaborative innovation is
   crucial for problem-solving in public policy. This article contributes
   to our understanding of innovation in public governance, by arguing that
   failure in public policy is often a prerequisite for successful policy
   learning and innovation. Using insights from the `Innovator's Dilemma' -
   a theory from business studies - to develop its argument, the article
   emphasises how voter myopia (Nair and Howlett, 2017) plus blame
   avoidance by decision-makers and ill-structured policy issues, create an
   `Innovator's Dilemma' that produces failure before successful
   innovation. The article compares this theory with other concepts of
   innovation in the public sector and theorises different pathways to
   successful policy innovation. It concludes that decision-makers need to
   take the Innovator's Dilemma more seriously and integrate its lessons
   into existing innovation models designed for the public sector.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the discourses on Indonesian identity as they were
   negotiated by Indonesian intellectuals in the late colonial period,
   1900-1942. During this period, ethnic diversity and Islamism constituted
   key issues in which different intellectuals exchanged their thoughts as
   to what it meant to be an Indonesian. This paper argues that, while
   various ideological discourses for the formation of Indonesian national
   identity had developed in the early twentieth century, the depth that
   these discourses were debated and agreed upon by the Indonesian
   intellectual elite was asymetrical. Strong nationalist discourses had
   promoted a key political instrument by which to unite a people of
   diverse ethnicity, race, and religion. On the other hand, the debates on
   the discourse of Islamic identity during the same period lacked
   consensus among Muslim scholars and between Islamists and secular
   nationalists, especially concerning the concept of unity, nationalism,
   and independence, and the role of women and polygamy. Notwithstanding
   this, Javanese Islamic syncretism and the colonial containment policy
   towards Islam also contributed as external factors which served to
   constrain Islamists from positing an overt Islamic identity.
   Concurrently, it raised the nationalists' racial transcendence as a
   shared value of being Indonesian.},

   diminishes the prospects for conflict in Asia, allowing Russian military
   efforts to be concentrated in the European theater. Additionally, the
   decision to use force will be analyzed in its strategic dimension. It is
   concluded that Russia's activities against Ukraine are entirely
   consistent with Offensive Realism, despite of Mearsheimer's allegations

Abstract = {The result of an effective management of the redistribution of European
   Union funds should be a reduction of disparities between EU regions by
   guaranteeing their comprehensive and harmonious development and
   supporting the economic and social cohesion of member countries. A
   poorly-conducted programming process of financial interventionism, the
   source of which is EU funds, may result in divergence between regions,
   the direct effect of which would be their social and economic
   marginalisation. For this reason, it is important to skillfully manage
   those funds. The main aim of this article is to present the factors
   affecting the decision-making process of the use of EU co-financing, and
   that includes the pandemic as an external variable being a threat to the
   implementation of investments from the EU's structural funds. To explain
   the multivariate associations between explanatory variables and the
   binary outcome variables, logistic regression was employed. Based on the
   tests' results, significant associations were observed between the
   dependent variable and (a) participation in training co-financed by EU
   funds, (b) receiving information regarding additional EU funds as
   pandemic support, and (c) the suspension of planned investments using EU
   funds due to the pandemic situation. A comprehensive distribution of
   respondents according to the response categories in the analysed
   variables within the entire sample (N = 950) was presented.
   Corresponding associations were evident within a sub-sample (N = 303).
   The model showed that all significant independent variables explain the
   use of EU funds, but the model explains just 28.6\% of the decision to
   use the funds. Thus, the following study indicates directions that
   require further research.},

Abstract = {Motivated by the growing phenomenon of Local Investment Promotion
   Agencies (IPA) and their paradiplomatic involvement in international
   negotiations, this paper aims to analyze the role that these agencies
   have been playing in Brazil and the governance model they adopt. Through
   the case of InvestSP, the most mature Brazilian IPA, this study examines
   the topic based on primary documentation and the perspective of various
   government representatives. As main results, a theoretical framework was
   proposed to help map the logic of operation of a subnational IPA, its
   structure, and motivators. Additionally, it was evidenced that
   paradiplomatic actions have advanced independently by local powers,
   without effective coordination from the federal government,
   characterizing a process of (dis) diplomatic governance and

Abstract = {The text examines one of the most important aspects of Russian
   imperialism, namely its multiculturalism. The practice of exiling
   politically uncertain people to the east of the Empire, as well as
   opening the possibilities for some privileged compradors to pursue
   careers, were only a tiny fraction of the strategies used by the Russian
   authorities to involve representatives of various national minorities in
   (co)building the Empire. It allowed the Russian Empire to use those
   people's physical and intellectual potential to expand the state's
   borders, including during warfare. The encounter of the Polish exile
   Bronis \& lstrok;aw Zaleski and the translator of Tatar origins,
   Iskander Batyrshyn, during the military campaign against the Khoqand
   fortress Aq Masjid will serve as an example. By comparing their diaries,
   which both of them kept throughout the entire expedition, we can gain
   insights into the intricate nature of their positions within the
   imperial structure, their reasons for participating in the venture, the
   impact the hostilities had on the local population, and their perception
   of this conflict. These documents also reveal patterns of
   relationship-building between imperial subjects and authorities as well
   as the role of imperial power in stimulating, restricting or regulating
   relations between different nations. These words were written on 18 June
   1853 by Bronis \& lstrok;aw Zaleski-a Polish political exile-in his
   diary, which he kept during the military expedition to the fortress of
   Aq Masjid, called Ak-Mechet in the Russian Empire.ii How did it happen
   that a Polish nobleman found himself in the Russian army in Central Asia
   in the middle of the 19th century? Why did he voluntarily join the
   military mission against the Khanate of Khoqand, despite being oppressed
   for his pro-independence aspirations himself? What were the reasons
   that, even after being released from forced service and returning to his
   homeland, he kept silent about this particular episode of his service in
   Russian uniform on the Orenburg line in his texts published on Central
   Asia?},

Title = {Seabed mining on the Norwegian continental shelf: Possible consequences

Abstract = {In 2020, the Solberg government initiated a process for allowing mining
   operations on the Norwegian continental shelf. About a third of the area
   in question in 2024 overlaps with the continental shelf and the
   Fisheries Protection Zone around Svalbard. While there is broad
   agreement that Norway has sovereignty over Svalbard and thus can decide
   whether to permit commercial mining activities on the seabed in this
   area, there is a dispute as to whether the Svalbard Treaty's provisions
   apply for Norwegian exercise of authority. This article discusses the
   consequences allowing seabed mining in this area may have, both for
   questions concerning the interpretation of the geographical scope of the
   Svalbard Treaty and the potential for conflict between Norway, other
   states and actors. Three possible outcomes are discussed: (1) that
   Norwegian interpretation of the Svalbard Treaty and rights to the
   resources on the continental shelf around Svalbard are further
   challenged; (2) that Russian fisheries in the Fisheries Protection Zone
   resist for fear of negative environmental impact from the mineral
   industry; and (3) that Norway faces pressure and criticism from other
   states, and especially from the EU, because seabed mining is believed to
   have major, yet unknown, environmental consequences.},

Abstract = {How does institutional change occur in complex societal settings? The
   spectrum ranging from stability via evolutionary or gradual change to
   radical change is one of the most important tensions in
   neo-institutionalist scholarship today. We employ the theoretical
   perspectives of historical institutionalism and punctuated equilibrium
   approaches as a backdrop, which take into account the mechanisms of
   stability and change in pronounced fashion. Our chapter examines the
   empirical case of the question of institutional change in light of the
   development of Germany's economic order: the Social Market Economy. We
   highlight that the historical success surrounding its implementation in
   Germany was tied up in agents' efforts to make a market-based economic
   order palatable to the public at large. Moreover, we argue that in its
   prospective development, reform proposals for the Social Market Economy
   must consider the role of democratic acceptance. That implies taking
   account of collectively-held thought patterns and ideational convictions
   in society, thereby acknowledging that discussions concerning
   institutional change ought to be discussed in relation to their
   respective societal environments.},

Abstract = {Why do national governments choose to transfer some of their
   administrative, political, and fiscal powers to regional authorities?
   This article develops and tests a nationally focused strategic account:
   decentralization is a targeted means to bolster a governing party's
   national-level electoral strength by appeasing the voters of threatening
   ethnoterritorial parties in national parliamentary elections.
   Statistical analyses of decentralization across the subnational regions
   of Western European countries confirm that governing parties transfer
   additional competencies to regions in which an ethnoterritorial party
   threat exists, when the government is legislatively vulnerable. In
   contrast, if a government is not dependent on a region for maintaining
   national parliamentary control, the presence of a strong
   ethnoterritorial opponent will not motivate the government to
   decentralize. These findings help to explain patterns of asymmetrical
   decentralization across regions within a country and why governing
   parties decentralize competencies to subnational governments that they
   do not expect to control.},

Abstract = {Norway's Approach For more than 30 years, through successive
   governments, the main principles of Norway's engagement for Israel and
   Palestina have remained firm. Only a two-state solution can bring
   lasting peace. Both realistic and moral arguments dictate that Israelis
   and Palestinians should have their two separate states. The
   normalization process between Israel and selected Arab countries
   contained promising seeds for a solution, but Hamas' brutal terrorist
   attack on 7 October and Israel's ensuing ruthless attack on Gaza halted
   the process. The dynamics after 7 October altered the region
   significantly. The two-state solution must remain the goal of our
   efforts. The Conservative Party - H \& oslash;yre - supports recognition
   of the state of Palestine, but recognition should come at a time when it
   can best contribute to a solution to the conflict, and that time is not
   now.},

Title = {Between Rationality and Identity: An Analysis of Sweden's Path to
   NATO-Membership},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {82},
Number = {2},
Pages = {117-134},
Abstract = {The full-scale war waged by Russia against Ukraine as of February 2022
   has had profound consequences for the European security landscape,
   triggering significant shifts in geopolitical dynamics and influencing
   individual states' foreign and security policy decisions. This article
   provides an in-depth analysis of Sweden's foreign and security policy
   spanning 2014 to 2022. The focus is particularly on understanding the
   factors that have shaped and influenced Sweden's trajectory towards NATO
   membership - and away from military non-alignment. The examination
   encompasses a review of strategic and geopolitical considerations that
   played a role in Sweden's approach to security and alignment with NATO.
   The article also considers internal factors relevant to the path toward
   Sweden's NATO membership, such as decisionmakers (threat) perceptions,
   state structure, the strength and legitimacy of the state apparatus, and
   internal processes related to culture, identity, the Social Democrat's
   dominant role in Swedish politics, and the country's relationship with
   Finland. From this, the article seeks to provide a thorough
   understanding of the complex dynamics at play, shedding light on the
   internal and external factors that have contributed to Sweden's NATO
   membership application in the face of evolving global security
   challenges.},

Abstract = {The impact of extreme weather events on electoral processes is not well
   understood, yet as the climate changes, such events are predicted to
   become more common. This highlights the need for scholars to investigate
   how natural hazards affect election campaigns and electoral
   administration. Drawing on data from the Electoral Contention and
   Violence dataset, this article uses a difference-in-differences approach
   to assess the effect of tropical storms on electoral contention over
   seven elections held in the Philippines between 1992 and 2010. It finds
   that storms that occur in the year leading up to an election increase,
   and that this effect is likely accounted for by both economic grievances
   consequent upon the negative impact of storms on agricultural output and
   grievances generated by storm-induced disruptions to the electoral
   process. These findings suggest that as climate change intensifies, -
   and the violence that contention often entails - could become more
   common in a number of contexts. This has implications for electoral
   administration, and it implies the need for cooperation across electoral
   and meteorological agencies in places where weather extremes are likely
   to occur in the runup to electoral events.},

Title = {Rentiership and intellectual monopoly in contemporary capitalism:
   conceptual challenges and empirical possibilities},
Journal = {SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 4},
Abstract = {In recent years, the concepts of rentiership and intellectual monopoly
   have gained prominence in discussions about the weakening link between
   corporate profitability and capital investment in high income countries.
   However, there have been few if any attempts to construct measures for
   rentiership and intellectual monopoly using firm-level financial data.
   The absence of such work, we argue, is symptomatic of challenges in
   delineating what qualifies as rent-whether it be intangible rent or
   otherwise. In place of static conceptions of rent and intellectual
   monopoly, we develop a framework for analyzing rentierization and
   intellectual monopolization as dynamic and variegated processes that are
   closely related to financialization. We apply the framework to the
   analysis of the transformation of non-financial firms in the USA since
   the mid-twentieth century and show how it helps clarify the linkages
   between firm-level dynamics and trends associated with household
   inequality, corporate stratification and secular stagnation.},

Abstract = {Russia's war against Ukraine constitutes a severe multi-aspect challenge
   for Ukraine's economy. Existing studies stress the positive role the
   2014 decentralisation reform in Ukraine has had in combating war-related
   shocks. The paper contributes to this literature by exploring the
   factors behind the budget robustness (an ability to return to the
   pre-war levels of revenues) of Ukraine's ``hromadas{''} (self-governed
   municipalities). Our analysis shows that budget robustness positively
   correlates with some war-related factors (lesser exposure to fighting
   and occupation), administrative and demographic ones (population size)
   and social ones (higher voter turnout, higher numbers of cooperation
   agreements between hromadas).},

Title = {Pluralising pluralism in the study of populism},
Journal = {POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 4},
Abstract = {Despite the widespread claim that populism and pluralism are
   incompatible, the latter is rarely defined clearly in the existing
   literature. This is significant as such purported incompatibility is
   used to argue that populist politics cannot sit comfortably within
   liberal democracy. I begin this article by examining the theoretical
   foundations of research on populism and pluralism, particularly from
   scholars who adopt the ideational approach. I highlight how this
   conception of pluralism is limited to protecting minority rights through
   liberal-democratic institutions, without considering how such
   institutions are often exclusionary. I then turn to the contributions of
   Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe on populism, pluralism, and hegemony.
   I suggest that while Mouffe sacrifices the counter-hegemonic potential
   of populism in pursuit of pluralism, Laclau sacrifices pluralism for
   counter-hegemony through his insistence that the universal can only be
   articulated through the particular. Moving beyond Laclau's part-as-whole
   formulation, I develop an understanding of pluralism rooted in
   non-belonging, which grounds plurality in shared constitutive lack. This
   allows for the advancement of an indeterminate concept of `the people'
   without the imposition of a universalised particular. Thinking of
   pluralism in these terms provides critical scholars of populism with a
   conceptualisation which does not depend solely on a liberal vocabulary.},

Abstract = {Every year since 1946, the General Debate has taken place at the
   beginning of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly session.
   Representatives from all UN member states deliver an address, discussing
   the issues that they consider most important in global politics,
   revealing their governments' positions, and seeking to persuade other
   states of their perspectives. The annual UN General Debate statements
   provide invaluable information for scholars of international relations -
   comparable globally and over time. However, these texts are stored as
   poor quality images without relevant metadata, preventing researchers
   from applying data science methods. This paper introduces the complete
   UN General Debate Corpus (UNGDC). Building on a previous incomplete
   release of UNGDC, we have extended the corpus to cover the entire
   1946-present period, included additional data on all speakers and
   provided advanced search and data visualization tools on a new website.
   The complete corpus contains over 10,000 speeches from 202 countries,
   including historical countries - making it the most comprehensive,
   unique and accessible collection of global political speeches. We
   discuss the complete UNGDC, provide relevant information for data users
   and present illustrative examples of how the corpus can be employed to
   address key questions in world politics.},

Title = {Alternative archives: Researching politics with chunks of reality},
Journal = {POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 16},
Abstract = {The challenges and opportunities of accessing empirical material present
   a puzzle insofar as they index simultaneously the politics of research
   archives and the positionality of researchers. Today, amid increasing
   authoritarianism, disinformation, and the obstacles created by the
   securitisation and privatisation of data, access to reliable information
   is frequently blocked or complicated by the interests of political
   management, corporate monopoly, and surveillance capitalism, as well as
   by institutional and personal constraints on researchers. At the same
   time, digital archives, social media, blogs, diverse global
   communications, and even the information management tools of
   authoritarian and corporate control, create innumerable alternative
   access points for research. In this article, we describe all of these
   other access points as `alternative archives', and, in doing so, we also
   seek to highlight three overlapping definitions of their alternative
   status in terms of (1) empirical, (2) counter-hegemonic, and (3)
   epistemic meanings. We next provide five state-of-the-art examples of
   overcoming research obstacles due to state-of-the-world developments in
   surveillance capitalism, securitisation, authoritarianism, information
   control, and human insecurity, suggesting that we can learn from
   obstacles to research as well as the alternatives.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This study analyses the supervision policy of Municipal
   Corporations (MCs) in the Indonesian Muslim community regarding its
   alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
   Design/methodology/approach - As a single case study, purposive sampling
   was adopted to select a municipal corporation policy issued by Ciamis
   Regency, West Java, Indonesia. A novel mixed methods approach, combining
   computer analytics and human intelligence, was introduced to perform
   text analytics. Findings - Text mining identified the most frequently
   occurring words - e.g., ` perumda' (municipal corporation), ` daerah'
   (regional), ` pengawas' (supervisor), ` peraturan' (regulation) - from
   the sample but found no single word indicating business alignment with
   SDGs. Further qualitative inductive analysis was conducted, revealing
   the critical role of MCs' supervisory boards in business planning,
   execution, and reporting to align the MC businesses with local SDG
   initiatives. Originality/value - Aligning MC business activities with
   local SDG actions is entirely within the authority of supervisory boards
   which demands transformational leadership. This research pioneered an
   innovative blend of computer-assisted techniques and human reasoning to
   investigate the supervision policies of MCs concerning local SDG
   actions, with evidence from a Muslim community in Indonesia.},

Title = {Triggering policy learning via formal EU evaluation requirements in the
   case of Cohesion Policy},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLICY ANALYSIS},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU), especially in the context of Cohesion Policy
   (CP), has played a crucial role in developing and promoting policy
   evaluation practices across its Member States. Evaluation systems across
   the Member States have been established to assess CP investments.
   Remarkably, the use of evaluation research and its contribution to
   stimulating policy learning has remained a ``black box.{''} To address
   this issue, this article aims to develop a novel framework centered
   around four conditions for evaluation-based policy learning, namely: (1)
   policy relevance, (2) resources and organizational settings, (3) quality
   of evaluation, and (4) evaluation culture. These conditions are
   retrieved from the existing literature on policy evaluation and applied
   to the six-country cases across the EU. The findings suggest how
   loosening the formal EU evaluation requirements could affect policy
   learning in the Member States.

   La Uni \& oacute;n Europea (UE), especialmente en el contexto de la pol
   \& iacute;tica de cohesi \& oacute;n, ha desempe \& ntilde;ado un papel
   crucial en el desarrollo y la promoci \& oacute;n de pr \& aacute;cticas
   de evaluaci \& oacute;n de pol \& iacute;ticas en sus Estados miembros.
   Se han establecido sistemas de evaluaci \& oacute;n en todos los Estados
   miembros para evaluar las inversiones de la pol \& iacute;tica de cohesi
   \& oacute;n. Sorprendentemente, el uso de la investigaci \& oacute;n de
   evaluaci \& oacute;n y su contribuci \& oacute;n a la estimulaci \&
   oacute;n del aprendizaje de pol \& iacute;ticas ha seguido siendo una
   ``caja negra{''}. Para abordar esta cuesti \& oacute;n, este art \&
   iacute;culo tiene como objetivo desarrollar un nuevo marco centrado en
   cuatro condiciones para el aprendizaje de pol \& iacute;ticas basado en
   la evaluaci \& oacute;n, a saber: (1) relevancia de las pol \&
   iacute;ticas, (2) recursos y entornos organizativos, (3) calidad de la
   evaluaci \& oacute;n y (4) cultura de la evaluaci \& oacute;n. Estas
   condiciones se extraen de la literatura existente sobre evaluaci \&
   oacute;n de pol \& iacute;ticas y se aplican a los casos de seis pa \&
   iacute;ses de la UE. Los hallazgos sugieren c \& oacute;mo la
   flexibilizaci \& oacute;n de los requisitos formales de evaluaci \&
   oacute;n de la UE podr \& iacute;a afectar al aprendizaje de pol \&
   iacute;ticas en los Estados miembros.},

Title = {Irregular Migrants and the Demands of Relational Equality},
Journal = {MORAL PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 4},
Abstract = {Should states naturalize long-term irregular migrants residing in their
   territory? Scholars such as Carens and Rubio-Mar \& iacute;n have
   defended their naturalization by drawing on a theory of social
   membership. However, some have argued that the social membership account
   falls short of requiring the granting of citizenship to irregular
   migrants. Others, such as Brock, Ochoa Espejo, and Hosein, have
   attempted to defend a right not to be deported. I argue that relational
   equality can provide a defense for granting irregular migrants
   citizenship rights - their complete naturalization - which avoids the
   limitations of both approaches: it provides a more solid grounding for
   granting citizenship to irregular migrants, and shows why a right to
   stay still leaves irregular migrants in a morally troubling position.
   Irregular migrants are subjected for long periods of time to the laws of
   the state they reside in without having any power or influence over them
   and face significant difficulties in leaving the country, which results
   in objectionable social inequality. I argue that such concerns about
   inequality of status override the right of the demos to determine its
   membership and concerns about irregular migrants' original breaking of
   the law.},

Abstract = {Making misleading statements may benefit a politician, for example,
   during an election campaign. However, there are potentially also
   negative consequences; political misinformation can taint democratic
   debate, voters may be misled into forming false beliefs, and being
   fact-checked may damage a politician's reputation. Previous research has
   found that correcting misleading statements made by established
   politicians reduces topical misperceptions, but hardly affects voter
   feelings and support. Here, we examined the impact of political
   misinformation and fact-checking when politicians are unfamiliar.
   Participants (N = 406) were engaged in a simulated election campaign set
   in an unfamiliar country, featuring statements from fictional
   candidates. Participants indicated their feelings toward the candidates,
   cast a vote, and rated their belief in the fact-checked statements.
   Misleading statements that were not corrected positively affected
   feelings toward and voting for (right-leaning) politicians. Corrective
   fact-checks had large effects, reducing belief in misinformation, and
   fact-checked candidates were viewed much less favorably and attracted
   far fewer votes. This demonstrates that in the absence of strong
   pre-existing attitudes, corrective fact-checks can negatively impact
   misinformation-spreading politicians who are not (yet) well known.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the great power rivalry of the US and China at
   the World Trade Organization (WTO) through the lens of cooptation
   dynamics. First, it argues that the accession of China to the WTO is a
   case of top-down cooptation meant to tame opposition to the US-led
   international order and to restrain China from security competition.
   Second, it explains why this cooptation deal was not durable and led to
   feedback effects that fueled the US' loss of interest in maintaining a
   powerful WTO. Third, it shows how the WTO crisis triggers a current
   bottom-up effort by middle powers to re-stabilize the WTO through the
   mechanism of Joint Statement Initiatives, which attempt to re-commit the
   US to leadership. The article shows that the US' undermining of the WTO
   and the institutional reaction it evokes in other members are part of a
   reactive sequence dynamic driven by failed cooptation bargains.},

Abstract = {Since its inauguration, the coalition dynamics characterizing the Meloni
   government have been interrelated with managing one of the largest
   investment plans in Italian history: the Next Generation EU-funded
   recovery plan. This windfall represents both a historic opportunity for
   economic revitalization and an unprecedented external constraint for
   Italy. By linking two established research agendas, the coalition life
   cycle and the Europeanisation of domestic politics, this study examines
   the extent to which external constraints arising from EU membership may
   have affected coalition governance. Using a longitudinal design spanning
   almost three decades (1996-2023), the study finds that the
   implementation of the recovery plan is associated both with new trends
   and the accentuation of existing ones, including the strengthening of
   the prime minister's role.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the evidence culture in one of the key global
   knowledge institutions-the World Bank. Framing itself as a ``Knowledge
   Ban,{''} the World Bank is a leading organization in data and evidence
   provision around poverty and inequalities, and as such, it shapes the
   broader evidentiary standards and knowledge infrastructures around the
   world. Drawing on a rich qualitative study of 46 semistructured
   interviews with experts working on poverty knowledge as well as document
   analysis of the key reports and strategic documents, this paper explores
   the manner in which the calculative evidence culture of the World Bank
   mediates the production of evidence and expertise within the
   institution. This paper explores the collectively formulated
   interpretative lenses that guide formative questions such as what counts
   as (good) evidence, how it is used in decision-making, and how to deal
   with uncertainty with data and evidence. By doing so, this paper makes
   two contributions to the literature on evidence-based policymaking.
   First, it provides a cultural lens to the production and use of evidence
   in policymaking, a lens that is significantly underdeveloped in the
   existing scholarship. Second, it addresses the question of evolving
   evidentiary standards and learning within knowledge organizations. By
   exploring how institutions ``change their mind,{''} this paper provides
   a dynamic account of the evolving politics of knowledge within
   organizations.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to categorize the forms of autonomy developed by
   Indigenous and peasant movements in Latin America into three types: a)
   de jure autonomies versus de facto autonomies; b) explicit autonomies
   versus implicit autonomies; and c) (mono)ethnic autonomies versus
   popular or class autonomies. We argue that the debate between these
   conceptions takes on a possible strategic importance when it comes to
   the dialogue between Indigenous and peasant struggles regarding the
   defense of territory as well as in the conception of peasant autonomy,
   understood as a strategy of struggle and local self-governance.},

Abstract = {Concerns about online political advertising often focus on the
   techniques used to engage the intended audience. This article assesses
   the communicative strategies used in online political advertising and
   their reception by the public by analysing 2272 Facebook ads during the
   2019 UK general election. By examining the prominence, tone, and source
   of six communicative strategies, we find that different communicative
   strategies are not used to the same extent. While positive tones are
   predominantly used by all actors, negative tones are more prevalent in
   several strategies, especially when mobilised by satellite campaign
   groups. Moreover, ads with negative strategies are deemed less
   acceptable compared to those employing targeting or positive strategies.
   However, when negative and positive strategies are combined, adverts can
   be deemed more acceptable. This study contributes new empirical evidence
   regarding the communicative strategies deployed in online political ads
   and offers insights for campaigners about public perceptions.},

Abstract = {Protection is traditionally conceptualised in relation to the state. Not
   only does the state provide protection externally, i.e. vis-\&
   agrave;-vis other states in an assumed anarchical system, but also
   internally through various instruments of care. Such protection however
   relies on the social contract and is thus inherently transactional.
   Protection, and associated care, then becomes something earned,
   something one is entitled to by virtue of certain, past, actions and
   behaviours, rather than something that is compassionately provided. How
   can we rethink protection away from the state? How to transform glimmers
   of hope of alternatives to the transactional model into sustained and
   sustainable change and care? We want to think through and offer
   alternative ways of care/ing: those more (inter-)personal, more
   community-focused, centred around intergenerational promises and
   responsibilities to ensure both a liveable present and future,
   ultimately disrupting imposed (state) boundaries that rely on and foster
   difference.},

Abstract = {This short piece problematises the politics of the British military's
   protection promises. In it, we explore how the future is
   instrumentalised to govern in the present and how this shapes the
   military's response to sexual violence perpetrated by its personnel.
   First, we consider protection as a negotiated attachment to future
   security. We show how the military's promise to protect women within its
   ranks through the eradication of sexual violence works to substitute
   crises in the present for an investment in tomorrow. Second, we argue
   that through this promise of a future untainted by sexual violence, the
   figure of the female soldier is sustained and re-integrated into a
   future imagination of a progressive military and, in turn, a more
   gender-equal national public. Third, through a discussion of the
   enduring temporalities of sexual violence we reveal the fragile and
   illusory efforts underpinning these promises of protection. In
   recognising the diverse temporal patterns contained within military
   sexual violence discourse, then, we highlight the everyday violence
   inflicted upon servicewomen whilst problematising the tacit formations
   of military power reproduced through promises of protection.},

Abstract = {Political parties are used to adapt in the face of political challenges,
   but little is known about how party elites actually perceive crises and
   ultimately opt for certain types of reforms accordingly. To address this
   gap, we focus on the complete transformation process of the Belgian
   French-Speaking Christian Democratic Party (cdH) in 2022 as a case
   study. Interviews with party elites show how challenges shared by many
   West-European centre-right parties can create a dependence on the party
   leader to the point of marginalizing other traditional actors from the
   definition of a response strategy. We reveal the unprecedented strategy
   employed by the leader, who positioned an advisor as a surrogate, at the
   cost of creating major internal dissension. We argue that the likely
   multiplication of mainstream parties slipping into great distress in the
   near future could lead to a shift in managing party change, making it
   more technocratic than political.},

Abstract = {Self-protection heeds the promise to disrupt the often-gendered
   hierarchies intrinsic to the relations between the protector and the
   protected. At the same time, relational feminists have more recently
   troubled the very notion of `self' as deeply grounded in the body
   politic of the modern State, on the one hand, and the liberal imaginary
   of the sovereign individual, on the other. Drawing on this critique, we
   unpack who the `self' is in self-protection and what kind of `bodies' it
   claims to represent. Moving away from ethical individualism towards the
   feminist ethics of solidarity, we reimagine self-protection in relation
   to the collective body of the social or political community, where all
   subjects are able to act as both protectors and the protected. By
   uprooting the `self' of protection from the liberal framework of
   sovereign state/individual, this intervention opens up the space to
   explore new possibilities for collective action for protection, based on
   a relational co-production of self.},

Abstract = {How concerned are workers about the impact of technological changes on
   employment, and what policies do they prefer to mitigate potential
   negative effects of these changes? We address these questions by
   presenting new analytical distinctions among different types of labour
   market concerns. We differentiate among the risk of job substitution,
   `technostress' and general apprehension about the impact of technology
   in the workplace. In terms of policy responses, we distinguish between
   worker preferences for job loss compensation, retraining and distinct
   measures of `technological protectionism'. Using survey data from Spain
   and innovative measures of these concepts, our findings reveal that
   concern about job substitution is modestly correlated with support for
   some redistribution policies. By contrast, both technostress and general
   concerns about the impact of technology significantly increase support
   for protectionist policies but not redistribution. These results
   contribute to understanding how workers might respond to the labour
   market effects of new technologies such as artificial intelligence.},

Title = {An analysis of ideational foundations of Morocco's integration into
   ECOWAS},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Month = {OCT 4},
Abstract = {This article examines the impact of ideational elements on state efforts
   to achieve regional integration, with a specific focus on Morocco's
   pursuit of membership in the Economic Community of West African States
   (ECOWAS). This study investigates how shared cultural heritage,
   historical narratives, and common views on principles such as free trade
   and security partnerships foster a sense of collective identity among
   states, thereby promoting deeper cooperation and integration within
   regions. However, conflicting ideologies can create obstacles to
   meaningful integration by breeding distrust and friction among
   participating states. This study argues that constructivism provides
   valuable insights into regional integration processes by emphasizing the
   importance of shared norms, identities, and social interactions among
   states. The analysis reveals that Morocco's aspiration to align with the
   interests of other African states in ECOWAS and promote economic
   integration serves as the ideological basis for its pursuit of ECOWAS
   membership, viewing it as a symbol of African resurgence and a means to
   strengthen its regional position. Although Morocco's history, laws,
   society, and politics align with ECOWAS norms, the absence of provisions
   for new members in the ECOWAS Treaty presents a hurdle for Moroccan
   accession. Nevertheless, this article suggests that the ECOWAS Authority
   of the Heads of State and Government could potentially address this
   issue by establishing a supplementary protocol to admit Morocco,
   underscoring the significance of ideological factors in shaping regional
   integration processes and institutions.},

Abstract = {The farmers' protests sweeping across Europe during the early month of
   2024 have highlighted the discontent felt by many residing in rural
   areas. Protests have been motivated by increasing input costs, falling
   prices of agricultural produce and more stringent regulations. In this
   paper, we go beyond the economic rationale for the protests and ask what
   broader sociological factors could be driving rural discontent. To this
   aim, we investigate political `recognition gaps' between rural residents
   and their urban counterparts - that is, the differences in the degree to
   which people feel respected and recognised by their governments. Using
   data collected in the spring of 2022 across the 27 Member States of the
   European Union, we document that a sizeable proportion of the sample
   perceive a lack of fair treatment and respect from their governments.
   Notably, these gaps in perceived respect are significantly larger in
   rural compared to urban areas. The differences in perceived recognition
   between rural and urban areas hold even after controlling for a wide
   range of sociodemographic characteristics, showing that it is not just
   differences in the observable characteristics between rural and urban
   residents that are driving these different levels of perceived
   recognition.},

Abstract = {An important question in public management is whether public
   organizations should prefer or avoid specialist managers (i.e., managers
   whose professional backgrounds match the work they oversee). Research
   has shown that specialist managers are associated with better
   field-specific performance in public organizations, and theory suggests
   that they lead differently than nonspecialist managers. However, there
   is no empirical evidence to support this latter claim. To remedy this,
   we investigate whether specialist managers prioritize core service
   provision more and communicate better than nonspecialist managers.
   Through multilevel regressions of employee reports of leaders' behaviors
   in the contexts of schools, eldercare, daycare, and employment, we find
   that specialist managers prioritize core service provision more in all
   contexts but schools and communicate better in eldercare and employment
   but not elsewhere. These findings are consistent with the theoretical
   expectations and thus emphasize the importance of educational background
   in shaping managerial behavior.},

Abstract = {Local governments are dealing with student information more and more
   frequently, resulting in the risk of student information being leaked,
   so it is necessary to introduce relevant policies, laws and regulations
   to standardize information collection activities and improve the level
   of social information governance. Therefore, this study proposes three
   hypotheses: on the one hand, whether the information policy issued by
   the local government can guide students' information collection
   activities, and on the other hand, whether the introduction of local
   laws and regulations can provide protection for students' information
   security; Finally, whether public participation can provide supervision
   for student information collection and governance, and create a good
   public management environment. The results show that local information
   laws and regulations can regulate the behavior of students' information
   collection and clarify the purpose and direction of students'
   information collection. At the same time, laws and regulations such as
   privacy protection and local codes of conduct can improve the security
   of student information and ensure the legal collection of information.
   The active participation of the public is conducive to the public
   information collection environment and ensures the overall security of
   student information. Therefore, local government policies, laws, and
   regulations can provide assurance and support for students' information
   security and promote the sustainable development of digital education.},

Abstract = {Administrative burdens are an important policy tool that has received
   growing scholarly attention. Burdens are consequential and serve as a
   contributor to incomplete program take-up. However, our knowledge is
   limited on how program characteristics affect public attitudes toward
   burden-increasing or decreasing policies. Based on our knowledge of
   public attitudes toward the welfare state, two such characteristics,
   whether benefits are ``earned{''} and whether they come in the form of
   in-kind services or cash payments, may also affect perceptions of
   administrative burdens. Using a nationally representative survey (N =
   2904), we tested support for two administrative burdens (in-person
   interviews and requirements for government-issued documents) and two
   administrative easings (presumptive eligibility and express lane
   eligibility) for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Temporary
   Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) in the United States. In general,
   we found no strong and consistent differences along both dimensions.
   However, Republicans, Conservatives, and those high in racial resentment
   consistently favored increasing burdens and opposed decreasing burdens
   with the opposite effect for Democrats, Liberals, and those low in
   racial resentment. Americans supported administrative burdens in the
   form of documentation requirements across all programs. However, they
   were open to burden decreases.},

Abstract = {Cyber attacks against the EU and its Member States have increased in
   recent times, which demonstrates the rapid blurring of the boundaries
   between the civilian and military components of cyberspace. Indeed,
   these events clearly highlight the critical interdependence between
   physical and digital infrastructures. While Member States have different
   and divergent perceptions of the prevailing threats, the EU, as
   guarantor of security, has been implementing strategies since the early
   2000s to pursue a joint action aligned with the objective outlined in
   Article 24 of the TEU, namely, a common European defence also in
   cyberspace. This paper will thoroughly analyse the latest European
   initiative on cyber defence policy, adopted in November 2022, to
   highlight new aspects and previous elements trying to answer whether we
   are making any real progress in this area.},

Abstract = {How receptive are societies to the reintegration of deradicalized
   terrorists? Specifically in countries where the terrorists attacked the
   communities targeted for reintegration. I posit that closer proximity to
   terrorist violence is correlated with lower receptivity to reintegration
   in such scenarios. I examine the disposition of Nigerian citizens toward
   the Government's deradicalization and reintegration program. I delineate
   three community categories: Core, Outer, and Peripheral based on their
   proximity to incidents of terrorist violence. Employing semi-structured
   interviews with 100 Nigerians across these communities, the empirical
   findings contradict my initial arguments. Surprisingly, the community
   closest to terrorist violence exhibited the highest receptivity to
   reintegration. Furthermore, community residents' proximity to designated
   reintegration venues was negatively correlated with receptivity towards
   reintegration.},

Abstract = {Using the elite and expert interview approaches, the article situates
   the city mayor of a highly urbanized city in the Philippines as a policy
   entrepreneur championing sustainable development based on Mintrom and
   Norman's (2009) four essential qualities of policy entrepreneurs,
   namely, social acuity, problem-solving, leading by example, and
   team-building as supported by the narratives and discourses culled from
   an elite interview and reinforced by relevant literature, documents,
   independent sources and scholars. More importantly, the article seeks to
   discover the policy-entrepreneurial qualities of the city mayor on
   sustainable development, analyze the sustainable development issues and
   challenges the city mayor encounter, and synthesize how the city mayor
   addresses such issues and challenges as a problem-solver. Finally, the
   article implies the necessity of exploring policy entrepreneurship as a
   potential research thrust in the context of sustainable development
   particularly at the local government which is the level of governance
   closest to the people.},

Title = {A Tale of Terror: Autoethnography and the Study of Terrorism},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 19},
Abstract = {Although terrorism is the only form of violence named after an emotion,
   terror, there appears to be negligible attention paid to comprehending
   and analysing this core emotion. Due in large part to the unique
   subjective factors of terror, there is immense difficulty in quantifying
   the emotion. Similarly, attempts to qualify emotions using qualitative
   methodologies are underexplored. This paper presents autoethnography as
   a legitimate, viable, and ethical research method for the study of
   terror in terrorism. The author advances a first person account of the
   experience of terror from a recognised terrorist attack in Istanbul in
   2016. The intention is to provide a starting point for understanding the
   emotional complexities of terror, its unique qualities, and the inherent
   problems of researching and analysing such an emotion. The paper argues
   for the need to understand the emotion of terror, the unique
   characteristics that make the study difficult, how autoethnography can
   overcome such obstacles, and illustrates the point with a detailed
   accounting of personal experience of a terrorist attack.},

Abstract = {Climate migration will be one of the most important challenges in the
   coming decades, and although many international institutions are
   beginning to recognise this challenge, there is no coordinator for these
   efforts. The EU, because of the resources at its disposal and the fact
   that it is a world leader in the fight against climate change, can play
   this role. It can also be one of the elements of building and
   strengthening the EU's partnerships in the international arena, and it
   could strengthen the flagship political project of recent years, i.e.
   strategic autonomy. The aim of this article is to analyse the EU agenda
   and the actions taken so far to prepare the EU and the international
   community to manage climate migration on a global scale.},

Abstract = {Which governments implement interventionist or liberalising labour
   policy reforms, and does the economic context matter? Drawing on the
   previous literature on government ideology and public policy, we
   hypothesise that leftist governments are more likely to implement
   interventionist labour policies. However, we also expect that economic
   circumstances influence parties' room to manoeuvre, and we thus
   hypothesise that the impact of government partisanship on labour policy
   reform will be weaker during troublesome economic circumstances. The
   main contribution of this paper is empirical, in that we take seriously
   the `dependent variable problem' of policy studies that look to
   aggregate measures to detect instances of retrenchment, by making use of
   a new dataset on the directionality of 1,446 individual labour reform
   measures enacted across 13 nations between 1978 and 2017, allowing us to
   compare government labour policy during periods of varying levels of
   budgetary deficit, employment, and debt levels. Our results show that
   left-wing governments implement more interventionist labour policies,
   but only during less economically `challenging' periods - during dire
   economic circumstances, economic orthodoxy seems to trump ideology in
   governmental policy-making processes.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Scholarly work on populism and borders have largely followed separate
   paths so far. This article aims at bringing together these two strands
   by means of an empirical analysis of individual attitudes on a
   re-bordering policy in the context of a national-populist mobilization
   against the free movement of persons. Recent contributions on border
   regions in affluent countries have highlighted an increased opposition
   to European integration that is fueled by political actors from the
   populist radical right. We hypothesize that border residents are more
   opposed to the free movement of persons than non-border residents the
   more they are exposed to the influx of cross-border workers. The
   empirical analysis draws on a representative post-vote survey from the
   so-called ``VOTO studies{''} on a popular initiative by the radical
   right that demanded Switzerland's termination of the free movement of
   persons with the European Union in 2020. In line with our hypothesis, we
   find a significant positive interaction effect between border residence
   and the share of cross-border commuters on the likelihood to vote in
   favor of this proposition. While border residence turns out to be
   insufficient to foster increased re-bordering attitudes, we show that
   the magnitude of incoming cross-border commuters makes a difference.},

Abstract = {The African National Congress (ANC)'s historic links to the Soviet
   Union, its interpretation of non-alignment as being about resisting
   Western imperialism, and its contention that the abrogation by the West
   of its commitment not to expand further East, shaped the party's initial
   response to the Russia-Ukraine war. Whereas certain factions within the
   ruling ANC interpreted non-alignment in ideological terms, others saw
   non-alignment rather as a strategy to enhance autonomy. For many South
   Africans and some government officials this version of non-alignment
   involved obtaining autonomy through neutrality as a strategy rather than
   an ideology. These differences of interpretation-coinciding with
   Pretoria's role as host of the BRICS Summit where Putin was expected to
   appear-put South Africa between a rock and a hard place, triggering
   domestic opposition. However, this dilemma also enabled proponents of
   non-alignment as a strategy to prevail, culminating in South Africa
   adopting a more balanced position since June 2023.},

Abstract = {The V4's opposition to common internal migration policies has often been
   explained through their lack of affectedness by migration and their
   anti-immigrant publics. Yet, the V4 have taken a key role in external EU
   migration policies and become the third largest donor under the EU
   Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. Through this theory testing case study,
   we argue that international standing and reputation, as well as an
   attempt to remain both responsive to their electorates and responsible
   towards their European partners, were key motivations in adopting this
   role. Our evidence suggests that the V4 supported external and border
   policies to demonstrate cooperativeness and responsibility to those
   European partners who had previously criticised their lack of
   solidarity. They did so in the external dimension, as this area was much
   less salient for their domestic audiences, allowing them to also remain
   responsive to domestic voters as well.},

Abstract = {How can one increase openness towards conflict refugees in states that
   have experienced conflict? While highlighting shared war experience may
   reduce hostility toward refugees by enabling people to better understand
   the plight of refugees, it may also foment higher levels of out-group
   antipathy due to heightened feelings of threat. To answer this question,
   we leverage the context of South Korea, a country that technically
   remains at war with North Korea for more than 70 years and yet attracts
   asylum seekers as an advanced economy. This provides a hard case to
   shift residents' refugee acceptance, as challenges associated with
   accepting refugees are amplified with ongoing threat concerns. Employing
   an original survey, we find that when the parallels between the human
   costs of the Korean War and current conflicts are underscored, refugee
   acceptance increases, particularly among those whose families were
   displaced by the war. Moreover, this strategy is more effective than
   perspective-taking exercises.},

Abstract = {The Clinton administration's drive to enact reform in Ukraine during the
   1990s was viewed at the time as being necessary for the nation's
   revitalization and re-integration into Western Europe. Decades later,
   these policies have been critiqued for antagonizing the Kremlin, causing
   it to seek political control over its former satellite. This paper
   addresses the viability of the Clinton administration's efforts and the
   reasons for their ultimate failure. It finds that despite its best
   intentions, the administration's economic strategy faced unanticipated
   resistance from the Kremlin, as long-standing ties with Kiev undermined
   US-led efforts for economic and political reform.},

Title = {Exploring coherence, learning and directionality in policy mixes for
   sustainability transition: the case of the Norwegian maritime
   transport's decarbonization},
Journal = {GLOBAL PUBLIC POLICY AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 11},
Abstract = {Achieving Sustainability Transition (ST) targets poses challenges for
   public authorities, decision-makers, and policies. It is not enough to
   rely on a single policy instrument. Policy researchers have yet to fully
   explore the reasons and methods for policy mixes and how different
   policies interact. This article looks at two critical questions
   regarding policy mixes: Do they align with each other both vertically
   and horizontally? Furthermore, do they continue to move in a consistent
   direction as they learn? ST policies are generally conceived under a
   comprehensive vision and a societal change perspective. However, studies
   still need to attempt to combine the concepts of learning and
   directionality into a time perspective for evaluating the ST policy mix.
   In this vein, the paper aims to design a conceptual framework for
   bridging this gap and consider policy mix evaluation as a continuous
   nested process rather than a sequential process. To answer the two
   previous questions, we applied this conceptual framework to a case study
   to evaluate the coherence of a specific ST policy mix via learning and
   directionality. Our findings demonstrate that policy coherence can be
   understood not only through static interactions but also through dynamic
   interactions between objectives and instruments.},

Title = {How did refugees and migrants' solidarity initiatives become an

   pandemic in Cape Town, South Africa?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The impact of COVID-19 on refugees and migrants in South Africa has been
   profound and multifaceted. Refugees, that is, people who are vulnerable
   due to displacement, have faced a series of challenges exacerbated by
   the pandemic. These challenges include health risks, limited healthcare
   access, economic hardships, food insecurity, disruptions in education,
   mental health concerns, stigmatization, and xenophobia. The pandemic
   disrupted asylum procedures and hindered the delivery of humanitarian
   assistance. While there were efforts to address these issues, the
   highlighting the need for targeted support and policies to protect and
   assist this vulnerable population during and after the pandemic.
   Refugees and migrant communities are among the most vulnerable groups
   during disasters and humanitarian responses. This vulnerability could be
   exacerbated by their presence in foreign lands, where they are
   legitimately discriminated against due to illegality, unrecognized
   documents/permits, or simply being foreign. Additionally, when new
   arrivals or immigrant groups are perceived as poorly integrated or as
   rivaling locals for limited resources, declining public support might
   occasionally limit the scope for robust humanitarian protection
   measures. To minimize the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
   South African government implemented a financial stimulus package that
   supported complimentary monitoring measures for the citizens. However,
   the government's response to refugees and migrants focused mainly on
   closing the land border, with limited social protection for refugees and
   asylum seekers. Perhaps the most significant benefit of COVID-19 was
   global solidarity to curb its spread and humanitarian assistance in the
   areas of health, finance, and other relief items such as food. One can
   assume that the collective self of the global community exhibited high
   levels of solidarity despite some discrimination being observed in the
   areas of vaccines. Indeed, disaster-stricken communities need
   solidarity, not charity, as observed during the pandemic. This article
   theorizes how the existing structure of solidarity scholarship
   purposefully incorporates both the necessity of tangible responses to
   people's needs and the alternative conceptions of participation and
   self-organization. This study utilized a qualitative approach,
   collecting data from selected migrant and refugee communities in urban
   centers of Cape Town, including participants from Bellville central
   business district (CBD), Parow Centre, Goodwood Centre, and Cape Town
   CBD, who provided humanitarian support during the pandemic. In total,
   seven interviews were carried out, and participants were selected
   depending on their availability using a combination of purposive and
   snowball sampling techniques. Data were analyzed thematically based on
   the research question. The study drew on the pragmatic realities of
   refugees and migrants' solidarity initiatives and explored how they
   contributed to the COVID-19 humanitarian response in Cape Town, South
   Africa. This research aimed to investigate how solidarity initiatives
   led by refugees and migrants have functioned as interventions for
   disaster and humanitarian response in the context of the COVID-19
   pandemic in Cape Town, South Africa. The study findings from
   participants revealed that members of refugee and migrant communities
   relied on a vital solidarity initiative as coping strategy in order to
   deal with the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine
   restrictions.},

Abstract = {The British Labour Party turned itself into a plausible party of
   government with astonishing speed, a mere five years having passed
   between former party leader Jeremy Corbyn's epic defeat by Boris Johnson
   in 2019 to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's landslide victory in 2024. The
   Conservative Party's Brexit obsession and twenty-first-century populism
   damaged Britain immensely by raising barriers with its nearest and
   largest economic partners, and by ripping apart an organic,
   semi-constitutional relationship that also encompassed foreign and
   security policy. In summer 2024, however, the centre seemed to be
   holding in the United Kingdom, as well as in France. Whether such a
   salutary result could be reached in the United States, roiled by an
   assassination attempt on Donald Trump and a Supreme Court decision that
   seemed to largely exonerate him for the 6 January 2021 insurrection and
   facilitate his dictatorial designs, remained to be seen.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 3},
Abstract = {Over the last two decades, LGBTQ+ individuals in Russia have been using
   digital media to communicate and mobilize, making up for their lack of
   representation in mainstream media. However, the government has
   strengthened its control over the internet to reinforce
   authoritarianism, traditionalism, and anti-Westernism, using queerphobia
   to target online sources of `LGBTQ+ propaganda.' This article explores
   the important role of digital media in Russian LGBTQ+ activism and how
   activists deal with issues of community and visibility in the face of
   growing authoritarian control. Russian LGBTQ+ activists face the
   challenges of balancing safety, visibility, and belonging. To make the
   most impact, they use creative strategies and international digital
   media, utilizing delocalized visibility to achieve belonging without
   compromising their safety.},

Abstract = {Corruption remains a significant challenge to the stability,
   development, and well-being of jurisdictions worldwide. To address this
   issue, the United Nations Convention against Corruption, the sole
   legally binding universal anti-corruption instrument, promotes
   cooperation among its signatories to combat this transnational crime.
   Over the past two decades, experience-sharing and capacity-building have
   emerged as effective approaches in international anti-corruption
   efforts, allowing jurisdictions to learn from each other's successes and
   enhance their capabilities. The Independent Commission Against
   Corruption (ICAC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China,
   stands out as a model for fostering international cooperation.
   Leveraging its successful 50-year experience in curbing corruption, the
   ICAC contributes to advancing global anti-corruption collaboration by
   adhering to the principles of ``inclusive dialogue{''}, ``collective
   efforts{''}, and ``shared benefits{''}. In establishing
   capacity-building cooperation with partner agencies, the ICAC adopts the
   principle of ``inclusive dialogue{''}, engaging in in-depth discussions
   to tailor training programs that address specific capacity gaps while
   considering unique cultural, political, and legal characteristics. Under
   the principle of collective efforts, the ICAC actively engages in
   international anti-corruption affairs and currently holds the presidency
   of the International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities. This
   commitment demonstrates their dedication to promoting the effective
   implementation of the Convention and strengthening global
   anti-corruption efforts. By embracing the principle of shared benefits,
   the ICAC has established the Hong Kong International Academy Against
   Corruption, serving as a strategic, institutionalized platform for
   delivering professional training programs to graft fighters from diverse
   regions. These efforts contribute to a more transparent, accountable,
   and corruption-free world.},

Abstract = {In this study, we seek to understand the interplay between industry and
   policy, to explain how and why the UK shifted from the promotion of
   low-emission road transportation, to policy based on zero
   tailpipe-emission electric vehicles (EVs), as part of its evolving net
   zero ambitions. For this, we unify the Multi-Level Perspective, Multiple
   Streams Framework, and Multi-Level Governance into a synthetic model-the
   Multi-Level Governance and Strategy model. Within this, we identify
   distinct windows of opportunity (WoO) that relate to each of the
   technology, policy, and market factors that needed to come together to
   put the UK automotive industry on a specific trajectory. Utilizing
   (pragmatist) grounded theory to analyze our extensive interview and
   documentary data, we find that this trajectory resulted from the
   interplay of technology innovators and policy entrepreneurs in different
   WoO, to achieve the ultimate goal of a functioning market for EVs.},

Abstract = {Drawing upon research across multiple countries, the papers in this
   special issue explore how public authority dynamics affect development
   and humanitarian practices and processes. Some focus on places commonly
   labelled as in crisis or understood to be subject to multiple
   overlapping crises, where responses to epidemics, persistent conflict
   and migrations are in progress. Others examine how public authority
   dynamics affect the everyday governance of development in outwardly more
   stable contexts. The seven empirical papers are complimented by a
   conceptual framework for analysing how power permeates the foundations
   of public authority dynamics. Viewed together, they illuminate why
   exclusions, coercion and violence are often used by those claiming the
   legitimacy to govern, and how grasping what this may mean for
   well-intended interventions or reform efforts remains a challenge for
   practitioners. However, they also point towards a pressing need for
   outsiders to recognise their own roles in constructing and legitimising,
   sometimes harmful, forms of public authority in the places they work.
   And they suggest the first step is to confront a reluctance to
   acknowledge public authority dynamics in their official depictions of
   programmes' progress, learnings and impacts.},

Abstract = {The efficiency of decision-making in public organizations is a key area
   of interest for public administration scholars. Drawing on upper
   echelons theory, this study examines how top managers' empowering
   leadership affects decision-making speed and comprehensiveness in public
   organizations. Through a three-wave questionnaire survey involving 1149
   TMT members from 133 public organizations in China, we tested the
   proposed theoretical model and hypotheses. Our findings reveal that top
   manager empowering leadership positively and indirectly influences
   decision-making speed and comprehensiveness in public organizations, and
   through its effects on TMT behavioral integration. Furthermore, TMT work
   style similarity and TMT cognitive diversity can enhance and weaken the
   mediating relationships, respectively.},

Abstract = {Militant groups delegate operations to contingent, short-term, and
   freelance agents. Informal and ad-hoc employment patterns have
   wide-reaching consequences, yet the literature lacks a systematic
   vocabulary and framework to analyze these practices. Using primary and
   secondary sources, I introduce a descriptive typology of informal
   employment patterns in militant groups. This contributes to scholarship
   and practice by establishing a basis for a systematic comparison of
   variation in militant employment models, particularly highlighting how
   these practices can have far-reaching implications for conflict and
   post-conflict settings. Case studies of informal militant hiring
   practices in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria support the typology.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic generated an unprecedented global crisis with
   long-lasting consequences. In this study, I examine the bi-directional
   nexus between public trust and the management of the pandemic in
   Nigeria. I argue that there is a relationship between government
   management of public policies and the level of public trust. The
   research draws on the Theory of Trust, in-depth interviews (IDI), and
   focus group discussions (FGD) and is supported by other secondary
   sources. I found that the main reason for citizens' resistance to major
   policies introduced to contain the spread of the pandemic was due to an
   entrenched lack of trust in the government, its agencies, and officials.
   The findings also indicate that a lack of transparency and
   accountability in the management of the pandemic deepened the already
   fractured public trust. This was particularly visible in the shrouded
   pattern of disbursing cash transfers, allegations of corruption against
   the managers of the pandemic, and evidence of concealed palliatives
   meant to cushion the negative economic effects of the pandemic. The
   article recommends that the government needs to promote public trust by
   adopting an open governance approach that institutionalises transparency
   and accountability, fosters constant and consistent citizen engagement
   on government policies and programmes, strengthens critical agencies,
   and engenders a sense of belonging for all citizens.},

Abstract = {This paper explores citizens' perceptions of the antimicrobial
   resistance (AMR) problem, addressing the need for governance legitimacy
   in crisis management and policymaking when fighting this crisis.
   Previous research has shown that the public has limited knowledge of AMR
   and has given it little attention. Our study investigates how Norwegian
   citizens perceive the problem of AMR, considering their fear, knowledge,
   and trust, and using panel data from a Norwegian survey. The findings
   show that Norwegian citizens are aware of the severity of AMR and
   express concern about the declining effectiveness of antibiotics.
   However, their concern is linked to their fear of other major crises and
   to their knowledge of AMR, rather than their trust, both generally
   towards others, and in the authorities. This study provides valuable
   insights for policymakers and crisis management strategies. It suggests
   that public policies addressing AMR must consider governance legitimacy
   and the public's awareness, including citizens' fear and knowledge.},

Abstract = {The flexibility/stability tension is a key challenge for
   purpose-oriented networks, especially salient with network
   participation. Because of the voluntary nature of networks, it is common
   for network participation to fluctuate, with participants entering,
   leaving, and returning over time for a variety of reasons. This
   fluctuation may challenge the stability that is key to network
   effectiveness. Yet, despite the salience of this tension, we know little
   about managing the ebb and flow of network participation. Driven by
   phenomenon-based theorizing, we draw on longitudinal participatory
   action research to examine participant attendance and contribution in
   monthly workgroup meetings over a four-year period of an early child
   education network. Combining interviews (n = 5), meeting attendance
   tracking (n = 37), and meeting observations (n = 30), we identify six
   types of flux stemming from individual, organizational, and system
   forces. We find these forces of flux support both flexibility and
   stability. Highlighting the duality of flexibility and stability, we
   explain how flexibility at one level may result in stability at another
   and vice versa. Our findings contribute to a greater understanding of
   how stability and flexibility are both valuable for networks and thus,
   the need to embrace the ebb and flow of participation.},

Abstract = {Deservingness literature has shown that people, including frontline
   workers, spontaneously judge whether welfare recipients are responsible
   for their own situation or are victims of circumstances beyond their own
   control, and that these judgments shape behaviors and opinions. We
   contribute to this literature by examining the impact of clients'
   responsibility for their own sickness on how the clients are treated by
   frontline workers. Using a pre-registered vignette survey experiment
   among 1050 caseworkers, we examine our hypothesis that frontline workers
   treat clients who are responsible for their own sickness more harshly.
   In the experiment, we manipulate whether a client got COVID-19 because
   of his own behavior or was unlucky to catch it. We find that although
   the manipulation strongly influences frontline workers' responsibility
   attribution, it does not affect inclinations to help or sanction the
   client. Our findings highlight that factors other than deservingness are
   important for frontline workers' prioritization of sick citizens.},

Abstract = {The multiple crises of Colombian-Venezuelan borderland geopolitics,
   which include a rise in Venezuelan refugees entering Colombia, mounting
   armed conflict from illegal armed groups throughout Colombia and the
   mixed efficacy of policy responses by the government, are converging to
   drive an evolution in Colombia's security concerns. This convergence of
   crises rivals the security conditions of the early 2000's. As before,
   the government faces prolific armed conflict, loss of legitimacy over
   sovereign territory to a host of illegal armed groups, unchecked coca
   cultivation-trafficking and illicit economies, and an overwhelming loss
   of confidence in the central government's abilities to govern and
   counter these threats. This paper argues that the cumulative effect of
   the nascent convergence of crises is the subsequent rise of mounting
   Colombian insecurity and threats to stability that now permeates
   throughout the country - spanning and linking rural, urban and
   borderland areas in unprecedented ways while driving Venezuelan
   xenophobia and social unrest.},

Abstract = {After the first experiences of the 1980s and 1990s, when politicians
   made use of religion, some evangelical Churches are poised to re-enter
   the political field. It is through the judiciary branch that these
   Churches look to participate in politics, aiming at conquering the
   higher courts, which have become more politicized. But beyond the
   speeches, there are pressure groups, and behind them, class interests
   that take the figure of some great families of the evangelical oligarchy
   and others. It is thus a form of Christian populism that is operating,
   which does manifest itself in its support to a law initiative
   illustrating the conservative moves against ``gender theory{''} rights,
   claiming to build a ``Christian nation{''}.},

Abstract = {Latin America and the Caribbean is becoming the next region of strategic
   importance in an era of great power competition, and no other country is
   more pivotal to the balance of power there than Colombia. Chinese
   influence in Latin America and the Caribbean has increased tremendously
   in the last decade through the expansion of the Belt and Road
   Initiative, trade volumes, and diplomatic pressures on Latin American
   and Caribbean countries, both for them to recognize Beijing's government
   and to remain quiet in international fora about Beijing's human rights
   violations. Field work conducted in Colombia complemented by
   consultation of qualitative and quantitative secondary sources revealed
   that Colombia has been an exception, receiving less Chinese attention
   and investment compared to other countries in the region. Colombia's
   special relationship with the United States, its own reluctance to turn
   towards China, and China's decision to prioritize other nations in the
   region emerge as reasons for why Colombia is an exceptional case. And
   yet, looking ahead, this reality is likely to change. The United States
   must act deliberately and decisively now to strengthen its special
   relationship with Colombia and thus maintain its strategic standing in
   Latin America for the coming decades.},

Abstract = {Debt -based trade and economic exchanges are becoming more and more
   widespread in the context of post -Soviet Central Asian societies. In
   the absence of viable state economic support, a functional banking
   system, and an effective legal system, trust -based economic exchanges
   serve as an alternative means for conducting micro -level businesses in
   Central Asia. The phenomenon of ``rassiychilar,{''} which is the central
   focus of this article, is one of the intriguing examples of debt -based
   trade in rural Fergana, Uzbekistan. This debt -based trade involves a
   myriad of informal economic exchanges among various actors, locally and
   transnationally. The article argues that trust -based economic networks
   and debt -based trade serve as an alternative means of doing business in
   rural postsocialist contexts characterized by legal uncertainty, rampant
   corruption, and an inefficient economic and banking system.},

Abstract = {A burgeoning collaborative government-citizen public service delivery
   mode is hindered by insufficient policy mix credibility for boosting
   citizen participation. One reason is the unclear understanding of
   systematic pathways linking policy mix credibility and citizen
   participation. This article focuses on the relationship between policy
   mix credibility and citizen participation behavior based on the policy
   feedback theory. It also introduces citizen participation willingness as
   a mediator, and ICT tool functionality as moderators to further
   understand their boundary effects. Using a panel data from four
   follow-up surveys during the waste sorting policy pilot in Chongqing,
   China, and employing the difference-in-difference method, we found that
   policy mix credibility influences citizen participation behavior through
   citizen participation willingness. And the translation of willingness
   into actual participation action depends on policy resources represented
   by the ICT tool functionality. The findings solve the theoretical
   perplexity about the role of policy mix credibility in citizen
   participation in public service provision and provide new ideas for
   mobilizing it.},

Abstract = {The cognitive mobilisation thesis suggests that increasing knowledge on
   the European Union (EU) would lead to increased support for the
   institution. We test this with a strategic case whereby we provide
   information on the EU's subsidiarity principle to the citizenry of a
   small member state and examine whether it mitigates negative EU
   attitudes. In an original, pre-registered, population-based survey
   experiment conducted with members of a panel representative of the Dutch
   population, respondents were assigned randomly to a control group or a
   treatment: a professionally produced information video mimicking EU
   communications. Along with estimating the overall treatment effects,
   based on extant literature we assess whether these effects are moderated
   by the respondents' prior EU knowledge and level of populist attitudes.
   Consistent with the information deficit theory, we find that information
   provision decreases negative attitudes among the least knowledgeable. We
   discuss the implications of our findings and provide suggestions for
   further research.},

Abstract = {Contextualist and empirical analyses have recently become important
   tools in political theory due to a growing `methodological turn' in the
   discipline. In this article I argue that realism, the ethnographic
   sensibility in political theory, and comparative political theory should
   be considered as part of this methodological turn. I show that they
   share its diagnosis of a gap between political theory and politics and
   its two principal motivations in closing it. However, I argue that the
   distinct contribution of realism, the ethnographic sensibility, and
   comparative political theory is that they highlight a challenge for the
   methodological turn in that attention to context may widen the distance
   between political theory and politics. I conclude by suggesting that
   this is not an insurmountable obstacle and that it in fact bolsters the
   evaluative function of methodological political theory, keeping it
   distinct from political science.},

Abstract = {The People's Republic of China is central to current debates about power
   shifts in international organisations, but a systematic and
   comprehensive assessment of China-related shifts has been missing. As
   Special Issue introduction, this article contributes to addressing this
   gap and examines whether, how and to what extent China-related power
   shifts have unfolded at the United Nations (UN) over the last two
   decades or so. We define power shifts as changes in the ability of
   actors to shape others' capacities to act and outline a framework that
   builds on Barnett and Duvall's four power types of compulsory,
   institutional, structural and productive power. Drawing from Special
   Issue contributions, our analysis covers empirical insights from the
   UN's three main pillars - peace and security, development and human
   rights - and paints an uneven picture. Despite continuing Western
   dominance, China is mobilising more compulsory power means than two
   decades ago. Chinese attempts to enact institutional power have also
   increased but mostly unfold in multilateral niches and remain cautious.
   While China's structural power position has expanded, China-related
   effects in productive power have so far remained limited and scattered.
   We conclude with a combined assessment of changes across power types and
   discuss research and policy implications.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 11},
Abstract = {Starting in 2015, the terrorist organization known as the ``Islamic
   State{''} (IS) experienced a gradual decline in territorial control
   within Syria and Iraq due to military success on the part of various
   armies and militias, and it was finally defeated as a political entity
   in February 2019. As predicted by terrorism experts and announced by the
   leaders of IS, the gradual fall of the IS led to an increase in
   terrorist attacks in Europe and the US. To combat these threats,
   governments and their security services are relying increasingly on big
   data-based mass surveillance. This paper is concerned with the structure
   and effectiveness of big data surveillance and strategies in countering
   Islamist violence. We develop a Bayesian analysis of the effectiveness
   and performativity of big data-based surveillance and counterterrorism
   methods, where performativity describes the fact that sometimes the very
   measures used to prevent terror can themselves contribute to the
   creation of Islamist violence. Furthermore, we evaluate the ethical
   dimensions of big data surveillance under the assumption of
   performativity.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},

Month = {2024 APR 2},
Abstract = {The article discusses political and media discourses on Russia's all-out
   war in Ukraine. It assesses how convergent or divergent discourses are
   and determines whether the assumption of globalization of information
   flows holds at the time of war. Political and media discourses are
   considered here in conjunction. A method for visualizing and measuring
   the divergence or convergence of political and media discourses is
   developed and applied. In addition to illuminating the concept of war
   propaganda, it can be used to test a range of theories about
   relationships between governments and mass media in a comparative
   perspective. The geographical scope of the study includes five
   countries: Russia, Ukraine, the United States, the United Kingdom, and
   France. The coverage of the first twelve weeks of the war by eleven mass
   media is considered, as well as speeches devoted to the war delivered by
   presidents of the five countries during the same period.},

Abstract = {PurposeGoal orientation shapes employees' approach to and interpretation
   of workplace aspects such as supervisors' behavior. However, research
   has not fully examined the effect of goal orientation as an antecedent
   of abusive supervision. Drawing from victim precipitation theory, this
   study aims to fill this research gap by investigating how employees'
   goal orientation influences their perception of abusive
   supervision.Design/methodology/approachTwo studies were conducted to
   test the hypotheses. In Study 1, 181 employees in 45 departments
   participated in the survey, and multilevel confirmatory factor analysis,
   two-level path model and polynomial regression were used. In Study 2,
   108 working adults recruited from a professional online survey platform
   participated in a two-wave time-lagged survey. Confirmatory factor
   analysis, hierarchical linear regression and polynomial regression were
   used.FindingsThis study found that employees' learning goal orientation
   was negatively related to their perception of abusive supervision. In
   contrast, performance-avoidance goal orientation was positively related
   to their perception of abusive supervision, whereas performance-approach
   goal orientation was unrelated to this perception. Moreover, employees'
   perception of abusive supervision was greater when learning and
   performance-approach goal orientation alignment occurred at lower rather
   than higher levels, and when performance-avoidance and
   performance-approach goal orientation alignment occurred at higher
   rather than lower levels.Originality/valueThis research identified two
   novel victim traits as antecedents of abusive supervision - employees'
   learning goal orientation and performance-avoidance goal orientation.
   Furthermore, adopting a multiple goal perspective, the authors examined
   the combined effects of goal orientation on employees' perception of
   abusive supervision.},

Title = {Complexities of State-Building in Somaliland},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Since the mid-2000s, state-building in Somaliland has emerged as a
   complex mixture of coexisting, competing programs, political
   aspirations, and foreign agendas. This article applies a dialectical
   approach to focus on the scalar relations among actors and models of
   capacity-building, from programs' design to their implementation.
   Drawing on science and technology studies, I use the term
   ``complexities{''} to describe the ``multiplicities{''} of programs,
   actors, and different ways of ordering that coexist and overlap,
   sometimes in tension among them, other times in coordination.
   Specifically, this article examines two approaches to state-building in
   Somaliland: the United Nations Development Program's
   institution-building and US Agency for International Development
   (USAID)-funded stabilization programs. Going beyond fixed binaries, such
   as international and local, homogenous and hybrid, state-building and
   state-formation, this article observes how these dichotomies are formed
   and how, rather than being separate, they combine together, generating
   techno-political arrangements. Somaliland's complexity is made up of
   techno-political arrangements that are coproduced by both technical
   expertise and national political aspirations. Technical
   capacity-building programs, such as the redesign of the Somalia
   Institutional Development Project (SIDP), the creation of Somaliland's
   National Development Plan (NDP), and the allocation of USAID's grants,
   have become the terrain for political claims over the redistribution of
   resources and the control of state institutions.
   Desde mediados de la decada de 2000, la construccion del Estado en
   Somalilandia ha surgido como una compleja mezcla de programas
   coexistentes y contrapuestos, asi como de aspiraciones politicas y de
   agendas extranjeras. Este articulo aplica un enfoque dialectico para
   centrarse en las relaciones a escala entre agentes y modelos de creacion
   de capacidades, abarcando desde el diseno de los programas hasta su
   implementacion. Partiendo de los estudios en materia de ciencia y
   tecnologia, utilizamos el termino << complejidades >> para describir las
   << multiplicidades >> de programas, agentes y diferentes formas de
   ordenamiento que coexisten y se superponen, a veces en tension entre
   ellos y otras veces en coordinacion. En concreto, este articulo examina
   dos enfoques para la construccion del Estado en Somalilandia: Los
   programas de fortalecimiento institucional del PNUD y los programas de
   estabilizacion financiados por la USAID (Siglas en ingles de la Agencia
   de los Estados Unidos para el Desarrollo Internacional). En este
   articulo vamos mas alla de los binarios fijos, como lo internacional y
   lo local, lo homogeneo y lo hibrido, la construccion y la formacion del
   Estado, con el fin de poder observar como se forman estas dicotomias y
   como, en lugar de estar separadas, se combinan, generando arreglos
   tecnopoliticos. La complejidad de Somalilandia se compone de acuerdos
   tecnopoliticos coproducidos tanto por expertos tecnicos como por
   aspiraciones politicas nacionales. Los programas de creacion de
   capacidad tecnica, como el rediseno del Programa de Desarrollo
   Institucional de Somalia (SIDP, por sus siglas en ingles), la creacion
   del Plan Nacional de Desarrollo (PND) de Somalilandia y la asignacion de
   las subvenciones de la USAID, se han convertido en el terreno para las
   reivindicaciones politicas sobre la redistribucion de los recursos y el
   control de las instituciones estatales.
   Depuis 2005, la creation d'un etat au Somaliland est apparue comme un
   melange complexe de programmes concurrents et coexistants, d'aspirations
   politiques et de projets etrangers. Cet article applique une approche
   dialectique pour se concentrer sur les relations scalaires entre les
   acteurs et les modeles de creation de capacites, de la conception des
   programmes a leur mise en oe uvre. En m'appuyant sur la science et les
   etudes technologiques, j'emploie le terme de << complexites >> pour
   decrire la << multiplicite >> des programmes, des acteurs et des
   differentes facons d'organiser qui coexistent et se chevauchent, en
   creant parfois des tensions, d'autres fois en se coordonnant. Plus
   precisement, cet article examine deux approches de la creation d'un etat
   au Somaliland : la creation d'institutions du PNUD et les programmes de
   stabilisation finances par l'USAID. Pour depasser les relations binaires
   fixes (international/local, homogene/hybride, creation/formation d'un
   etat), cet article observe comment ces dichotomies se forment et comment
   elles se combinent, au lieu de rester distinctes, afin de generer des
   arrangements technopolitiques. La complexite du Somaliland resulte
   d'arrangements technopolitiques coproduits par l'expertise technique et
   les aspirations politiques nationales. Les programmes de creation de
   capacites techniques, comme la nouvelle conception du projet de
   developpement institutionnel de la Somalie (PDIS), la creation du plan
   de developpement national (PDN) du Somaliland et l'attribution de
   subventions de l'USAID, sont devenus le terrain de reclamations
   politiques quant a la redistribution des ressources et le controle des
   institutions etatiques.},

Title = {Effects of Self-Legitimation and Delegitimation on Public Attitudes
   toward International Organizations: A Worldwide Survey Experiment},

Abstract = {Public views on international organizations (IOs) have become a matter
   of central concern. While actors in world politics increasingly try to
   legitimize or delegitimize IOs, scholars have begun investigating such
   phenomena systematically. This paper provides the most comprehensive IO
   (de)legitimation study to date. Building on cueing theory, and
   considering input as well as output legitimacy, I examine the isolated
   and combined effects of delegitimation and self-legitimation on public
   perceptions of IOs. I concentrate on government criticism and citizen
   protests as two salient practices of delegitimation. In investigating
   self-legitimation, I focus on IOs' public statements and institutional
   reforms. I study public opinion on the UN, World Bank, and WHO, as IOs
   of different functional scopes and levels of salience. In 2021, I
   conducted survey experiments on more than 32,000 citizens in ten
   countries worldwide (Australia, Canada, Colombia, Egypt, France,
   Hungary, Indonesia, Kenya, South Korea, and Turkey) - weighted by age,
   gender, region, and education. My main findings are: Delegitimation by
   governments and citizen protests has some limited effectiveness,
   depending on the IO in question. While IO self-legitimization statements
   and reforms in themselves do not boost public support for IOs, they are
   generally effective at neutralizing delegitimation attempts by
   governments and citizen protests.
   Las opiniones publicas acerca de las organizaciones internacionales
   (OOII) se han convertido en un tema fundamental de preocupacion.
   Mientras que los agentes dentro de la politica mundial tratan, cada vez
   mas, de legitimar o deslegitimar a las OOII, los academicos han
   comenzado a investigar tales fenomenos de manera sistematica. Este
   articulo proporciona el estudio en materia de (des)legitimacion de las
   OOII mas completo que se ha llevado a cabo hasta la fecha. Partimos de
   la base de la teoria de senales, y consideramos tanto la legitimidad de
   los procedimientos como la legitimidad de los resultados para examinar
   los efectos aislados y combinados de la deslegitimacion y de la
   autolegitimacion sobre las percepciones publicas de las OOII. Nos
   centramos en las criticas por parte del Gobierno y en las protestas
   ciudadanas ya que ambas son dos practicas destacadas de deslegitimacion.
   Con respecto a la investigacion que llevamos a cabo en materia de
   autolegitimacion, nos centramos en las declaraciones publicas y en las
   reformas institucionales de las OOII. Estudiamos la opinion publica
   sobre la ONU, el Banco Mundial y la OMS, al ser estas, OOII de
   diferentes ambitos funcionales y con diferentes niveles de prominencia.
   Durante 2021, realizamos experimentos de encuestas con mas de 32.000
   ciudadanos en diez paises de todo el mundo (Australia, Canada, Colombia,
   Corea del Sur, Egipto, Francia, Hungria, Indonesia, Kenia y Turquia),
   ponderados por edad, genero, region y educacion. Las conclusiones
   principales a las que llegamos son: la deslegitimacion por parte de los
   Gobiernos y las protestas ciudadanas tienen una efectividad limitada,
   dependiendo de la OI en cuestion. Mientras que las declaraciones de
   autolegitimacion por parte de las OOII y las reformas en si mismas no
   aumentan el apoyo publico a las OOII, estas generalmente son eficaces
   para neutralizar los intentos de deslegitimacion por parte de los
   Gobiernos y las protestas ciudadanas.
   L'opinion publique sur les organisations internationales (OI) constitue
   aujourd'hui une preoccupation importante. Alors que les acteurs de la
   politique mondiale essaient de plus en plus de legitimer ou de
   discrediter les OI, les chercheurs ont deja commence l'analyse
   systematique de ces phenomenes. Cet article presente l'etude la plus
   exhaustive de la legitimation et de la discreditation des OI a ce jour.
   En m'appuyant sur la theorie des indices, et en prenant en compte la
   legitimite a l'entree et a la sortie, j'analyse les effets isoles et
   combines de la discreditation et de l'autolegitimation sur l'opinion
   publique quant aux OI. Je me concentre sur la critique du gouvernement
   et les manifestations de citoyens, deux pratiques essentielles de
   discreditation. Pour analyser l'autolegitimation, je m'interesse aux
   declarations publiques et aux reformes institutionnelles des OI.
   J'examine l'opinion publique concernant l'ONU, la Banque mondiale et
   l'OMS-des OI aux fonctions et niveaux d'importance differents. En 2021,
   j'ai mene des sondages experimentaux aupres de plus de 32 000 citoyens
   dans dix pays du monde (Australie, Canada, Colombie, Coree du Sud,
   egypte, France, Hongrie, Indonesie, Kenya et Turquie), que j'ai
   ponderees par age, genre, region et education. Mes conclusions indiquent
   d'abord que la discreditation des gouvernements et les manifestations de
   citoyens ont des effets limites, selon l'OI concernee. Bien que les
   declarations d'autolegitimation et les reformes n'accroissent pas, a
   elles seules, le soutien aux OI, elles permettent generalement de
   neutraliser les tentatives de discreditation par les gouvernements et
   manifestations de citoyens.},

Title = {Positioning among International Organizations: Shifting Centers of

Abstract = {In this paper, regime complexes are conceptualized as dynamic networks
   constituted by relations between international organizations (IOs). We
   introduce ``IO positioning{''} as a conceptual lens for studying
   patterns and shifts in IO networks resulting from negotiations between
   IOs over their distinctiveness and social membership in complex
   organizational fields. We suggest that IO positioning has two
   constitutive effects. First, on the level of individual IOs, positioning
   affects IO identities within the field as these are (re)negotiated in
   relations with other organizations. Secondly, the positioning practices
   of IOs have constitutive effects on the contours of entire policy fields
   too; they form and shift the boundaries of regime complexes.
   Empirically, the paper examines the utility of our approach by analyzing
   the history, dynamics, and positioning effects of interorganizational
   relations between eight IOs in global health governance-an area of
   international cooperation that is commonly portrayed as exceptionally
   fragmented, complex, and densely populated. Examining relations between
   our eight IOs, we provide network analytical longitudinal data of in-
   and out-reporting by IOs derived from IOs' annual reports between 1970
   and 2017. We triangulate our network analysis with data derived from
   semi-structured interviews with health IO professionals.
   En este art \& iacute;culo, conceptualizamos los complejos de reg \&
   iacute;menes como redes din \& aacute;micas constituidas por relaciones
   entre OOII. Presentamos el ``posicionamiento de las OOII{''} como una
   lente conceptual que sirve para estudiar los patrones y cambios en las
   redes de OOII que se derivan de las negociaciones entre las OOII sobre
   su car \& aacute;cter distintivo y su membres \& iacute;a social en
   campos organizativos complejos. Sugerimos que el posicionamiento de las
   OOII tiene dos efectos constitutivos. En primer lugar, a nivel de las
   OOII individuales, el posicionamiento de las OOII afecta a las
   identidades de las OOII dentro de su \& aacute;mbito, ya que estas
   identidades se (re)negocian en las relaciones con otras organizaciones.
   En segundo lugar, las pr \& aacute;cticas de posicionamiento de las OOII
   tambi \& eacute;n tienen efectos constitutivos sobre los contornos de
   campos pol \& iacute;ticos enteros: forman y desplazan los l \&
   iacute;mites de los complejos de reg \& iacute;menes. Desde el punto de
   vista emp \& iacute;rico, este art \& iacute;culo examina la utilidad de
   nuestro enfoque mediante el an \& aacute;lisis de la historia, la din \&
   aacute;mica y los efectos en materia de posicionamiento de las
   relaciones interorganizacionales entre ocho OOII en el campo de la
   gobernanza de la salud mundial, la cual es un \& aacute;rea de cooperaci
   \& oacute;n internacional que , habitualmente, se describe como
   excepcionalmente fragmentada, compleja y densamente poblada.
   Proporcionamos, mediante el estudio de las relaciones entre ocho OOII en
   el campo de la gobernanza de la salud mundial, datos longitudinales anal
   \& iacute;ticos de redes relativos a las evaluaciones peri \&
   oacute;dicas llevadas a cabo por las OOII, tanto a nivel interno como
   externo, derivados de los informes anuales de las OOII entre 1970 y
   2017. Triangulamos nuestro an \& aacute;lisis de redes con datos
   derivados de entrevistas semiestructuradas llevadas a cabo con
   profesionales de OOII del campo de la salud.
   Dans cet article, les complexes de r \& eacute;gimes sont conceptualis
   \& eacute;s tels des r \& eacute;seaux dynamiques constitu \& eacute;s
   de relations entre OI. Nous pr \& eacute;sentons le << positionnement
   des OI >> comme un angle conceptuel pour \& eacute;tudier les sch \&

   eacute;coulant des n \& eacute;gociations entre OI quant \& agrave; leur
   caract \& egrave;re distinctif et leur appartenance sociale dans des
   domaines organisationnels complexes. Nous sugg \& eacute;rons que le
   positionnement des OI provoque deux effets constitutifs. D'abord, au
   niveau de chaque OI, le positionnement a une incidence sur son identit
   \& eacute; dans le domaine, car elle est (re)n \& eacute;goci \&
   eacute;e par rapport \& agrave; d'autres organisations. Ensuite, les
   pratiques de positionnement des OI s'accompagnent aussi d'effets
   constitutifs sur les contours de domaines politiques dans leur ensemble
   : elles forment et d \& eacute;placent les fronti \& egrave;res entre
   complexes de r \& eacute;gimes. Sur le plan empirique, l'article examine
   l'utilit \& eacute; de notre approche en analysant l'histoire, la
   dynamique et les effets du positionnement des relations
   interorganisationnelles entre huit OI du domaine de la gouvernance
   sanitaire mondiale. C'est un domaine de coop \& eacute;ration
   internationale dont on souligne souvent la fragmentation particuli \&
   egrave;rement accrue, la complexit \& eacute; et la densit \& eacute;

   gouvernance de la sant \& eacute; mondiale, nous fournissons des donn \&

Title = {Using Bourdieu's Habitus in International Relations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {The concept of habitus is a centerpiece of Pierre Bourdieu's cultural
   sociology and is among the most popular conceptual imports into the
   Bourdieu-inspired ``practice turn{''} in International Relations (IR).
   There have, however, been recurrent questions whether IR work using
   habitus and Bourdieu mainly ``re-describe in different language{''} what
   scholars already know about world politics. This article argues that a
   more traditional use of habitus that pays attention to the production of
   habitus is key to advancing distinctly Bourdieusian and practice-based
   accounts of international politics. Drawing on a detailed survey of
   habitus scholarship in IR, the article shows how the practice turn takes
   a narrow view of social structure by bracketing social class, race, and
   gender; is preoccupied with the pedagogical labor of secondary
   socialization over primary socialization; and neglects the concrete
   embodied dimension of practice. Looking to Bourdieu's own work, this
   article calls for theoretically armed empirical attention to social
   structure, primary socialization, and embodiment. It articulates a
   specific strategy for this recovery: closer attention to the production
   of habitus by mapping the biographies of individuals and groups and
   relating these sedimented histories to agents' practices and shared
   structures of experience.
   El concepto de habitus es una pieza central de la sociologia cultural de
   Pierre Bourdieu y se encuentra entre las importaciones conceptuales mas
   populares dentro del << giro hacia la practica >> inspirado por Bourdieu
   en el campo de las Relaciones Internacionales (RRII). Sin embargo,
   existen preguntas recurrentes acerca de si el trabajo de las RRII que
   utilizan el concepto de habitus y Bourdieu, principalmente, <<
   redescriben en un lenguaje diferente >> lo que los estudiosos ya saben
   sobre la politica mundial. Este articulo argumenta que un uso mas
   tradicional del habitus que preste atencion a la produccion del habitus
   seria clave para poder avanzar en explicaciones de la politica
   internacional que sean claramente bourdieusianas y basadas en la
   practica. Partiendo de un estudio detallado del conocimiento academico
   existente en materia del habitus dentro de las RRII, este articulo
   muestra como el giro hacia la practica adopta una vision estrecha de la
   estructura social ya que: categoriza la clase social, la raza y el
   genero sin llegar a profundizar en ellos, se preocupa por la labor
   pedagogica que ejerce la socializacion secundaria sobre la socializacion
   primaria, y descuida la dimension concreta y representada de la
   practica. Teniendo en cuenta el propio trabajo de Bourdieu, este
   articulo hace un llamamiento a prestar atencion empirica, pero armada de
   manera teorica, a la estructura social, la socializacion primaria y la
   corporeidad. Este articulo desarrolla una estrategia especifica para
   llevar a cabo esta recuperacion: prestar una mayor atencion a la
   produccion de habitus mediante el mapeo de las biografias de individuos
   y grupos y mediante la relacion de estas historias de caracter
   sedimentado con las practicas de los agentes y las estructuras de
   experiencia compartidas.
   Le concept d'habitus occupe une position centrale dans la sociologie
   culturelle de Pierre Bourdieu et compte parmi les apports conceptuels
   les plus populaires dans << l'evolution des pratiques >> inspiree par
   Bourdieu en relations internationales (RI). Neanmoins, des questions
   reviennent souvent quant a savoir si les travaux de RI qui emploient
   l'habitus et Bourdieu ne se contentent pas de << re-decrire differemment
   >> ce que les chercheurs savent deja sur la politique mondiale. Cet
   article affirme qu'une utilisation plus traditionnelle de l'habitus qui
   s'interesse a sa production est essentielle pour l'avancement des recits
   purement bourdieusiens et fondes sur la pratique de la politique
   internationale. En se basant sur une etude detaillee de la recherche sur
   l'habitus en RI, l'article montre que l'evolution des pratiques adopte
   un point de vue etroit de la structure sociale en mettant entre
   parentheses la classe sociale, la race et le genre, qu'elle se preoccupe
   plus du travail pedagogique de la socialisation secondaire que de la
   socialisation primaire et qu'elle neglige la dimension incarnee
   concretement de la pratique. En s'interessant au travail de Bourdieu
   lui-meme, cet article appelle a une attention empirique a la structure
   sociale, la socialisation primaire et l'incarnation qui s'arme du
   theorique. Il articule une strategie specifique pour cette recuperation
   : une plus grande attention a la production de l'habitus en representant
   les biographies des personnes et groupes, et la mise en relation de ces
   histoires ancrees avec les pratiques des agents et les structures
   d'experiences qu'ils partagent.},

Abstract = {As the COVID-19 pandemic became an unprecedented global threat, it was
   accompanied by an increase in trust in governments as well as fear among
   the public. Previous research suggests that both institutional trust and
   fear contribute to the willingness of citizens to comply with
   anti-pandemic measures. Moreover, fear during the contagion also
   increases trust in government. This article presents a test of the
   mediation of the effects of fear on compliance through trust. In
   addition, it differentiates between three different facets of
   COVID-19-related fear: fear of the disease, fear of economic
   consequences, and fear of political consequences. The results suggest
   that while fear of the disease increases compliance, fear of political
   consequences decreases compliance. Moreover, the effects of fear are
   mediated through trust in government. The negative impact of fear of
   political consequences on compliance increased between April and
   December 2020.},

Abstract = {Are International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs raising greenhouse gas
   emissions in the Global South? I argue powerful actors structure markets
   in ways exacerbating climate change. This works through the IMF's
   imposition of market coercion-specifically, currency devaluation, global
   openness and fiscal pressures from austerity. Countries respond to these
   conditions through extractivist strategies and productive growth to
   increase exports. To investigate this relationship, I use instrumental
   variables and difference-in-difference analyses for 130 countries
   between 1980 and 2018. Results show emissions increase from structural
   lending conditions but not when conditions afford borrowers more
   flexibility. This effect takes several years to manifest. While there is
   no single sector responsible for this change, agriculture, land-use
   changes and, to some extent, industry, have notable emission effects
   following an IMF program. Global South emissions are partly rooted in
   imposed austerity which raises important political questions about the
   climate crisis, development and international finance.},

Title = {Indicator accountability or policy shrinking? Multistakeholder

Abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with their 169 targets and 231
   indicators epitomise the trend of global governance by numbers. This
   article suggests the notion of a global ``indicator reporting
   trajectory{''} that is shaped by three main elements: the politics of
   indicators, a reporting infrastructure and indicator advocacy. I propose
   that indicator reporting trajectories may result either in policy
   shrinking or in indicator accountability. The idea of an indicatory
   reporting trajectory is empirically illustrated with the case of
   indicators on multistakeholder partnerships of SDG 17. High expectations
   are put on such partnerships to accelerate SDG realization, but they
   face several accountability challenges. The analysis shows how
   indicators that capture globally agreed (but contested) goals can
   silently disappear due to a lack of data and measurability during long
   follow-up processes. I argue that there is a great risk for policy
   shrinking with regard to multistakeholder partnerships under SDG 17 and
   that this has implications for accountability and, in the end, for the
   realization of the 2030 Agenda.},

Abstract = {In the past decades, European Union (EU) agencies have proliferated to
   address a plethora of governance problems. When designing EU agencies,
   EU legislators confront a tension: Legislators want agencies to be
   competent problem-solvers, but they also want to keep agencies under
   control. How do EU legislators balance these two imperatives? We argue
   that agencies' political principals do not necessarily have to trade
   competence for control, and vice versa, but can draw on different
   institutional strategies - manipulating agencies' decision-making and
   decision-maker independence - to mitigate the competence-control
   dilemma. Drawing on an original dataset on EU agencies' formal
   independence, we demonstrate empirically that principals customize EU
   agencies' independence to match the respective competence and control
   demands that come with specific agency tasks: regulation, authorization,
   implementation and information. The paper makes an important
   contribution to the literature on the drivers of the EU's agencification
   and to debates on the institutional design of regulatory institutions in
   the EU and beyond.},

Title = {A Psychoanalytic Approach to Turkish Foreign Policy: Crisis, Disorder,
   and Disorientation},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON SECURITY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 4},
Abstract = {What explains Turkey's current foreign policy disorientation, causing
   the country to swing from one position to another in a relatively short
   period of time? We argue that rational arguments do not provide
   comprehensive explanations of the fluctuations in Turkish foreign
   policy. By utilising a psychoanalytic approach, this study argues that
   the relentless radical developments that unfolded at home and abroad in
   the past decade paralysed the Turkish leadership, disrupting their sense
   of order in international politics while detaching them from important
   geopolitical realities. Under this neurotic condition, Turkey's
   leadership has engaged in a constant seek for recognition as a key
   regional player irrespective of how controversial these efforts may be.
   In making sense of this case, this study builds on the ontological
   security literature in International Relations and contributes to the
   existing debates on foreign policy crises by integrating a Lacanian
   notion of jouissance to the ontological security framework. It shows
   that the jouissance approach offers a productive lens which captures how
   an ontologically insecure state like Turkey follows disorderly conducts
   in international politics and gains satisfaction from it as a way to
   reassure its ruptured sense of actorness at times of multiple crises.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {33},
Number = {5},
Pages = {843-867},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {This study investigates court rulings in public environmental pollution
   litigation, analyzing the factors influencing those decisions. We test
   an environmental judicial outcome model that considers the offense's
   seriousness and the defendants' resources/capabilities. Using
   environmental case data from six major cities in Taiwan between 2000 and
   2018, we find that 78.2\% of defendants were found guilty, 52.9\%
   received probation, 19.0\% were fined, and 28.1\% faced imprisonment.
   This pattern differs from Western countries where fines are more
   prevalent and incarcerations rare. Statistical analyses reveal that the
   number of environmental offenses the defendant commits influences the
   court verdict and sentencing decision, defendants from private firms
   have lower odds of being found guilty but a higher probability of being
   fined, and the type of legal representation plays a mixed role in court
   judgments. Over time, there has been an increase in guilty verdicts and
   stricter punishments for environmental offenders in Taiwan.},

Abstract = {Do local political party members reflect the views of voters in their
   constituencies? Since candidate selection by local party members is the
   most common form of candidate selection in the United Kingdom, it is
   important to understand local party members' views, and how those views
   relate to views in the local area. We investigate the degree to which
   individual members' views match local opinion by combining the results
   of a large-scale survey of party members in the United Kingdom with
   estimates of local opinion created using multilevel regression and
   post-stratification. We find that individual party members' views are
   moderately to strongly associated with local opinion on both left-right
   and liberty-authority dimensions. Even so, party members are not
   entirely congruent with opinion in the local area, having opinions which
   are either to the left or right of voters in their local area, and which
   are uniformly more liberal than party supporters.},

Abstract = {In the midst of ongoing crises, understanding how citizens perceive
   administrative crisis management is more relevant than ever. Combining
   organizational literature with insights from legitimacy research, this
   article scrutinizes how the public evaluates governance decisions
   concerning prominent crisis management dilemmas: flexibility versus
   stability, inclusion versus exclusion, and equity-based versus
   needs-based resource distribution. The paper argues that flexible,
   inclusive, and equity-based governance decisions are generally perceived
   as more legitimate. However, governance decisions are also associated
   with adverse effects that can mitigate any initially positive effect on
   legitimacy. The argument is tested in a large-scale randomized survey
   experiment in the context of a migration crisis, where governance
   decisions were manipulated. The findings support the expectations for
   inclusive crisis management and equity-based resource distribution,
   which are perceived as the most legitimate governance alternatives.
   Internal adaptations of administrative practices toward more flexible
   and adaptive solutions, however, are perceived less legitimate than
   stable governmental action.},

   (post)exceptionalist common agricultural policy and the case of the

Abstract = {External shocks and policy spillovers have facilitated a gradual shift
   away from the exceptionalism (exclusive role of agricultural interests)
   in the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). This article argues that
   post-Lisbon decision-making rules and procedures, against some of the
   expectations, slowed this process. First, the parallel veto-based
   negotiations on the bloc's finances gave status quo actors the
   opportunity to influence the CAP indirectly (by blocking the
   redistribution of CAP funds) and directly (through package deals).
   Second, the co-decision procedure allowed the ministers of agriculture
   and the European Parliament's Committee of agriculture to change the
   proposals of the more reform-minded Commission more easily. The argument
   is supported by the case of the CAP 2023-2027 reform, which resulted in
   limited changes given the Brexit-related cut in CAP funding (external
   shock) and the inclusion of environmental targets as part of the
   European Green Deal (policy spillover effects).},

Abstract = {Since the 2010s, Chinese investment in Latin America has increased. It
   is a symbol of the emerging influence of China and represents the
   potential export of its nondemocratic socialist development model.
   Experts have been concerned that China may undermine democracy in
   foreign countries in general and erode the United States' influence in
   Latin America. A discourse analysis of official Chinese documents on its
   foreign policy objectives examines whether Chinese investment has
   undermined the national sovereignty of host nations in Latin America and
   concludes by refuting the myth that China's economic and rise in Latin
   America leads to the adoption of more autocratic governance models.Desde
   la decada de 2010 ha aumentado la inversion china en America Latina.
   Esto constituye un simbolo de la influencia emergente de China y
   representa la exportacion potencial de su modelo de desarrollo
   socialista no democratico. A los expertos les preocupa que China pueda
   socavar la democracia en la generalidad de los paises extranjeros y
   erosionar la influencia de Estados Unidos en America Latina. Un analisis
   del discurso de los documentos oficiales chinos sobre los objetivos del
   pais en politica exterior examina si la inversion china ha socavado la
   soberania nacional de las naciones anfitrionas latinoamericanas y
   concluye refutando el mito de que el ascenso economico de China en
   America Latina haya conducido a la adopcion de modelos de gobernanza mas
   autocraticos.},

Abstract = {The United States should enlarge its concept for countering Chinese
   expansionism to stress economic power in addition to military power. One
   bold move to this end would be to include Vietnam in a redefined `Quint'
   alongside the current Quad comprising Australia, India, Japan and the
   United States. Instead of forging a US-Vietnam defence treaty and
   encouraging a Vietnamese military build-up, which could trigger a
   hostile Chinese reaction, the US would help Vietnam advance its own
   priorities of renewable development and improved worker productivity.
   For this, an American-led business-government initiative will be needed.
   As China's economy sputters while its military investments grow, a Quint
   with both economic and military power could enjoy an advantage in
   peacetime and during crises.},

Title = {Converting for terrorist purposes: challenging the conceptual

Abstract = {Terrorism is typically included among the grave societal challenges
   resulting from radicalisation of certain groups. The phrase `radical
   converts' typically evokes an image of a convert to Islam, whereas an
   individual converting from Islam to other religions is not associated
   with a terrorist threat. When it comes to threat assessment, the
   conversion of Christianity to Islam is typically deemed a potential
   warning sign. On the contrary, the Islam-to-Christianity path is
   typically dismissed as a marker of extremist attitudes. This paper
   challenges the unidirectionality of this assumption and provides a
   reconceptualised framework for assessing the potential terrorist threat
   posed by converts. It does so by firstly exploring the problem of
   instrumental conversions and subsequently contextualising them through
   the 2021 Liverpool bombing case study. The findings based on a survey
   and interviews with key stakeholders confirm that instrumental
   conversions do not exclude engagement in political violence and that
   conversions to rather than from Christianity should also be taken into
   consideration when formulating policy responses.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {78},
Number = {1},
Pages = {103-133},
Abstract = {Does whataboutism work in global affairs? When states face international
   criticism, they often respond with whataboutism: accusing their critics
   of similar faults. Despite its prevalence in policy discussions,
   whataboutism remains an understudied influence strategy. This study
   investigates how states use whataboutism to shape American public
   opinion across various international issues. We find, using survey
   experiments, that whataboutism mitigates the negative impacts of
   criticism by reducing public approval of US positions and backing for
   punitive actions. Whataboutist critiques referencing similar, recent
   misdeeds have more power to shape opinions. However, the identity of the
   whataboutist state does not significantly affect effectiveness. US
   counter-messaging often fails to diminish the effects of whataboutism.
   These results show that whataboutism can be a potent rhetorical tool in
   international relations and that it warrants greater attention from
   international relations scholars.},
