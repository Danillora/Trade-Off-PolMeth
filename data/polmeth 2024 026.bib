Abstract = {In 1930s Romania, Zionist youth organizations saw a resurgence amid
   increasing antisemitism and the global political mobilization of young
   people. These organizations underwent specific stages, throughout the
   totalitarian regimes of the Second World War, including a semi-legal
   period during the beginnings of the oppression, followed by an
   underground phase from 1942 onwards. This shift occurred when the Jewish
   Federation was replaced by the Jewish Council (Centrala), a
   state-controlled entity representing the Jewish community. This paper
   explores the clandestine Zionist non-armed resistance efforts carried
   out by youth organizations in Romania from 1942 to 1944, drawing on
   archives from the Romanian Secret Police (Siguranta). Focusing on the
   support received from Jewish networks abroad, the discussion highlights
   the actions of the Gordonia and Dror youth organizations. Notably,
   members of these groups faced convictions by the Court Martial in 1944
   for aiding refugee Jews in crossing the Romanian border and preparing
   for emigration to Palestine. The argument posits that these acts of
   defiance constituted a form of Jewish resistance. The overall research
   endeavour seeks to provide a comprehensive history of Jewish youth
   activism during tumultuous times-an often-overlooked aspect in the
   broader narrative of the Holocaust in Romania.},

Abstract = {The article begins and ends with a discussion of the censuses of East
   Central Europe before and after the First World War. Both the former and
   the latter were contested by minority activists despite the enormous
   changes brought about by the post-war settlement. This paradox can be
   explained, at least in part, through selected case studies that
   illustrate the asynchronicity of political, economic, and social
   transformations. The text discusses first the dynamics of this change:
   nationalist mobilization in the face of the refugee problem and local
   military conflicts. Second, it raises the question of the legitimacy of
   the consolidating national states in the region, especially the
   desperate and often futile appeals to the population to support the
   young states in their fight against the national and Bolshevik enemies.
   Both processes resulted in the construction of national majorities,
   albeit at different rates. The social and mental changes brought about
   by war, forced migration, and revolution proceeded much more slowly than
   the transformation of political discourses, and even more slowly than
   the language of ethnic statistics in the service of national states.},

Abstract = {The paper investigates factors associated with armed forces personnel's
   resilience in the face of hybrid interference targeted primarily against
   the cognitive domain. Building on the established conceptualisation of
   resilience as comprising institutional and national dimensions, it
   examines how education levels, socio-economic satisfaction, and job
   satisfaction relate to dimensions of resilience. Using data from a
   survey conducted among 884 members of the Czech Armed Forces, the study
   reveals complex relationships between these factors and resilience.
   While socioeconomic satisfaction correlates with both dimensions of
   resilience, job satisfaction appears to be an intervening variable
   explaining this correlation. The relationship between education and
   resilience is more complex with a lack of monotonicity but significant
   differences between some educational groups. While respondents without
   high school diplomas show significantly lower resilience scores than
   other groups, the relation becomes more ambiguous with increasing
   education. The paper underlines the importance of a multidimensional
   approach to resilience and provides groundwork for future research on
   how individual factors might relate to resilience enhancement. These
   findings could inform strategies to strengthen the armed forces'
   readiness against hybrid interference.},

Abstract = {The year 2024 marks 20 years since Poland joined the European Union. In
   this paper, the authors review the economic literature analysing the
   long-term economic effects of Poland's membership in the EU. Their study
   is based on international and Polish literature referring mainly to
   partial and general equilibrium analyses. They show both the sectoral
   effects, as related to different EU policies, as well as the overall
   consequences of membership for the level of welfare of Polish society.
   The authors first discuss the trade effects in the context of the
   removal of barriers to the movement of goods within the Single European
   Market. Next, the consequences of the inflow of funds from the EU budget
   which finance the country's structural funds and the Common Agricultural
   Policy, which are of particular importance to the Polish economy are
   discussed. A review of the consequences of the inflow of foreign direct
   investment from EU countries to Poland and the effects of labour
   migration within the EU is then conducted. A review of the related
   welfare consequences by aggregating the effects of individual policies
   and making an overall assessment based on a synthetic control method is
   then summarised. The authors then refer to their estimations showing
   that, thanks to EU accession, Poland's GDP per capita 15 years after
   accession was higher by almost 55\% compared to the counterfactual
   scenario of non-accession.},

Abstract = {This article examines Crimean Tatar perceptions of `homeland' and
   `return' following the 2014 annexation of Crimea, contrasting these
   views with those of Crimean Tatars in exile after the 1944 deportation.
   I argue that while nearly all aspects of homeland perception among
   exiled Crimean Tatars-such as an identity marker, a mythologized final
   destination, and the place where their community reside-are still
   evident in the narratives of those displaced after 2014, their emphasis
   and meaning have shifted. For those displaced post-2014, Crimea is
   primarily viewed as the place where their community lives and where most
   aspire to return. This article is based on interviews with Crimean Tatar
   internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ukraine and forced migrants
   abroad, contributing to broader discussions on agency, displacement and
   belonging.},

CDC and an international cohort of experts on this topic insist that it not possible using currently available methods. However, some scholars and activists claim that the science behind this statement is immaterial in the hands of over-zealous actors. I explore aspects of this controversy in the pages that follow, but it is not a central focus.

Title = {The Atypical Forms of Employment Acceptance by Polish Full-Time
   Employees as per Modern Labour Market Rules in an EU-Country Context},
Journal = {STUDIA EUROPEJSKIE-STUDIES IN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS},

Abstract = {This manuscript is dedicated to atypical forms of employment which are a
   response to transactional relations between the employee and the
   employer on the modern labour market. The general research question is
   whether employees who accept atypical forms of employment (or ``AFE{''};
   readiness to providing work) obtain benefits in the form of high
   employability and well-being as well as low levels of job insecurity.
   The assumptions and the research scheme are new compared to previous
   studies. A quantitative CAWI study was conducted on a sample of Polish
   full-time employees (N = 543), as potentially voluntarily declaring
   their acceptance of AFE. In addition, well-being was operationalised
   according to C. Ryff `s approach as a sense of agency in the creation of
   the professional environment. The respondents were divided into two
   groups - those accepting AFE and those accepting traditional, long-term
   employment, in reference to the concept of transactional and relational
   psychological contract. The regression analysis shows that the first
   group had a high level of employability. However, they achieved low
   levels of well-being, and job insecurity was not significant. These are
   individuals in managerial positions in the private sector. On the other
   hand, the group that accepts the traditional form of relationships are
   public sector employees and have high job insecurity only. An important
   determinant of the acceptance of AFE is the so-called `Big Five trait'
   openness. In addition, the level of acceptance decreases with age.
   Gender and education are not statistically significant.
   The focus in this paper on full-time employees, and the benefits of AFE,
   fill the research gap in this area. It also delivers recommendations for
   labour market practices and policy on how to support employees on the
   modern labour market in EU countries.},

Abstract = {In order to analyze the influence of sub-national actors on
   international organizations, this paper uses a questionnaire to survey
   the level of participation and influence of local governments. As
   substate actors, local governments have their responsibilities and
   obligations to influence state behaviour in a variety of ways. Local
   governments need to do the following: the influence and status of
   substate actors on international organizations, whether local
   governments are sub-state actors and their influence on state behavior,
   and the uncertain influence of local governments and states on
   international organizations. The results show that local actors play a
   secondary role in influencing international organizations, and that
   local governments are one of the local actors and have a supervisory and
   binding role on state behavior. The impact of local government and
   national uncertainty on international organizations is largely based on
   the outcome of local government involvement. Therefore, it is the state
   actors who are able to fulfil the responsibilities of international
   organizations and are participants in the relevant work of international
   organizations, in which the influence of local government participation
   on international organizations is more significant.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the literature on differentiated European
   integration by investigating the diversified institutional outcomes
   generated by treaty changes. Its goal is to present how the roles
   attributed to the institution of the EU Council Rotating Presidency have
   changed, in a diversified way, after the reform of the Lisbon Treaty
   concluded in 2009. It posits that while the expected changes altered
   some of the roles in significant manner - as compared to what was
   defined in the treaty - some other roles remained relatively stable. The
   analysis goes beyond reading the Reform Treaty of Lisbon, and rather
   focuses on the perceptions and expectations (via a so-called ``logic of
   appropriateness{''}) towards the Presidency as conceptualised by experts
   on the matter. The shift in perceptions regarding the roles of the
   rotating Presidency is analysed in relation to the roles attached to the
   established institution of the Permanent President of the European
   Council as well as being tested along different levels of the council
   system and its areas of competence. As a result, this study delivers a
   map of roles (understood as the expected behaviour in a given
   institutional setting) according to their salience, level, and the
   competence area of the Council system. The explanatory variables
   employed make distinctions between old vs. new, and big vs. small Member
   States, which makes it possible to identify the relatively important
   differences in the roles ascribed to chairing Member States of varying
   sizes and ages.},

Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The Russia-Ukraine war presented an unintended chance to assess the
   British strategic posture regarding deep fires. The deployment of guided
   rocket artillery systems by Ukrainian forces in 2022 altered the land
   battle dynamics significantly, especially with the modern Western deep
   fires by the US, UK, and France. This study analyses the evolution of
   the UK defence policy and land force structure and the impact of deep
   fires in the first phase of the war, and discusses challenges ahead of
   Britain due to the ongoing conflict. This perspective might apply to
   other cases, including Brazil, as we drew upon critiques mainly directed
   to the over-reliance on technology over combat mass due to the
   re-emergence of conventional warfare.},

   {[}Anonymous], David Barry The Howard line of the Trumbull family with respects to Gale Cottage and its contents Pauline Howard These archives primarily contain hand-written letters. As made clear in The Union of the Two Henrys, the placement of material in the narrative hues to the letters' chronology of composition. Any information taken from a source that is more than a few weeks removed from a moment in the story, even if it directly references that moment, is explicitly noted as part of the narrative. Limiting my use of sources to those of a particular moment in the story helps more accurately capture thought and feeling as it subtly shapes the world. As I also note in the narrative, quoting form a source and then discussing the ``meaning{''} of demarcated words is simply inadequate to the task of capturing feeling and the process of thought. This method of argumentation is also antithetical to understanding how desire works in the world, including how a union of people actually cohere. The conversations I encourage between scholars and readers are those that bear on the interpretation of primary source material and the materiality of real people's lives. I encourage anyone who is interested in how Trumbull ordered his words and sentences to return to the letters of a particular moment in the story. They will slowly realize that the words and sentences immediately surrounding it do not necessarily explain their meaning more clearly. I would encourage them to keep reading what comes before and after until there are no more letters left to read. At that point they will have their own story to tell. The letters in all the collections, except those held by David Barry, are filed in chronological order and so it would be easy for another researcher to remain in conversation with my narrative as they work to persuade us all of their new story..

Abstract = {Financialisation is one of the most prominent economic developments of
   the past half century in the advanced democracies. While the existing
   literature focuses on financial deregulation and liberalisation as the
   key policy changes driving financialisation, this paper contends that
   tax policy also plays a crucial role. More specifically, we argue that
   cuts to taxes on top incomes disproportionately benefit the financial
   sector, as it pays unusually high salaries and employs a highly mobile
   labour force, both domestically and internationally. As a consequence,
   the finance industry gains more from top income tax cuts than other
   industries. A difference-in-differences analysis covering 20 countries
   in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
   from 1970 to 2019 provides strong evidence that cuts in top income tax
   rates increase the (relative) size of the financial sector. A
   complementary time-series cross-sectional analysis finds that these
   effects are even greater in more financially globalised economies.},

Abstract = {International financial institutions (IFIs) are central actors shaping
   global development. Scholarship on these institutions' governance has
   primarily explored unequal voting rights and informal channels of
   decision-making. Much less is known about the actual decision-making
   processes that transpire in the IFIs' formal governance structures,
   where votes are rarely taken. This article redirects academic scrutiny
   to these structures to reveal hitherto unobserved state behavior.
   Empirically, we examine decision-making at the International Monetary
   Fund (IMF), a key actor in the diffusion of market-oriented reforms. We
   introduce a novel dataset systematizing all comments of IMF Executive
   Board members over 3,111 developing-country-specific discussions between
   1995 and 2015. First, regression analysis reveals that the interventions
   by the IMF's most powerful member-states-the United States, Germany,
   Japan, France, and the United Kingdom-correlate with their bilateral
   trade and aid interests. Second, these countries frequently reference
   each other in debates, demonstrating how coalitions work in practice.
   Third, we find that the preferences they express for market
   liberalization vis-\& agrave;-vis countries in the Global South are
   associated with an increase in market-liberalizing conditions in
   subsequent lending programs. Taken together, this article reveals the
   usefulness of examining formal deliberations in IFIs, contributing to a
   fuller understanding of decision-making processes in the international
   political economy.},

Abstract = {In this article, I investigate the relationship between regional
   export-dependence and the outcomes of popular votes that are relevant to
   the interests of business actors, as they relate to the issue of
   international competitiveness. I establish a theoretical framework
   inspired by literatures on trade exposure and growth models. I show that
   in an export-led country such as Switzerland, voters from
   export-dependent regions, presumably particularly sensitive to the
   question of competitiveness, tend to vote in a way that matches the
   expressed preferences of organized business. I also explore how
   vote-level factors and region-level factors condition the main
   relationship of interest, and find that it is particularly strong in the
   context of votes on tax policy, as well as in regions where unemployment
   is consistently low. This article contributes to several literatures. It
   contributes to ongoing debates in the trade exposure literature between
   the proponents of the compensation hypothesis and those of an
   alternative hypothesis centered around competitiveness. It makes a key
   contribution to the growth model (GM) literature by highlighting the
   importance of the regional dimension of GMs for the politics of
   export-led growth. Furthermore, these contributions are also relevant to
   the economic voting literature and the field of international political
   economy (IPE) in general.},

Abstract = {In the last ten years, feminist movements have seen a global resurgence,
   with massive protest campaigns addressing gender-based violence,
   Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Queer rights (LGBTQ+ rights), health and
   reproductive rights, migration, and labour market issues, all influenced
   by intersecting oppressions. This article examines the incorporation of
   intersectionality into contemporary feminist movements in Italy,
   particularly through the lens of Non Una Di Meno. Drawing on social
   movement studies, the article explores how intersectionality has been
   adapted to address Italy's unique feminist challenges. It investigates
   both the discontinuities brought by the intersectional perspective and
   the historical continuities with Italian feminist traditions. Through an
   analysis of collective framing, strategies and forms of action, this
   study highlights how intersectionality has catalysed innovation in
   Italian feminist movements, addressing complex social injustices while
   maintaining a strong anti-capitalist stance. The findings emphasize the
   importance of inclusive practices and the ongoing need for
   self-reflexivity in implementing intersectional approaches.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship has revealed the rapid post-1980s growth, dramatic
   scope, and socio-economic consequences of multinational enterprises'
   (MNEs) corporate tax avoidance and tax haven use. But why did social
   scientists only start systematically studying these dynamics in the
   2010s? This is especially puzzling for International Political Economy
   (IPE) given that early IPE, in the 1970s, centered analyses of MNEs and
   their tax affairs under a rubric that Charles Kindleberger called
   `corporate escape'. Drawing on a collective oral history from pioneer
   interviews, historical documents, and bibliometric analysis, we identify
   two factors that explain the 1970s origins, the late-century fall, and
   the recent rise, of corporate escape studies: engagement with
   transdisciplinary technical knowledge of MNEs, and interaction with the
   politicization of MNEs. We explain how researchers abandoned the
   corporate escape agenda in the 1980s-1990s, losing technical insights
   from cognate disciplines and institutions, and refocusing around
   economistic and macro-structural analyses. These factors also elucidate
   why corporate escape studies only fully reinvigorated in the 2010s with
   political tailwinds and renewed investments in transdisciplinarity.
   These insights contribute to debates on IPE history and research,
   reintroduce MNEs as key meso-level institutions, and underscore the
   importance of historical awareness for studying corporate (mis)conduct
   and global inequalities.},

Abstract = {Like other regions of the world, academic freedom is on the decline in
   Africa. While there are some generic factors accounting for this
   phenomenon worldwide, others are fundamentally unique to the African
   context. These are related principally to the subject matter of
   coloniality of higher education on the continent. This study addresses
   these matters by, among others, discussing the origins of the university
   in pre-modern Africa and the place of academic freedom in it. This
   development is followed by the emergence of university education in
   Europe through the application of the liberal script and which
   contributed to the sidelining and eventual general demise of higher
   education institutions with their roots in pre-modern Africa. The work
   contends that while one may trace the origins of the university/academic
   freedom to Africa, academic freedom as it stands today is shaped by the
   liberal script with hardly any reference to the root of higher education
   in Africa. Therefore, the meaning, understanding and application of
   academic freedom do not reflect the realities of higher education in
   Africa. This work proposes the adoption of a relative universalist
   approach, as opposed to the liberal approach, which is clothed with
   universality, but in reality, it is a reflection of a European idea of
   academic freedom. This approach is considered necessary to reflect the
   African reality of academic freedom which will help to identify
   effective advocacy tools to promote and protect academic freedom in
   Africa and thereby make academic freedom more meaningful for application
   in the region.},

   interactions between national, sub-national and EU levels. At the same
   time, principles of bounded rationality are entering the public policy
   debate, highlighting the role of cognitive biases in policy formation.
   However, these two developments have been separate, as bounded
   rationality has been little used in EU studies. The article therefore
   proposes a framework integrating the two lenses. This sheds new light on
   the optimal allocation of tasks between EU and national levels, given
   the prevalence of different cognitive biases at each level. Findings are
   that EU-level policy-making can be hampered by availability heuristics
   and undefined preferences, whilst national policy-making is prone to
   zero-sum bias and myopia. Insights are applied to research policy as an
   example, helping to explain obstacles to EU integration in this area.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To carry out a critical review of the state of the art of
   transparency, good administration and good government on the occasion of
   the tenth anniversary of the approval of the Spanish Law on Transparency
   and Good Government. Methodology: In order to build a systematic and
   comprehensive study of the subject, the research is guided by a legal,
   doctrinal and jurisprudential analysis of the elements that affect two
   key pillars of open government policies: transparency and collaboration
   (the latter concept includes integrity and accountability). It also
   analyses the impact of the principle of good administration in the
   administrative process in the light of recent case law. The method used
   is comparative, taking as a sample the regulations of the State and
   those of Extremadura. Results: The research reveals several shortcomings
   and excesses that should be taken into account in future legislative
   reforms, both at the level of the State and of the Autonomous
   Communities. Conclusions: It is considered necessary to amend Law
   19/2013, of 9 December 2013, in order to integrate the jurisprudence of
   the Spanish Supreme Court and to correct the shortcomings of the
   regulatory technique. Likewise, it is concluded that it would be
   appropriate to regulate a special regime of access to public information
   applicable to those subjects that play a decisive role in the formation
   of public opinion. At the regional level, the main conclusion is that a
   recast of the legislation on transparency and good governance is
   recommended. With regard to good administration, it would be advisable
   for the State legislator to expressly recognise the right to good
   administration, in line with the CDFUE, the regional regulations and the
   jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court. Finally, the technique used
   to regulate the principles of good governance and the codes of conduct
   is criticised, as is the lack of objective and binding evaluations to
   determine the degree of compliance.},

Abstract = {Degrowth has become particularly important in the environmental movement
   in recent years. However, there is no consensus on how to achieve the
   shift from a growth-oriented society to a degrowth-oriented society. We
   suggest that a productive means of addressing this issue is by turning
   to debates concerning processes of institutional change and
   sustainability transitions. This approach has two key implications. On
   the one hand, accounts of degrowth transitions resonate with broader
   theories of institutional change. For instance, some, in common with
   historical institutionalism, emphasise the path dependencies of existing
   growth-oriented institutions while others, in common with discursive
   institutionalism, highlight the role of ideas in facilitating the
   creation of a degrowth-oriented society. On the other hand, there are
   serious limitations to these theories of institutional change. From the
   perspective of critical political economy, they fail to situate
   institutions in the broader context of capitalist power dynamics and
   thus do not engage with social interests. On the basis of two case
   studies, we argue that degrowth needs to address the question `who wants
   degrowth?', or how its demands advance the interests of the working
   class, with its different intersections, in the contemporary moment.},

Abstract = {The article explores how the ideology of Putin's regime is configured
   depending on the purposes for which it is used. It examines how the
   Kremlin's attempt to mobilize the nation through ideology after the
   full-scale invasion of Ukraine aligns with its broader strategies of
   utilizing ideology. To understand variations in the Kremlin's discourse,
   the study contrasts two conceptual configurations: patriotic statism
   (state as the ultimate value, requiring citizens to make sacrifices) and
   welfare statism (state as a means to provide people's well-being). This
   framework enables us to analyze how different configurations of Putin's
   ideology are employed in various political genres. The analysis reveals
   that while the genres of ideological proclamation, ideological
   indoctrination, and declarative justification are dominated by patriotic
   statism, welfare statism proves essential for the genre of mobilizing
   invocation. When Putin aims to mobilize the nation, the promises of
   welfare appear more reliable than mere rhetoric of patriotic
   self-sacrifice.},

Abstract = {This article inquires the individual and collective agency of female
   migrant domestic workers in Spain. I use fieldwork conducted between
   2013 and 2023 to examine the interplay between the migrant workers'
   individual coping strategies, the claims-making strategies of the
   domestic workers' trade union Sindihogar, and the structures they
   operate within and attempt to challenge. Drawing on contemporary
   research about precarious workers' movements, I aim to explore to what
   extent this social movement union has the potential to reduce the power
   of structural constraints and increase the power of agency. Implicit is
   a broader, more provocative question: To what extent is substantial
   change possible within the current political-economic order, here
   defined as late neoliberalism? I found that while the movement's
   community-building approach may empower activists at an individual
   level, there are significant structural barriers to its potential to
   accomplish change in terms of better job conditions for this highly
   precarious workforce. In addition, I suggest that an increasing focus on
   precarious workers' ``resilience{''} risks undermining narratives of
   structural transformation.
   Cet article s'int \& eacute;resse \& agrave; la repr \& eacute;sentation
   individuelle et collective des travailleuses domestiques migrantes en
   Espagne. Je m'appuie sur un travail de terrain men \& eacute; entre 2013
   et 2023 pour examiner l'interaction entre les strat \& eacute;gies
   individuelles d'adaptation des travailleuses migrantes, les strat \&
   eacute;gies de revendication du syndicat des travailleuses domestiques
   Sindihogar ainsi que les structures dans lesquelles elles op \&
   egrave;rent et qu'elles tentent de remettre en question. \& Agrave;
   partir des recherches contemporaines sur les mouvements de travailleurs
   pr \& eacute;caires, je vise \& agrave; identifier dans quelle mesure ce
   syndicat de mouvement social a le potentiel de r \& eacute;duire le
   pouvoir des contraintes structurelles et d'augmenter le pouvoir de la
   repr \& eacute;sentation. Une question plus large et plus provocante se
   pose implicitement : Dans quelle mesure un changement significatif
   est-il possible dans l'ordre politico-\& eacute;conomique actuel, d \&
   eacute;fini ici comme le n \& eacute;olib \& eacute;ralisme tardif ?
   J'ai constat \& eacute; que si l'approche du mouvement ax \& eacute;e
   sur le renforcement de la communaut \& eacute; peut permettre aux
   militants de s'\& eacute;manciper au niveau individuel, il existe des
   obstacles structurels importants \& agrave; son potentiel de changement
   en mati \& egrave;re d'am \& eacute;lioration des conditions d'emploi
   pour cette main-d'oe uvre tr \& egrave;s pr \& eacute;caire. En outre,
   je sugg \& egrave;re qu'en mettant de plus en plus l'accent sur la << r
   \& eacute;silience >> des travailleurs pr \& eacute;caires, nous
   risquons d'affaiblir les r \& eacute;cits de transformation
   structurelle.
   Este art \& iacute;culo investiga la agencia, tanto individual como
   colectiva, de las trabajadoras dom \& eacute;sticas migrantes en Espa \&
   ntilde;a. Utilizamos el trabajo de campo llevado a cabo entre 2013 y
   2023 con el fin de estudiar la interacci \& oacute;n entre las
   estrategias de afrontamiento individuales de las trabajadoras migrantes,
   las estrategias a nivel reivindicativo del sindicato de trabajadoras del
   hogar, Sindihogar, y las estructuras en las que operan y las cuales
   intentan desafiar. Partimos de la base de la investigaci \& oacute;n
   contempor \& aacute;nea sobre los movimientos de trabajadores precarios
   con el objetivo de estudiar hasta qu \& eacute; punto este sindicato de
   movimiento social tiene alg \& uacute;n potencial para poder reducir el
   poder de las restricciones estructurales y para aumentar el poder de
   agencia. Sin embargo, impl \& iacute;citamente, existe una cuesti \&
   oacute;n m \& aacute;s amplia y m \& aacute;s provocadora: \&
   iquest;Hasta qu \& eacute; punto es posible que se produzca un cambio
   sustancial dentro del orden pol \& iacute;tico-econ \& oacute;mico
   actual, definido aqu \& iacute; como neoliberalismo tard \& iacute;o?
   Concluimos que, si bien el enfoque de construcci \& oacute;n comunitaria
   del movimiento puede empoderar a los activistas a nivel individual,
   existen barreras estructurales significativas con relaci \& oacute;n a
   su potencial que dificultan poder lograr cambios relativos a unas
   mejores condiciones laborales para esta fuerza laboral altamente
   precaria. Adem \& aacute;s, sugerimos que el hecho de poner el foco,
   cada vez m \& aacute;s, en la << resiliencia >> por parte de los
   trabajadores precarios puede causar el riesgo de da \& ntilde;ar las
   narrativas de transformaci \& oacute;n estructural.},

Abstract = {Finance plays an increasing role in the global governance of
   sustainability. To explain the rise of finance, scholarship is
   increasingly turning to the financial sector as a producer of
   policy-relevant knowledge. However, scholarship has paid little
   attention to how differences within the financial sector affect such
   knowledge production. This article differentiates two important ways how
   the financial sector addresses sustainability: investments following
   environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards, and impact
   investing. Whereas diversified ESG investing is centered around index
   and data providers, impact investors manage non-listed assets and
   develop idiosyncratic `impact' approaches. I introduce the term
   `epistemic gerrymandering' to describe how impact investors tailor
   `impact' to their financial portfolios and to explain how the resulting
   heterogeneity and ambiguity is stabilized. Tracing the historical
   development of impact investing from three distinct strands into a
   transnational club, I argue that the club structure, together with
   impact investors' proximity to private wealth management, explains the
   persistence of epistemic gerrymandering. As a knowledge regime,
   epistemic gerrymandering reinforces three dynamics of particular
   importance to political economists: the subjugation of sustainability to
   financial returns, the restriction of access to epistemic arenas to
   wealthy elites, and the rechanneling of charitable and public resources
   to de-risk private investments.},

Abstract = {Prior literature highlights democracies' struggle to cope with today's
   rapid socio-economic changes, contrasting with more adept responses in
   authoritarian systems. This study makes a first attempt to explain the
   perceived speediness in an authoritarian setting. By focusing on
   Beijing's digital service request system, Jiesu Jiban, we argue that in
   creating request categories, standardizing cadres' reactions to
   requests, and designing decision pathways, Jiesu Jiban is not only an
   instrument to deal with increasing complexity and acceleration of
   socio-economic development, but the system itself also creates
   acceleration. It does so by categorizing, specifying, and standardizing
   service requests and response procedures and by channeling these through
   a digital infrastructure. We show that the datafication of governing
   citizens' request increases pressure for frontline administrators
   co-producing a system of responsibility without accountability for the
   central government.},

Abstract = {This article presents a systematic empirical analysis of the career
   patterns of all 3634 members of the European Parliament (MEPs) who
   served in the European Parliament (EP) over the last 40 years
   (1979-2019). It explains how changes in the EP's structure of
   opportunities have shaped the development of MEPs' career patterns.
   First, we show that the development of a European political class is not
   a recent trend but that this process took place in the early days of the
   EP (as soon as in the 1984-1989 term), albeit with variance across
   political groups of the European Parliament (EPGs) and Member States.
   Second, we observe that the transformation of party systems and
   electoral volatility have been questioning the existence of the European
   political class. Overall, we conclude that legislative institutions are
   only as strong as the individuals who are called to serve them. Recent
   rises in the EP's turnover could ultimately undermine the EP's formal
   policy-making capacity in the middle and long terms.},

Abstract = {Studies of the political economy of decarbonisation have begun to move
   beyond the price-centrism of neoclassical economics to explore the role
   of profits in propelling, or failing to propel, a green transformation.
   This article pushes this argument further, claiming with Marx that the
   focus on profits is useful insofar as it leads us to a broader analysis
   of the capitalist dynamics of competition, overaccumulation, and crisis
   that any green transition will have to reckon with. This is illustrated
   through an historical study of the steel industry - a prodigious carbon
   emitter that must be urgently greened. This article traces the
   interwoven patterns of crisis and technological change in steelmaking
   through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, before drawing out
   certain core themes that then serve as a lens through which to analyze
   the prospects of steel decarbonisation today. Since its modern birth,
   technological revolutions in steelmaking have generated and in turn been
   conditioned by crises of overaccumulation and restructuring. These same
   forces are shaping the drive to decarbonise the industry today, as vital
   green investments are obstructed by reoccurring cycles of overcapacity
   and weak profitability. Greening steelmaking, and capitalism more
   generally, means wrangling with this boom-and-bust logic and its
   political ramifications.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Abstract = {Global South countries (excluding China) need USD 40 trillion in
   infrastructure finance by 2035. Most of this must be sourced externally.
   The US's Partnership on Global Infrastructure and Investment, the EU's
   Global Gateway, and China's Belt and Road Initiative all aim to provide
   parts of this capital. Conceptualising the state-capital relation of the
   US's approach, the `Wall Street Consensus' appoints host countries to
   catalyse private capital by de-risking infrastructure projects. Here, I
   conduct a comparative study of the state-capital relationships within
   the financing models of the three initiatives, drawing from 123
   interviews conducted across the global North and South, official
   documents, and existing literature on infrastructure finance. I find
   that while the three models assign different roles to host countries,
   they all entail a heavy financial risk burden. Highlighting differences
   between initiatives, I conceptualise the US's model as `host country
   de-risking', the EU's as `ODA bargained de-risking', and China's as
   `state-organised risk-sharing'. Positioned between these models, I find
   that global South countries face a dilemma between the need for a `green
   state' approach to drive infrastructure development and pressure for a
   limited risk-carrying state role imposed by the three models.},

Abstract = {Constitutional reform in the European Union suffers from a
   post-functionalist dilemma: the options that are politically viable are
   not democratically legitimate and the options that are democratically
   legitimate are not politically viable. Against the background of the
   recent Conference on the Future of Europe and the involvement of
   transnational European Citizens' Panels, this article asks whether there
   is any prospect of overcoming this dilemma and organizing fundamental
   reform of EU institutions that is both normatively legitimate and
   politically viable. For this, it examines four models of EU treaty
   reform and the way these have figured in actual EU reform processes:
   Intergovernmental Conference, European Convention, informal
   intergovernmentalism and a Citizens Convention. The article concludes
   that, as long as the European Union is best characterized as a
   `demoi-cracy' in which political deliberation takes place primarily in
   national public spheres, the Intergovernmental Conference remains its
   main and inevitable forum for constitutional reform. Hence, alternative
   models of EU constitutional reform should be evaluated not so much on
   the basis of their potential to substitute the IGC but rather on their
   ability to catalyse the process and to pre-commit the member state
   governments.},

Abstract = {Twenty-five years ago, we argued that it would be possible to reduce
   incarceration and use the resultant savings for investments in preschool
   education, which would further lower the crime rate. In this article, we
   revisit that line of thinking, surveying recent literature on the cost
   and efficacy of prisons and preschool education for crime reduction. We
   find that the new evidence strengthens our earlier conclusion about the
   feasibility of this thought experiment. The costs (in real dollars) of
   prison are higher than 25 years ago, and prisons are slightly less
   effective at reducing or preventing crime. In addition, the evidence
   shows broader and stronger effects of preschool on crime and in programs
   operating at a much larger scale than the programs we previously
   evaluated.},

Abstract = {A growing body of research on evidence-based crime prevention draws
   attention to a pressing need for these crime prevention programs,
   policies, and practices to do more to bring about social impact and
   social justice. Crime prevention that prioritizes social impact is about
   harnessing the knowledge of evidence-based interventions and fostering
   systems change that is both meaningful and lasting. This approach
   includes targeting the social and environmental conditions that lead to
   criminal activity, building on existing strengths and assets, and
   tailoring evidence-based practices to local conditions. Social justice
   in this context equitably delivers crime prevention resources, and
   promotes perceptions of fairness and legitimacy among individuals and
   the community at large. In this introduction, we lay out the ideals,
   challenges, and progress of crime prevention for social impact and
   social justice and summarize the conclusions of the other articles in
   this volume of The ANNALS.},

Abstract = {Traditional ways of measuring sex and gender - often by conflating the
   two - have been criticized on empirical and normative grounds. This
   article presents the results of 15 focus groups conducted in Canada in
   2016 that were motivated by two questions: How do people think about
   gender and how can this inform or refine current approaches to the
   measurement of gender? Several patterns emerged. First, participants
   seem to understand gender most often in the context of gendered roles
   and responsibilities, with physical appearances or traits playing
   secondary roles. Second, the salience of gender tends to be highest at
   home and in the workplace. Third, ethnicity/race, age, and sexual
   orientation are, predictably, important lenses through which individuals
   perceive and experience gender. Fourth, focus groups provide important
   opportunities for reflection on and improvement of gender measurement in
   survey research, including the different context-dependent factors that
   go into gender identity and the need for multi-dimensional measures.
   Taken together, findings help identify tangible practices that could be
   adopted for enhancing measurement of gender in survey research.},

Abstract = {The conflict that arose between Soviet Armenia and Soviet Azerbaijan
   over Nagorno-Karabakh in 1988 festered throughout the final years of the
   Soviet Union and sparked a major war between the newly independent
   Armenia and Azerbaijan in 1992-1994. Most accounts of this period have
   suggested that the administration of George H. W. Bush took a largely
   hands-off approach to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, but this article
   shows that in fact the Bush administration pursued a much more active
   policy that reflected support for the Soviet Union and then Russia, a
   strong domestic Armenian-American lobby, and regional priorities, as
   well as a growing awareness of the West's failure to stem violence in
   Yugoslavia. The Bush administration was hoping to prevent all-out war
   between Armenia and Azerbaijan, but after the war began, the
   administration did what it could to try to limit and halt the violence.},

Abstract = {Abortion is a ``public secret{''} in Latin America. It is highly
   restricted across most of the continent and yet millions of abortions
   take place every year. We use the sociological framework of ``strategic
   ignorance{''} to argue that convenient not knowing, erasure, and
   concealment simultaneously prevent and facilitate abortions in Latin
   America. By drawing on interviews with people involved in abortion
   activism and access across the continent, we examine three sets of
   actors: the state, abortion providers, and individuals seeking
   abortions. When wielded by the state, strategic ignorance reproduces the
   status quo of the criminalization of abortion; however, when wielded by
   abortion providers and individuals seeking abortions, it creates the
   conditions for ``clandestine{''} abortions to be procured without
   prosecution. Strategic ignorance is therefore mobilized by the powerful
   as well as the less powerful who are resisting state control of their
   fertility and reproductive lives.},

Abstract = {European regulatory co-operation has become essential for the smooth
   operation of the single market, and this in turn requires trust. In the
   case of the European Union (EU) `Undertakings for Collective Investment
   in Transferable Securities' (UCITS) Directive, for example, the member
   states' financial supervisory authorities rely on each other to provide
   a harmonised regime for the sale of investment funds across the EU.
   Funds authorised in one member state can be sold freely in another
   member state without further authorisation. The national authorities
   need to trust each other to ensure a consistent application of EU law.
   Yet we know very little about how trust matters from the perspective of
   member state regulators. In this article, we provide a better
   understanding of the relevant components of trust in the single market
   in financial services through an in-depth case study of an EU network of
   national financial market supervisory authorities.},

Abstract = {Objectives: The present study addresses an analysis of the economic
   status of the elected members of local entities. Methodology: The
   inductive methodology typical of legal sciences is used, without
   forgetting the historical-legal perspective and, all of this, under the
   technique of dogmatic research de lege ferenda. Results: The problem
   that has arisen since its initial establishment in the 1980s is
   investigated, assessing the institutional performance of the system with
   respect to the principles of good governance that should govern them.
   Conclusions: Different proposals for regulatory improvement are made so
   that, where appropriate, they are taken into account in a possible
   reform of the system.},

Abstract = {The recent fortieth anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the
   Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) has sparked a good deal of reflection and
   retrospection. Looking back, it is clear that the Convention's
   architects carefully navigated, and selectively absorbed, a number of
   competing visions of oceanic governance, from freedom to enclosure to
   visions of Global North-South equality. This made the Convention's
   construction period a very drawn-out and painful one - longer than for
   any other international treaty in history - and while some hopes were
   realized, others were dashed. Forty years on, it is important not to let
   its current canonical status blind us to the fact that the Convention
   came close to being a failure, and that things could have gone
   differently at a number of critical junctures. Nor should it stop us
   asking whether UNCLOS is really fit for purpose today. In this article,
   I situate the Convention within wider developments in the global economy
   and the global environment, and consider the role it has played in
   promoting goals of global justice and environmental protection.},

Abstract = {After a largely successful post-authoritarian transition, Indonesia has
   experienced democratic backsliding since the 2010s. This backsliding
   accelerated under the presidency of Joko Widodo (2014-2024), but it has
   not yet pushed the Indonesian polity into a full-blown autocracy. I
   argue that Indonesia's specific pathway to democratic backsliding
   prefigured this outcome. While elites have colluded to share power and
   allow the president to engage in executive aggrandizement, they have set
   limits to the latter's potential authoritarian ambitions. For example,
   they rejected Widodo's attempt to extend his time in power beyond the
   constitutionally allowed two terms. Thus, elites have both produced
   executive aggrandizement and contained its scope. This pattern has
   protected Indonesian democracy from a full collapse, but it has produced
   a gradual decline, reducing the chances of democratic revitalization
   through formal or contentious politics.},

Abstract = {Since 2014, the \#BlackLivesMatter movement has worked to initiate
   police reforms designed to increase accountability and reduce the
   extrajudicial killing of Black and brown people. However, policy designs
   are typically congruent-meaning the allocation of benefits and burdens
   is generally aligned with how the target group is perceived by society.
   How could the movement motivate policy noncongruent action that would
   likely burden police-a group privileged by their position within a
   congruent, punitive, and racialized criminal justice policy culture? An
   examination of the innovation and diffusion of 12 noncongruent police
   reforms from 2014 to 2020 suggests the movement's demands (1) reoriented
   the political and social contexts that fueled past diffusion processes,
   (2) activated key institutional actors-Black lawmakers-who served as
   entrepreneurs in state institutions, and (3) reactivated innovative
   states to serve as ``leaders{''} in a new wave of noncongruent reform.
   This analysis provides a useful framework to understand how marginalized
   communities and their allies can exact real policy change in a political
   environment known for its unresponsiveness to the demands of
   marginalized groups.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been an upsurge in the number of civilian
   resistance movements (CRMs) within states to counter government
   repression and coups d'\& eacute;tats through which civilians are on the
   frontlines of state brutality and mass atrocities. This article
   considers the implications of CRMs for atrocity prevention and the
   associated responsibility to protect norm by asking, Should the
   international community support CRMs as part of its wider commitment to
   ending mass atrocities? In this article, we evaluate both military and
   nonmilitary support to CRMs. We argue that in the context of coups and
   government repression, providing lethal military support to CRMs will
   often make things worse in terms of atrocity prevention. We however
   explain that the provision by the international community of nonlethal
   and nonmilitary support through political recognition, technical
   assistance, and accountability can yield positive results. We illustrate
   this argument with the case of Myanmar.},

Abstract = {How effective was Soviet secularization and what is its long-term
   legacy? This paper investigates the lasting effects of Khrushchev's
   Virgin Lands Campaign (1950s) on the current level of Orthodox
   religiosity in eastern Russia using an original district (raion)-level
   dataset that combines historical and contemporary evidence. By employing
   various matching techniques and an instrumental variable approach, I
   identify significant effects of the Virgin Lands cultivation on
   diminishing the role of religion even 60 years later. Moreover, I
   demonstrate that the resettlement of Communist Youth League (Komsomol)
   members and the destruction of traditional social relations may have
   worked as key mechanisms that contributed to the legacy effects. This
   study offers one of the first micro-level empirical investigations into
   the impact of Communism-driven secularization, and contributes to the
   emerging inquiry into the historical legacy of communism.},

Abstract = {This article studies how the European Union (EU) influences the dynamics
   between supporters and opponents of market liberalization in partner
   countries. We focus on Ukraine's attempts to safeguard timber trade and
   agricultural land sales from international markets through moratoria
   before 2022. We find that the EU intervenes in domestic debates both
   directly and through domestic pro-market coalitions to frame these
   moratoria as expressions of `vested interests' and instances of state
   weakness. The EU effectively linked the free trade argument with
   protecting the environment (as the moratorium tolerated illegal logging)
   and human rights (as the land moratorium denied landowners their
   property rights). The EU thus fostered discourses and coalitions
   prioritizing liberalization over protectionist interests and
   environmental concerns. This article implies that the EU should
   encourage debates around market liberalization rather than de-legitimize
   opponents, as reconstruction in Ukraine following Russian aggression
   will require both EU assistance and broader internal coalitions.},

Abstract = {American women remain vastly under-represented in positions of political
   power, and researchers have argued that this representational deficit is
   partially due to a political candidacy gap. In this article, we
   investigate the importance of gender identity at a formative moment in
   the development of political ambition. More specifically, we contacted
   thousands of local party leaders, donors, and activists to solicit
   advice for one of two student clubs: one women's group and one
   gender-nonspecific group. Our experiment suggests that overt gender
   identity can lead to greater guidance opportunities - particularly from
   Republican women. Moreover, while the advice offered to the women's club
   was far more likely to be gendered, the advice given to this group did
   not include a greater emphasis on the challenges associated with a
   political career. These findings suggest that organizational gender
   identity can meaningfully affect political mentorship experiences and,
   ultimately, the candidate pipeline.1},

Abstract = {In Colombia, the FARC and the Colombian government have adopted a new
   term, `reincorporation,' to refer to the FARC's simultaneous and
   collective transition into society, in contrast to past programmes in
   which ex-combatants individually transitioned back into civilian society
   (generally known as `reintegration'). This collectivist approach is
   unprecedented in postconflict societies. In this Note from the Field, I
   seek to offer observations about this collective process of
   reintegration based on ethnographic fieldwork and suggest how
   ethnography can reveal new imaginaries for DDR scenarios.},

   United States and their effects on `illegal aliens' through a
   legal-historical approach. To highlight the increasingly expeditious
   nature of border control, I focus on so-called expedited removal
   procedures which leave captured individuals without the time or means
   for lawsuits against such actions. This description is then put into
   perspective through debates that accompanied the emergence of the
   administrative state at the beginning of the 20th century.},

Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Sustainable futures require deep social and economic transformations to
   address climate change adequately. The current landscape of
   intergovernmental and market-based coordination is not delivering this
   outcome. In response, political economic scholarship is congregating
   around the concept of the green state as a corrective to the status quo.
   In spite of this resurgence of interest in the green state, much
   research takes place in issue-specific silos without exploring synergies
   between them. Our contribution is to call for an integrative agenda
   focused on `green economic planning', a form of state-led
   decarbonisation whereby the state designs and implements structural
   complementarities between macro-financial architectures, industrial
   policy, and private sector incentives. Our evidence for this approach is
   taken from historical cases of indicative planning in post-war
   democracies, contemporary cases of sectoral planning by states, and
   finally, planning by multinational corporations. We draw not only on
   political economy but also on scholarship in the fields of business,
   environment, energy and economic history. The upshot is a new research
   agenda focusing on state planning capacity in hierarchical coordination
   institutions and multinational corporations as research laboratories for
   the study of the organisational and technological infrastructure needed
   for state planning.},

Abstract = {In the 2000s, the literature depicted Brazil as an emerging power and a
   regional leader. From time to time, Venezuela was presented as a
   potential contender. Fast-forward to today: Venezuela endures economic
   bankruptcy and demographic collapse, whereas Brazil looks internally
   divided and much diminished on the international scene. Whatever
   happened? This article argues that the emergence of these South American
   states was an illusion created by presidential activism and ostentatious
   summitry, as presidents seized a commodity windfall to make the case for
   greater power status and regional agency. Once the windfall ended,
   successor presidents were unable to deliver on what their antecessors
   had oversold. The rise of the Venezuelan-sponsored Bolivarian
   Alternative for the Peoples of the Americas and the fall of the
   Brazilian-promoted Union of South American Nations are examples of the
   weakness of interpresidentialist region building, as populist presidents
   like Venezuela's Hugo Ch \& aacute;vez and Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro
   contributed either to capriciously devise or abruptly terminate regional
   arrangements.},

Abstract = {While peacekeeping operations have always been heavily dependent on
   host-state support and international political backing, changes in the
   global geopolitical and technological landscapes have presented new
   forms of state interference intended to influence, undermine, and impair
   the activities of missions on the ground. Emerging parallel security
   actors, notably the Wagner Group, have cast themselves as directly or
   implicitly in competition with the security guarantee provided by
   peacekeepers, while the proliferation of mis- and disinformation and
   growing cybersecurity vulnerabilities present novel challenges for
   missions' relationships with host states and populations, operational
   security, and the protection of staff and their local sources. Together,
   these trends undermine missions' efforts to protect civilians, operate
   safely, and implement long-term political settlements. This essay
   analyzes these trends and the dilemmas they present for in-country UN
   officials attempting to induce respect for international norms and
   implement their mandates. It describes nascent strategies taken by
   missions to maintain their impartiality, communicate effectively, and
   maintain the trust of those they are charged with protecting, and
   highlights early good practices for monitoring and analyzing this new
   operation environment, for reporting on and promoting human rights, and
   for operating safely.},

Title = {Mapping China's influence at the United Nations},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 26},
Abstract = {How do emerging powers secure international leadership posts? How do
   these international civil service positions contribute to an emerging
   power's influence in multilateral institutions? Focusing on China as an
   emerging power in the UN system, we find that China forms coalitions
   with other weaker states to control leadership personnel appointments.
   We couple UN voting affinity data with under-utilized
   nationality-leadership data of the UN's six principal organs'
   departments and agencies. States with higher UN General Assembly voting
   affinity with China in turn secure a greater increase in UN leadership
   positions. We then investigate the effect of these bureaucratic
   leadership positions for China's influence, scoping analysis to
   discourse (i.e. aligning liberal diplomatic discourse with PRC
   discourse). Applying text analysis methods to 54 UN departments against
   PRC-produced documentation, we show that China-friendly leadership
   positively correlates with the frequency of PRC-specific terms and
   PRC-reinterpreted words in its reports. Our findings illustrate that
   China wields influence in the UN system, i.e. the worldview of the
   international bureaucrats converges with their perceived principal,
   China. Our project advances research largely focused on United States
   and its allies' influence in the multilateral system, and speaks to a
   limited literature on emerging power's attempts to influence
   multilateral institutions.},

Title = {Nomads' Land: Exploring the Social and Political Life of the Nomad
   Category},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT 17},
Abstract = {The category of the nomad has gained a newfound salience in recent
   decades, ranging from public interest in ``digital nomadism{''} to
   academic debates about ``nomadic theory.{''} Faced with this upsurge of
   interest in nomadism, this collective discussion brings together five
   scholars of diverse theoretical and academic backgrounds to investigate
   the pasts, presents, and possible futures of the nomad category. The
   contributions excavate the conditions under which the category first
   arose in European social and political discourse, explore the historical
   baggage that this category has carried with it into the twenty-first
   century, and inquire under what conditions nomadism has come to be
   regarded as a promising or emancipatory trope. Keeping with the
   open-ended ethos of international political sociology, the aim of the
   collective discussion is not to seek conceptual mastery over the
   category of the nomad, but to foreground the multiple, ambivalent, and
   often contradictory ways in which this category has been deployed
   through space and time. More broadly, the collective discussion is an
   invitation for scholars to explore the international social and
   political lives of our concepts in a way that destabilizes disciplinary
   and institutional boundaries.
   La cat \& eacute;gorie du nomade a endoss \& eacute; une nouvelle
   importance ces derni \& egrave;res d \& eacute;cennies, de l'int \&
   eacute;r \& ecirc;t public pour le << nomadisme num \& eacute;rique >>
   aux d \& eacute;bats acad \& eacute;miques sur la << th \& eacute;orie
   nomade >>. Face \& agrave; ce regain d'int \& eacute;r \& ecirc;t pour
   le nomadisme, cette discussion collective rassemble cinq chercheurs aux
   bagages th \& eacute;oriques et acad \& eacute;miques divers pour enqu
   \& ecirc;ter sur les pass \& eacute;s, pr \& eacute;sents et avenirs
   possibles de la cat \& eacute;gorie nomade. Ces contributions mettent au
   jour les conditions d'apparition de la cat \& eacute;gorie dans le
   discours social et politique europ \& eacute;en, explorent le bagage
   historique que cette cat \& eacute;gorie a emport \& eacute; avec elle
   dans le vingt-et-uni \& egrave;me si \& egrave;cle, et s'interrogent sur
   les conditions qui ont permis au nomadisme d'\& ecirc;tre consid \&
   eacute;r \& eacute; comme un trope prometteur et source d'\&
   eacute;mancipation. Dans la lign \& eacute;e de la philosophie ouverte
   de la sociologie politique internationale, l'objectif de cette
   discussion politique n'est pas de rechercher une ma \& icirc;trise
   conceptuelle de la cat \& eacute;gorie du nomade, mais de mettre en
   avant les multiples fa \& ccedil;ons ambivalentes et souvent
   contradictoires dont cette cat \& eacute;gorie a \& eacute;t \& eacute;
   d \& eacute;ploy \& eacute;e dans l'espace et dans le temps. Plus
   largement, la discussion collective constitue une invitation pour les
   chercheurs \& agrave; explorer les vies sociales et politiques
   internationales de nos concepts d'une fa \& ccedil;on qui d \&
   eacute;stabilise les limites disciplinaires et institutionnelles.
   La categor \& iacute;a de n \& oacute;mada ha ganado una nueva
   prominencia en las \& uacute;ltimas d \& eacute;cadas. Esta prominencia
   incluye desde el inter \& eacute;s p \& uacute;blico con relaci \&
   oacute;n al << nomadismo digital >> hasta los debates acad \&
   eacute;micos sobre la << teor \& iacute;a n \& oacute;mada >>. Frente a
   este aumento del inter \& eacute;s por el nomadismo, esta discusi \&
   oacute;n colectiva re \& uacute;ne a cinco estudiosos, que cuentan con
   antecedentes te \& oacute;ricos y acad \& eacute;micos diversos, con el
   fin de investigar los pasados, presentes y posibles futuros de la
   categor \& iacute;a n \& oacute;mada. Las contribuciones cimientan las
   condiciones bajo las cuales esta categor \& iacute;a surgi \& oacute;
   por primera vez en el discurso social y pol \& iacute;tico europeo,
   estudian el bagaje hist \& oacute;rico que esta categor \& iacute;a ha
   llevado consigo hasta el siglo XXI e indagan bajo qu \& eacute;
   condiciones el nomadismo ha llegado a ser considerado como un tropo
   prometedor o emancipatorio. De acuerdo con el ethos abierto de la
   Sociolog \& iacute;a Pol \& iacute;tica Internacional, el objetivo de la
   discusi \& oacute;n colectiva no es buscar el dominio conceptual sobre
   la categor \& iacute;a de n \& oacute;mada, sino poner en primer plano
   las formas, m \& uacute;ltiples, ambivalentes y a menudo
   contradictorias, en que esta categor \& iacute;a se ha desplegado a trav
   \& eacute;s del espacio y el tiempo. En t \& eacute;rminos m \& aacute;s
   generales, esta discusi \& oacute;n colectiva es una invitaci \&
   oacute;n para que los acad \& eacute;micos estudien la vida social y pol
   \& iacute;tica internacional de nuestros conceptos de una manera que
   desestabilice las fronteras disciplinarias e institucionales.},

Abstract = {How should rapid developments in digital and cyber technology shape our
   understanding of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P)? And in
   operationalising the doctrine, how might insights on the impact of
   technology be integrated within key tools of R2P implementation, such as
   the United Nations Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes? Although
   prior literature has produced rich discussion of R2P as a norm, and of
   the politics surrounding it, analysts have paid `far less attention to
   what R2P looks like in practice, especially with regard to advances in
   new technology. In this article we contend that, whether we look at the
   future of R2P through a normative/legal lens, or from a
   policy/operational perspective, grappling with the impact of technology
   on the practical realities of mass atrocity situations is of critical
   importance. To explore this argument, we empirically engage with one of
   the primary tools through which the implementation of R2P has benefited,
   the UN Framework of Analysis on Atrocity Crimes (uNFAAC).},

Title = {Transnational Human Rights Violations: Addressing the Evolution of
   Globalized Repression through National Human Rights Institutions},

Abstract = {Transnational Human Rights Violations (THRV) are infringements of
   individual rights that originate outside the jurisdiction in which they
   take effect. Ranging from violent and criminal forms of transnational
   repression through to coercion against targets' family members abroad,
   digital surveillance, and legal intimidation, THRVs today generate
   widespread and systemic constraints on the exercise of human rights in
   jurisdictions around the world. At present, however, targets of THRVs
   typically find few avenues through which to raise complaints, receive
   assistance or pursue redress. This article proposes a new domestic
   institutional mechanism to directly address this situation. It first
   examines the mutually reinforcing, additive effects of transnational
   surveillance, coercion and censorship in the digital era. Next, it
   identifies relevant human rights standards showing state
   responsibilities to monitor and counter THRVs within their jurisdiction,
   and the growing recognition of additive, systemic effects of THRVs on
   broad populations. The third section examines policy responses in the
   United States, Australia, United Kingdom, and international
   organizations, noting that none has adequately addressed the
   contemporary nature and scope of THRVs as international standards
   require. The final section argues that to meet their obligations, states
   should establish Transnational Rights Protection Offices (TRPOs) to
   provide a clear contact point for targets to raise complaints and
   receive support; monitor and report on the situation of THRVs taking
   effect within the state's jurisdiction; advise and inform government
   departments on THRV issues; and develop evidence-based policy
   recommendations. We conclude by laying out the rationale for its
   institutional status within National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs).},

Abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of citizenship rent to help explain
   the apparently contradictory coexistence of liberalising economic
   reforms and the entrenchment of patriarchal values. Citizenship rent
   (CR) is defined as the financial flows that move from the state to the
   citizen in the form of entitlements, employment, and access to
   state-subsidised goods, labour and business opportunities. Our
   innovative proposal substitutes transaction cost economics' assumption
   of market selection for a selection by patriarchy to show how gender
   plays a central role in the reproduction of the asset specificities that
   increase transaction costs. This illustrates how an extractive,
   asset-based economy, like Kuwait's, can afford to double down on
   conservative social values, even at a considerable fiscal price, as long
   as the transaction costs of getting oil to the international markets are
   not increased through social disruption or political uncertainty. Rather
   than examining how women's social reproductive work subsidises social
   and political stability, CR reveals women's role in sustaining assets
   valuable to the state. This paper demonstrates that a close examination
   of the social values that inhibit transactions can also reveal
   patriarchal structures in rentier capital and exhibit a need to further
   analyse the patriarchal transaction costs that shape and sustain
   societies.},

Abstract = {Does the Putin regime have an ideology? This question has attracted
   renewed attention since Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Some
   scholars claim that the war is directly linked to the Putin regime's
   ideological aspirations to restore Russia's greatness and challenge the
   West internationally, while others argue that contemporary regimes in
   the ``Putinist mold{''} have limited need for ideology and use wars
   instrumentally for survival purposes rather than messianic aspirations.
   In this paper we will, first, review arguments pro and contra ideology
   under the Putin regime and identify existing gaps in such literature:
   definitional ambiguity, conflation of concepts of totalitarianism and
   ideology, overfocusing on ideal types of ideology, and so forth. Second,
   we will offer operationalizable metrics against which the ideology is
   measured: coherence of ideological repertoire, temporal consistency,
   elite commitment, codification, indoctrination, internalization, and
   futuristic vision. This paper finds that the current Putin regime checks
   most of the ideological boxes (even if it has not necessarily always
   been the case historically). Lastly, we will conclude by discussing the
   implications of our findings to the analysis of contemporary
   autocracies.},

Abstract = {Throughout the twentieth century, colonies emerged from the so-called
   tutelage of European imperial powers to represent themselves as
   sovereign states. One consequence of this change was an expansion in
   overseas diplomatic training, aimed at inducting into international life
   the hundreds of diplomats required to staff new foreign services. This
   paper interrogates the pedagogical and (geo)political practice of
   tutelage-where guardianship and instruction are held in tension-in order
   to shine a critical spotlight on programs training African diplomats,
   hosted in Britain, France, and Switzerland, and later in Cameroon and
   Kenya. In exploring practices of tutelage both within the classroom and
   at the international scale, we bring to the fore hitherto overlooked
   relational and temporal dimensions of tutelage that provide new insights
   into enduring paternalistic power relations as well as possibilities for
   agency and resistance. We trace the legacies of colonialism within these
   training programs but are also attentive to the ways trainers
   problematized the generalizability of their knowledge and pedagogy, and
   how African diplomats-in-training resisted relations of tutelage. In
   dialogue with scholarship on socialization and international education,
   we develop an enhanced conceptualization of tutelage that provides
   analytical purchase on inter-scalar relationships in world politics
   during and beyond formal decolonization.
   Tout au long du XXe si \& egrave;cle, les colonies ont \& eacute;merg \&
   eacute; de la soi-disant tutelle des puissances imp \& eacute;riales
   europ \& eacute;ennes pour se pr \& eacute;senter comme des \&
   Eacute;tats souverains. L'une des cons \& eacute;quences de ce
   changement a \& eacute;t \& eacute; l'expansion de la formation
   diplomatique \& agrave; l'\& eacute;tranger, qui vise \& agrave; int \&
   eacute;grer dans la vie internationale les centaines de diplomates n \&
   eacute;cessaires \& agrave; l'administration des nouveaux services \&
   eacute;trangers. Cet article interroge la pratique p \& eacute;dagogique
   et (g \& eacute;o)politique de la tutelle (en confrontant la tutelle et
   l'instruction) afin de porter un regard critique sur les programmes de
   formation des diplomates africains, accueillis en Grande-Bretagne, en
   France et en Suisse, et plus tard au Cameroun et au Kenya. En \&
   eacute;tudiant les pratiques de tutelle \& agrave; la fois dans les
   salles de classe et \& agrave; l'\& eacute;chelle internationale, nous
   mettons en \& eacute;vidence les dimensions relationnelles et
   temporelles de la tutelle qui ont \& eacute;t \& eacute; n \&
   eacute;glig \& eacute;es jusqu'\& agrave; pr \& eacute;sent. Ces derni
   \& egrave;res refl \& egrave;tent un nouvel aspect des relations de
   pouvoir paternalistes durables ainsi que des possibilit \& eacute;s
   d'action et de r \& eacute;sistance. Nous retra \& ccedil;ons les h \&
   eacute;ritages du colonialisme dans les programmes de formation
   africains, mais nous pr \& ecirc;tons \& eacute;galement attention \&
   agrave; la fa \& ccedil;on dont les formateurs ont probl \& eacute;matis
   \& eacute; la g \& eacute;n \& eacute;ralisation de leurs connaissances
   et de leur p \& eacute;dagogie, ainsi qu'\& agrave; la fa \& ccedil;on
   dont les diplomates africains en formation ont r \& eacute;sist \&
   eacute; aux relations de tutelle. En dialogue avec les \& eacute;tudes
   sur la socialisation et l'\& eacute;ducation internationale, nous d \&
   eacute;veloppons une conceptualisation am \& eacute;lior \& eacute;e de
   la tutelle. Cette derni \& egrave;re offre un outil analytique sur les
   relations interscalaires dans la politique mondiale pendant et apr \&
   egrave;s la d \& eacute;colonisation formelle.
   A lo largo del siglo XX, las colonias fueron saliendo de lo que llamamos
   tutela de las potencias imperiales europeas, para presentarse a s \&
   iacute; mismas como Estados soberanos. Una de las consecuencias que tuvo
   este cambio fue la expansi \& oacute;n de la formaci \& oacute;n a nivel
   diplom \& aacute;tico en el extranjero, la cual ten \& iacute;a el prop
   \& oacute;sito de incorporar a la vida internacional a los cientos de
   diplom \& aacute;ticos que eran necesarios para poder dotar de personal
   a los nuevos servicios en el extranjero. Este art \& iacute;culo
   cuestiona la pr \& aacute;ctica pedag \& oacute;gica y (geo)pol \&
   iacute;tica de la tutela, en la cual la tutela y la instrucci \&
   oacute;n se mantienen en tensi \& oacute;n entre ellas, con el fin de
   ofrecer una mirada cr \& iacute;tica sobre los programas de formaci \&
   oacute;n de diplom \& aacute;ticos africanos en Gran Breta \& ntilde;a,
   Francia y Suiza, y m \& aacute;s tarde en Camer \& uacute;n y Kenia.
   Estudiamos las pr \& aacute;cticas de tutela, tanto dentro del aula como
   a escala internacional, y, en consecuencia, ponemos el foco en algunas
   dimensiones relacionales y temporales de la tutela, que hasta ahora se
   hab \& iacute;an pasado por alto, y las cuales proporcionan nuevas
   perspectivas en materia de las relaciones de poder paternalistas
   duraderas, as \& iacute; como en lo referente a las posibilidades de
   agencia y resistencia. Observamos los legados del colonialismo
   existentes dentro de estos programas de formaci \& oacute;n, pero tambi
   \& eacute;n prestamos atenci \& oacute;n a las formas que usaron los
   formadores para problematizar la generalizaci \& oacute;n de sus
   conocimientos y su pedagog \& iacute;a, y a c \& oacute;mo los diplom \&
   aacute;ticos africanos que estaban en formaci \& oacute;n se resistieron
   a las relaciones de tutela. Desarrollamos, teniendo en cuenta los
   estudios en materia de socializaci \& oacute;n y educaci \& oacute;n
   internacional, una conceptualizaci \& oacute;n mejorada de la tutela, la
   cual proporciona una comprensi \& oacute;n anal \& iacute;tica de las
   relaciones interescalares en la pol \& iacute;tica mundial, tanto
   durante como despu \& eacute;s de la descolonizaci \& oacute;n formal.},

Abstract = {The United States is in a time of reckoning with whiteness. Despite
   white people benefiting from a disproportionate amount of power at every
   level of government, a significant racial wealth gap, preferential
   treatment in the legal system, and a rise in white supremacy,
   ``colorblind{''} critics continue to argue against the relevance of race
   in a purportedly post-racial society. We assert that parents'
   ethnic-racial socialization (ERS) of their children shapes how children
   view their racial identity and thus influence important political
   attitudes. ERS is a process by which individuals are taught values,
   beliefs, and attitudes about ethnicity and race. Most existing research
   among families of color suggests ERS is strongly linked to a variety of
   adult political attitudes. However, less is known about the impact of
   ERS on political attitudes for white young adults. Drawing on survey
   data from a national U.S. sample of 944 white, young adults (18-25 years
   old), we find that white ERS is linked with political attitudes.
   Specifically, we find that increased cultural socialization, preparation
   for bias, and egalitarianism are positively related to politically
   conservative ideology, while anti-racism is positively related to
   politically liberal ideology. Preparation for bias and egalitarianism
   are positively related to Republican party identification. Promotion of
   mistrust, silent racial socialization, and anti-racism are positively
   related to Democratic party affiliation. We suggest ERS impacts the way
   a person conceptualizes ethnicity and race and is inextricably linked to
   political outcomes.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the fall of the Daesh Islamic State ``Caliphate{''} in
   2019, the international community has been faced with the fact that
   thousands of displaced persons are stranded in Iraqi and Syrian
   detention centers. This article interrogates the governmental policies
   of ten Western European countries toward their nationals and legal
   residents held in the prisons and camps. We analyze the discourse and
   the practices of deterritorialization and reterritorialization of the
   ``foreign-terrorist-fighter-citizens.{''} We find that the Western
   European governments have engaged in different types of
   deterritorialization and reterritorialization moves which have acted to
   position their foreign fighter nationals and dependents at the liminars
   of the body politic in a way that runs the risk of perpetuating the
   foreign fighters' and their dependents' confinement in, what some
   practitioners have denounced as, ``Europe's Guantanamo.{''} We also
   argue that the deterritorialization and reterritorialization moves
   reveal the emptiness of the current-day liberal state project at its
   core. The discourses and practices place the liberal democratic state at
   odds with its own declared values and with the basic human rights of the
   foreign-terrorist-fighter-citizen in a manner that is corrosive to other
   citizens and to the ideals inherent to ``good life{''} of the political
   community.
   \& Agrave; l'aube de la chute du << califat >> de l'\& Eacute;tat
   islamique Daesh en 2019, la communaut \& eacute; internationale s'est
   retrouv \& eacute;e confront \& eacute;e aux milliers de personnes d \&
   eacute;plac \& eacute;es et coinc \& eacute;es dans les centres de d \&
   eacute;tention iraqiens et syriens. Cet article examine les politiques
   gouvernementales de dix pays europ \& eacute;ens occidentaux \& agrave;
   l'\& eacute;gard de leurs r \& eacute;sidents nationaux ou l \&
   eacute;gaux d \& eacute;tenus dans des prisons ou des camps. Nous
   analysons le discours et les pratiques de d \& eacute;territorialisation
   et de reterritorialisation des << citoyens-combattants-terroristes-\&
   eacute;trangers >>. Nous remarquons que les gouvernements d'Europe
   occidentale ont jou \& eacute; diff \& eacute;rents types de coups de d
   \& eacute;territorialisation et reterritorialisation. Ils ont ainsi plac
   \& eacute; leurs ressortissants nationaux se battant \& agrave; l'\&
   eacute;tranger et leurs personnes \& agrave; charge aux limites du corps
   politique, et ont donc risqu \& eacute; de perp \& eacute;tuer la d \&
   eacute;tention des combattants \& eacute;trangers et de leurs personnes
   \& agrave; charge dans le << Guantanamo d'Europe >>, comme certains
   professionnels ont pu l'appeler. Nous affirmons par ailleurs que les
   coups de d \& eacute;territorialisation et de reterritorialisation d \&
   eacute;voilent le manque de substance fondamentale du projet \&
   eacute;tatique lib \& eacute;ral d'aujourd'hui. Les discours et
   pratiques de l'\& Eacute;tat d \& eacute;mocratique lib \& eacute;ral ne
   correspondent pas aux valeurs qu'il d \& eacute;clare d \& eacute;fendre
   et aux droits de l'homme \& eacute;l \& eacute;mentaires des citoyens
   combattants-terroristes-\& eacute;trangers. Cet \& eacute;tat de fait
   nuit aux autres citoyens et aux id \& eacute;aux inh \& eacute;rents au
   << bien vivre >> dans la communaut \& eacute; politique.
   A ra \& iacute;z de la ca \& iacute;da del ``califato{''} del Estado Isl
   \& aacute;mico de Daesh en 2019, la comunidad internacional ha tenido
   que enfrentarse al hecho de que miles de personas desplazadas est \&
   eacute;n retenidas en centros de detenci \& oacute;n iraqu \& iacute;es
   y sirios. Este art \& iacute;culo explora las pol \& iacute;ticas
   gubernamentales de diez pa \& iacute;ses de Europa occidental hacia sus
   ciudadanos y residentes legales, que son recluidos en prisiones y
   campos. Analizamos el discurso y las pr \& aacute;cticas de
   desterritorializaci \& oacute;n y reterritorializaci \& oacute;n hacia
   los ``ciudadanos combatientes terroristas extranjeros.{''} Concluimos
   que los gobiernos de Europa occidental se han involucrado en diferentes
   tipos de movimientos de desterritorializaci \& oacute;n y
   reterritorializaci \& oacute;n, los cuales han actuado para posicionar a
   sus ciudadanos combatientes extranjeros y dependientes en los liminares
   del cuerpo pol \& iacute;tico, en una manera que corre el riesgo de
   perpetuar el confinamiento de estos combatientes extranjeros y sus
   dependientes en, lo que algunos expertos han denunciado como: << El
   Guantanamo europeo >> Tambi \& eacute;n argumentamos que los movimientos
   de desterritorializaci \& oacute;n y de reterritorializaci \& oacute;n
   revelan la vacuidad en su n \& uacute;cleo del proyecto de Estado
   liberal actual. Los discursos y las pr \& aacute;cticas del estado
   democr \& aacute;tico liberal le colocan en desacuerdo con sus propios
   valores declarados, y con los derechos humanos b \& aacute;sicos del
   ciudadano combatiente terrorista extranjero, en una manera que resulta
   corrosiva para otros ciudadanos y para los ideales inherentes a la
   ``buena vida{''}de la comunidad pol \& iacute;tica.},

Abstract = {This article reports findings of a Q Methodology study in which we
   explored the opinions of employees from eight Dutch regulatory agencies
   on how agencies gain their reputation. This is the largest study to date
   examining employee's views on the relative importance of different
   factors in reputation acquisition by public organizations, and the first
   analyzing employees in regulatory agencies. Results reveal five distinct
   ``profiles{''} of opinion among employees about the factors most
   important in reputation acquisition. Regression analysis, further,
   supports that different regulatory agencies are dominated by employees
   with different opinions on how reputation is formed. These findings
   contribute to the growing empirical literature on how regulatory
   agencies, and their various employees, understand and approach
   reputation management.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of methodological choices and
   collaborative processes in a complex study that delved into the intimate
   experiences of violence as narrated by conscripts to the Peruvian armed
   forces. Lurgio Gavil \& aacute;n is a Peruvian anthropologist who
   strongly identifies with the interviewed veterans because of his own
   experiences, and Jelke Boesten is European feminist scholar with
   specific ideas about gender justice. Our collaboration allows us to
   raise fundamental questions around the limitations, validity, and ethics
   of knowledge production. The ``debris{''} of this collaboration refers
   to the ethical questions that we may have previously failed to raise and
   address. Why did each of us embark on this research? Have our respective
   epistemological positions shifted due to the research? How has the
   nature of the collaboration, and our different positions of power
   therein, enlightened or concerned us? With what are we left, and what do
   we leave behind?},

Abstract = {This article explores the political agency of victims and proposes a new
   concept for understanding complex political victims in violent political
   contexts. To do so, it first challenges the problematic dichotomy of
   victim-perpetrator identities in transitional justice, drawing on
   interdisciplinary studies of agency, victim mobilization and the
   phenomenon of enforced disappearance. I (re)conceptualize victims'
   agency by applying the concept of `relational autonomy' which considers
   the role of social relations in the agency-building process and
   highlights relational values that are under-appreciated in the liberal
   concept of agency. I examine the case of the Saturday Mothers, a victim
   movement in Turkey, to show how their agency has been re-established
   through their interaction within this social network, and how this
   shapes the sense of justice they imagine and practice in this social
   space.},

Abstract = {This article conceptualizes and operationalizes the right to protection
   and assistance to the family (Article 10 of the International Covenant
   on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) in relation to child protection
   services in England and the removal of children from birth families that
   are deemed to pose a risk to them. It identifies the differences between
   the social right to protection and assistance to the family and the more
   commonly known civil right to private and family life. The article
   merges doctrinal analysis of international human rights law with a
   peer-led methodology of socio-legal research reliant on issue
   prioritization and observations from social workers, families in
   poverty-primarily mothers-and young people who have experience of the
   care system. The process aims to respect all different forms of
   knowledge and to challenge the epistemic injustices that result from the
   systematic silencing of people in poverty. Besides this epistemic value,
   lived experience can illuminate the academic and practitioner
   understanding of the main problems facing people in poverty. In
   particular, in relation to the right to protection and assistance to the
   family, lived experience can shed light on the human impact of prejudice
   and the lack of adequate material support.},

Abstract = {This article uses the U.S. bicentennial as a case study to develop two
   themes about U.S.-British relations in the 1970s. First, the
   performative framework of commemoration was of considerable importance
   to the ``special relationship.{''} The U.S. and British governments
   effectively used the bicentennial of an Anglo-American war to enact and
   popularize a distinctly useful historical narrative-a story of bilateral
   unity and strength, shared culture, eternal peace, and friendship-that
   was useful during the Cold War. Commemoration of the bicentennial
   signaled British recognition that historical and cultural ties offered a
   robust source of influence in Washington. Second, as the zenith of
   Anglo-American cooperation during World War II faded in collective
   memory, the political salience of commemorative events increased during
   the Cold War. They became contributory to and constitutive of a
   continually renewing public narrative of ``special{''} Anglo-American
   relations that interwove times past, present, and future.},

Abstract = {Objectives: The main objectives of this article are to examine the
   context in which the 2013 local reform took place and to analyze the key
   actors involved in it. Methodology: To achieve this, a research
   methodology will be employed, consisting of an exhaustive analysis of
   the documentation produced between 2012 and 2013. Direct observation by
   the article's author of the reform process is also used, along with
   subsequent evaluation of the impact of the law. Results: The results
   reveal the varying influence of the involved actors and how the final
   text reflects the balance among some of them. Conclusions: Noteworthy
   conclusions include that the National Institute of Public Administration
   (INAP) aligned the reform with financial sustainability and budgetary
   stability principles. The Institute of Fiscal Studies (IEF) emphasized
   the significance of population size in the efficiency of municipal
   services. The Technical General Secretariat of the Ministry of Finance
   strengthened state financial control. The Spanish Federation of
   Municipalities and Provinces (FEMP) did not achieve its main objectives,
   whereas the collective of national-qualified professionals only managed
   to return to the situation prior to 2007. Furthermore, autonomous
   communities exercised a veto on certain essential aspects of the reform.
   Constitutional Court judgments partially affected the reorganization of
   municipal competences. Finally, political parties were found to have a
   variable impact on the final text.},

Abstract = {This provincial case study demonstrates the diversity of political
   movements mobilised by environmental anxieties, particularly outside of
   Moscow, in the final years of Soviet Russia. By focusing on the
   emergence of green politics that promoted ecosocialism, the analysis
   takes up the call proposed by scholars of the Anthropocene by exploring
   late Soviet Russia as a place of political possibilities, where
   environmentalism-as-politics became a force for change. The failure of
   the green movement after 1990, in light of their successes before the
   dissolution of the USSR, offers new insights into the effectiveness of
   green politics in the Russian provinces prior to the disintegration of
   the USSR.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the enduring impact of colonial violence in
   responses to modern conflict by transitional justice mechanisms. It
   presents an example of how societies continue to be structured by racial
   and colonial injustice and how this influences contemporary transitional
   justice. This is done through an analysis of the popular memory of the
   Mau Mau insurgency from 1952 to 1960 in Kenya, the trial of the six
   Kenyan nationalists known as the `Kapenguria Six' by the British
   colonial administration and the trials of six Kenyans alleged to be most
   responsible for orchestrating the 2007-2008 post-election violence in
   Kenya, known as the `Ocampo Six' before the International Criminal Court
   (ICC). In the Kenyan context, the influence of memories of colonial
   violence enabled the promotion of political agendas and arguably
   coloured public debate surrounding the two Kenya cases before the ICC.
   Transitional justice mechanisms such as the ICC do not operate in an
   ahistorical vacuum and international criminal trials as a form of
   transitional justice may be contested where there is no genuine
   accountability, redress or reparations for victims of colonial crimes.
   However, the juxtaposition of colonial crimes and the ICC prosecutions
   in Kenya also raises important questions relating to accountability for
   historical crimes in former colonies, the temporal limitations of
   transitional justice mechanisms and their unequal application.},

Abstract = {This article provides a comparative analysis of how courts have
   performed judicial review on supermajority rules governing courts'
   decision-making. Through an empirical approach, covering the cases of
   the United States, Peru and Poland, the article argues that the
   supermajority's legal source and the chronology of its establishment may
   influence the court's ability to review such rules and the case's
   outcome. Finally, the article addresses the paradox of whether courts
   must apply the very provision they are tasked to review.},

Abstract = {This chapter analyses the impact which Russia's war in Ukraine, as the
   manifestation of illiberal politics in Russia, has had on migration. We
   outline key developments in Russia's security policy and the shift
   towards ideological and disruptive illiberalism rooted in Soviet and
   imperial traditions and examine the war's impact on mobilities within
   and from Central Asia, specifically looking at what these changing
   dynamics mean for illiberalism and authoritarian rule in the region. The
   analysis points to the fact that Russian illiberalism has formed a loose
   state ideology, resulting in a balancing act between political and
   economic goals in the Global East and Global South and utilizing forced
   migration and refugees as a hybrid tool to influence the outcome of the
   war. Ultimately, the way in which migration is addressed in the region
   is likely to have significant implications for the future of
   illiberalism.},

Abstract = {Since the 2000s, the border between Greece and North Macedonia has
   undergone a progressive Europeanisation as an external border of the
   European Union. By looking at the regulations governing border control
   and the evolution of individual cross-border practices in regard of the
   local context in borderlands that long shared a common path, this paper
   questions the way in which the implementation of a new normative order
   reshuffles the configuration between social orders inherited from
   distinct historical periods and impact contemporary b/ordering
   processes.},

Abstract = {In this chapter, the authors briefly outline the emergence of
   world-systems approaches first formulated by Immanuel Wallerstein and
   expanded by Janet Abu-Lughod. They discuss the emergence of
   connectivities as well as hierarchies over the centuries in global
   perspective. Conquest and colonization increased inequalities between
   peoples in macro-regions and long-distance trade often turned into
   plunder. The racialization of labour forces beginning with slavery
   involved an ideology of skin colour-coding that underpinned the
   politico-economic power of European-Atlantic and, subsequently, North
   Atlantic states. Skin-colour hierarchies have also been developed in
   other segments of the world. In this frame, migrants, despite being
   integral and irreplaceable parts of global labour markets, are often
   excluded from social and political rights in the societies to which they
   contribute their labour. The authors rely on World Bank data to discuss
   global migrations due to global inequalities.},

   {[}Anonymous], 38 The co-deployment of multiple critical terms with variegated genealogies in this paragraph builds upon the theoretical apparatus that underlies and motivates this dissertation. My use of ``hail{''} is rooted primarily in Louis Althusser's formulation of ``interpellation{''} as the moment one recognizes oneself as a product of ideology in On the Reproduction of Capitalism: Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (London; New York: Verso, 2014), 190-196. However, unlike Althusser, who framed power as a negative operation performed upon the subject by agents of ``ISAs,{''} rather than both a negative and positive operation that produced new sorts of subjects, my usage of ``hail{''} is also more simply meant to denote an act of recognition by an actor in a particular mode of address or object (such as a diagram). Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe name the act of intentionally calling out to others in the mode that ONC does in its vision papers and calls for public comment an ``articulation.{''} See, Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics, 2nd ed (London; New York: Verso, 2001). When one recognizes themselves in a specific mode of address they are hailed - and acts of hailing impart ideologies, create subjects, bring out new constituencies, create new publics, form new polities, enact new stakeholders, and assist in materializing new realities. This is as true in health IT policy as in any other field of activity. This approach is also informed by Michael Warner's work, particularly in the opening pages of Publics and Counterpublics, where he writes that ``Publics...have become an almost natural feature of the social landscape, like pavement...Your attention is everywhere solicited by artifacts that say, before they say anything else, Hello, public!{''} (New York, NY: Zone Books, 2002), 7. This is the sort of hailing that ONC's diagram is doing, to an in-principle-limitless range of actors, whom the office (and I) call ``stakeholders.{''} My use of ``materialize{''} drawn chiefly from Michelle Murphy, who writes in Sick Building Syndrome and the Problem of Uncertainty, on the materialization of physical objects and objects of knowledge, that It is not so easy to materialize a new object...At stake in writing a history of the contested reality of chemical exposures is the historicity of what counts as real, of what did and did not matter. To do this, I have conveyed matter, not in terms of a prior thingness but rather in terms of the processes of history, concrete social and technical arrangements and the effects of power - hence my use of the verb materialize. (15) ONC's diagram works to materialize new knowledge-objects in the way that Murphy describes: tracing the ``concrete social and technical arrangements of power{''} so that actors can imagine new ones in a transformed health IT ecosystem. My definition of ``reality{''} comes from an assemblage of actor-network theorists such as Murphy, Annemarie Mol, Bruno Latour, and John Law. However, I am chiefly informed by John Law's approach in essays such as After Method, ``Notes on the Theory of the Actor-Network: Ordering, Strategy, and Heterogeneity,{''} and ``Seeing Like a Survey.{''} Reality is simply what actors, working together in networks, bring about and sustain: it is what they enact and materialize. See also, Boellstorff, ``For Whom the Ontology Turns.{''} As Law notes in After Method, these realities are vaguely constituted, are constantly changing and in flux. When technologies are involved, they need recalibration or what Andrew Pickering calls ``'tuning' in the sense of tuning a radio set or car engine...No one knows in advance the shape of future machines and what they will do, but we can track the process of establishing that shape,{''} by following the actions of both human and non-human actors in the network. See, John Law, ``Notes on the Theory of the Actor-Network: Ordering, Strategy, and Heterogeneity,{''} Systems Practice 5, no. 4 (April 10, 1992): 379-93; John Law, ``Seeing Like a Survey,{''} Cultural Sociology 3, no. 2 (July 1, 2009): 239-56; Andrew Pickering, The Mangle of Practice: Time, Agency, and Science (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1995),14-15. ONC's ecosystem envisions chaotic realities like these, that require constant tweaking, tuning, and tinkering: both in policy and local environments where technologies are used. Describing messy realities requires messy - if also exacting - theorization: theory that, along with the realities toward which it is aimed, also produces new realities..

Number = {1, SI},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic era witnessed an intense competition for
   knowledge, which was essentially a contest over whose knowledge becomes
   authoritative. In this article, we focus on the role of expert networks
   in contesting the official pandemic policy. We study specifically an
   expert network in Finland, consisting of researchers from different
   disciplines ranging from law to economics and medicine. What makes the
   case so intriguing is that the network's communicating style was
   affectively charged and alarmist, setting it apart from traditional
   expert language that is articulated in a style that aims towards
   neutrality and objectivity. Similar networks were formed across the
   world under the loose umbrella term `Zero Covid' during the intensive
   pandemic years 2020 to 2022. Our aim is to increase knowledge on the
   role of such spontaneous networks during a health crisis that is
   characterised by epistemic instability. The pandemic era was
   particularly conducive to the formation of such networks, but they have
   been less active in the recovery phase. We argue that these networks
   were energised by the epistemic void in the intensive phase of the
   pandemic but lost their impetus in the recovery phase, which has been
   characterised by more robust knowledge and a less acute sense of threat.
   We employ frame analysis to identify two dominant frames-the national
   battle frame and the urgency frame-that the Finnish network used in
   public communication. We also briefly review its public reception to
   illustrate how the network managed to generate authority in the pandemic
   era. Finally, we discuss the tricky nature of policy advice by
   scientists who are urged to step into the political sphere to offer
   their advice to politicians but, as a result, can be labelled as
   political actors rather than as scientific experts.},

Abstract = {The literature on Russia's conservative turn focuses on the state
   program to embed conservative values in a top-down process of narrative
   construction that links shared history, lived experiences, and events.
   Relying on the unique LegitRuss survey evidence collected in 2021, we
   complement this research by exploring how values-based cleavages
   structure Russian society, bind distinct social groups, and reflect
   congruence between the Kremlin's conservative messaging and popular
   political attitudes. The results show that values do define groups in
   society and that conservatives constitute a majority in Russian society.
   Yet, state conservatives are internally divided around a spectrum of
   conservative beliefs, and only one-third adhere to the Kremlin's ideal
   conservative type. While this core is an important tool for Kremlin
   efforts to control society, project support, and manufacture electoral
   majorities, it reflects the limits authoritarians face when they try to
   impose a unitary set of national values.},

   twenty-five years ago. It argues that PoC has evolved significantly,
   expanding from a narrow focus on physical protection from immediate
   threats to a holistic approach that includes establishing a protective
   environment. It suggests that while the PoC mandate has proven effective
   in reducing violence, the future is fraught with four significant
   challenges: waning state commitment to UN peacekeeping, the
   fragmentation of global peace and security mechanisms, shifting local
   perceptions in a rapidly changing information landscape, and mounting
   disillusionment among UN personnel. This essay contends that these
   obstacles underscore the inherently political nature of PoC, where power
   dynamics and perceptions profoundly impact mission success. As
   peacekeeping missions scale back, PoC remains essential but increasingly
   precarious, demanding strategic adaptability and sustained commitment.
   Ultimately, the essay argues that without renewed political and
   institutional dedication, PoC's effectiveness-and the UN's
   credibility-will be difficult to uphold in the face of evolving conflict
   dynamics and geopolitical shifts.},

Abstract = {Expectations are high regarding the impact of the extensive Covid-19
   crisis support `Next Generation EU'. Mixed experiences from established
   EU distributive policies indicate, though, that ultimate policy outcomes
   largely depend on national implementation decisions. This article
   scrutinises vote-buying strategies according to which domestic
   governments exploit the largely autonomous national distribution of EU
   funds to target certain constituencies. To study national strategies,
   the analysis takes advantage of the extraordinary leeway given to
   domestic governments in distributing REACT-EU funds, part of Next
   Generation EU. The encompassing quantitative analysis covers a large
   sample of member states and committed funds. The regression results
   provide no support that national governments distribute REACT-EU funds
   to politically opportune regions. In a departure from most previous
   analyses focusing on specific member states, these findings suggest that
   vote buying is not the dominant strategy in the national implementation
   of all EU funds.},

Abstract = {Most Americans believe there is too much money in politics and are
   sympathetic to reform. Using nationally representative survey data, we
   study how the public views the likelihood that members of Congress (MCs)
   will support reforms to reduce the influence of the wealthy. The
   public's beliefs about reform may have implications for candidates'
   fundraising strategies. Because women are underrepresented in politics
   and may face campaign finance barriers, the reform debate may have
   unique implications for them: to the extent that women are associated
   with reform, they may face a dilemma with regard to what fundraising
   strategies they can employ. We propose that individuals will draw on
   gender, party, and race/ethnicity in their expectations about which MCs
   are most reform-minded.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing inequalities. However, the
   growing body of work on hegemonic masculinity (HM) has paid insufficient
   attention to its role in and responses to state policies in the context
   of a pandemic. Using a case study of Taiwan - one of the few countries
   in the world to have successfully eradicated domestic outbreaks
   throughout most of the pandemic - I investigate the extent to which HM
   mediated an unrecognized sovereign state's strategy for combating the
   pandemic but also its reinforcement of gendered hierarchies. I argue
   that China's alienation of Taiwan in the international community is a
   form of HM and subsequently led to Taiwan's militarized rhetoric with
   respect to COVID. I also contend that such HM at the international level
   was mirrored at the domestic level through the collective
   conceptualization of which patients were ``legitimate{''} and which
   citizens were loyal. Yet, the domestic social responses to COVID-19 were
   gendered, classed, raced, and aged, further marginalizing those with
   protected characteristics. The study offers implications for how HM
   shapes who belongs as members of society and how citizenship is tied to
   individuals' contributions to collective nationhood.},

Abstract = {This paper advances recent work exploring synergies and tensions between
   two schools of political-economic thought-degrowth and modern monetary
   theory (MMT)-and posits that this synergy warrants closer attention from
   International Political Economy and Environment (IPEE) scholars. Thus
   far, degrowth policies have largely been proposed upon the assumption
   that governments are limited in budgetary terms. MMT theorists have
   offered an alternative perspective on fiscal policy space but generally
   provide insufficient ecological considerations. This paper asks how each
   school's underlying assumptions about the limits of economic activity
   might inform the other's framework of action. We find that while there
   are tensions between the two schools' economic philosophies, there are
   possibilities for cross-fertilization, which ought to interest IPEE
   scholars. MMT could engage degrowth's perspective of ecological limits
   and global socio-ecological justice in its discussions about what
   economies can `afford', whereas degrowth could use MMT insights to shift
   from a `pay for' to a `resource' frame, while centering abundance before
   limits. Meanwhile, IPEE can provide insights to an MMT-informed degrowth
   transition by grounding this debate in material analyses of class and
   power. Our findings suggest that degrowth and MMT could provide a
   normative direction for IPEE research centered around meeting material
   needs within planetary boundaries.},

Abstract = {Student-run asylum clinics within medical schools represent a promising
   alternative to costly medicolegal services for people seeking asylum by
   providing pro bono forensic medical evaluations. However, there exist
   significant operational barriers to creating and developing such
   clinics, which depend largely on volunteerism and limited financial
   budgets. This policy and practice note not only presents a framework
   aimed at navigating these barriers in developing a student-run asylum
   clinic but also outlines critical challenges and recommendations for
   addressing them. We describe three principal components of clinic
   structure: community outreach and service, administration of forensic
   medical evaluations, and continuity of care. We also highlight
   challenges, such as access to a physical space for evaluations,
   maintenance of interpreter access and quality, standardization of
   clinician evaluator expectations, clinician evaluator availability, and
   evaluator wellbeing. Recommendations include the incorporation of a
   diversity of referral sources, opportunities for clinician-clinician
   shadowing, evaluation quality assessment, affidavit standardization, and
   development of interdisciplinary partnership.},

Abstract = {How does context influence individuals' misinformation about socially
   marginalized groups? Scholarship has long found that one's geographical
   and social environment are important determinants for one's political
   attitudes. But how these contexts shape individuals' levels of
   misinformation about stigmatized groups remains an open and pressing
   question, especially given the swift rise of misinformation in recent
   years. Using three original surveys, we find that individuals who report
   more contact with a diverse group of individuals were significantly less
   likely to be misinformed. These findings are particularly pronounced
   among white Americans. Moreover, contrary to the popular belief that
   where one lives is a strong determinant of racial attitudes, we also
   find that partisan and racial context did not meaningfully shape
   misinformation. These findings shed light on the factors that helps us
   to understand the misinformation that exists about this sizable share of
   U.S. society.},

Abstract = {Reducing crime opportunities at places is a successful strategy to
   reduce actual crime. This conceptual article examines how reducing crime
   at places is also an opportunity to have greater social impact and
   improve social justice, particularly when crime displacement may occur,
   through the recognition that no place exists in a vacuum. We discuss
   opportunity reduction in its traditional form, but also in a broader
   context that considers a fuller extent of crime prevention that more
   closely resembles its original formulation in the field of environmental
   criminology. We interrogate our traditional opportunity-reduction
   theories, identifying some of their limitations and noting that
   theoretical integration is not only conceptually possible, but
   empirically shown to matter. This is followed by a discussion of
   theoretical integration and its importance for crime prevention. We
   close our discussion outlining a crime prevention model, SafeGrowth,
   that considers both place-based strategies and community approaches.},

Abstract = {The evidence base on the effectiveness of crime prevention programs and
   policies has grown significantly over the past two decades. But despite
   the attention given to particular kinds of crime reduction
   interventions, advancement of social justice and reduction of racial
   disparities in the administration of criminal justice have been limited.
   Additionally, despite the growing diversity of the U.S. population,
   prevention research that focuses on disparities among racial and ethnic
   groups is limited. In this article, I draw on insights from three
   juvenile court case studies to discuss the strengths and limitations of
   research on youth justice. These cases illustrate how social
   inequalities shape the lives of youth and how juvenile court responses,
   which are ostensible evidence-based treatments, can compound inequality
   and punish some youth. I then present strategies that center racial
   equity and social justice as part of a new framework for youth crime
   prevention.},

Abstract = {Effectiveness is a term often used in intelligence studies. However,
   what effectiveness means in relation to intelligence remains elusive and
   intelligence effectiveness is studied from a wide variety of viewpoints.
   This paper aims to understand the concepts of effectiveness of
   intelligence and seeks to gain greater insight into what drives
   effectiveness. Reviewing 176 studies from 12 journals this paper
   identifies four paradigms of intelligence effectiveness - utility,
   intelligence failure, precision, and rigor- and describes distinct
   perspectives within each paradigm, the constructs used to determine
   effectiveness, and their antecedents. Analysis of the results shows that
   the paradigms of intelligence effectiveness are interrelated. In
   addition, paradigms and their constructs can be sequenced, revealing
   gaps in our knowledge, and providing an agenda for further research.},

Abstract = {Agentic women are frequently stereotyped negatively in politics. While
   public opinion suggests higher levels of egalitarian gender attitudes
   toward women in politics, these analyses miss important variations in
   explicit sexism. Using a survey experiment in the Canadian multi-party
   context, we show that for those reporting high levels of explicit
   sexism, agentic women are, as potential candidates, disadvantaged
   compared to similarly agentic men. Given the uneven distribution of
   sexist attitudes among partisans, these results suggest that gender
   representation differences between parties can be traced both to party
   recruitment strategies and the political behavior of party members.},

Abstract = {By mid-1963, the immediate threat to European security from the
   construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 had receded, but East-West
   tensions over the city remained high. Although some scholars such as
   Marc Trachtenberg have claimed that the Cuban missile crisis of October
   1962 was followed by a lasting East-West detente in Europe, this article
   shows that the status of Berlin remained a Cold War flashpoint until
   well into 1963. The article highlights three of the military showdowns
   (the so-called Autobahn crises) that occurred in October and November
   1963 over the transportation rules for U.S., British, and French access
   to West Berlin. The crises caused a good deal of friction, but their
   resolution ushered in a more peaceful time for Berlin and Europe as a
   whole.},

Abstract = {Worker cooperatives in the gig economy can involve large and
   heterogeneous memberships, which makes them vulnerable to member
   opportunism depleting collective resources. External shocks may present
   another challenge for collective resource management. This raises the
   question of how heterogeneous cooperatives design rules to mitigate
   opportunistic behavior and whether these rules evolve in the face of
   external shocks. We study the case of Smart Belgium between 2017 and
   2022, thereby covering the COVID-19 pandemic and new cooperative
   legislation as external shocks. Building on the institutional grammar
   methodology, we analyze 412 rules of Smart. The findings indicate that
   external shocks with sudden resource scarcity do not necessarily
   motivate rule changes (COVID-19) while external shocks without an effect
   on collective resources can motivate rule changes (national policy
   change). The study also shows what kind of rules heterogeneous
   cooperatives may design to mitigate opportunism.},

Abstract = {I argue that treaty withdrawal has two opposing effects on the
   development of international law. First, it directly impacts the treaty
   where it occurs by pushing the remaining members to adopt reforms to
   maintain cooperation. Second, it indirectly affects the development of
   other treaties by damaging diplomatic relations between the withdrawing
   state and other members, hindering negotiations in other areas of
   cooperation. Consequentially, treaty withdrawal has a mixed impact on
   the development of international law: it expedites the reform of one
   treaty while inhibiting reform elsewhere. I test this argument by
   applying a difference-in-differences design to an original panel of
   treaties built from the records of the United Nations. My findings
   reveal that while withdrawal increases the number of reforms in treaties
   where it occurs, it decreases reforms in similar treaties with
   comparable memberships. The indirect effect more than cancels out the
   direct effect. Overall, treaty withdrawal impedes the creation of new
   international laws.},

Abstract = {Elite schisms are known to destabilize autocracies, but there is little
   scholarship that examines how such splits affect regime support or
   perceptions of regime stability. We utilize a unique survey that was in
   the field during a June 2023 coup attempt in Russia to examine this
   question. By comparing the responses of respondents interviewed before
   the coup with those interviewed after the coup, we estimate the effect
   of the coup on a number of attitudes. We find that the coup had no
   effect on regime support and only a limited (negative) effect on
   perceptions of regime stability. By contrast, we find that the coup
   caused a precipitous drop in support for the coup's leader and that this
   effect is larger among those who watch state television. The findings
   suggest that the regime used its control of the information space to
   swiftly demonize the coup leader and avoid public fallout.},

Abstract = {I examine the tension between Donald Trump's perception of the
   judiciary-marked by a form of legal realism-and the Supreme Court's
   stated commitment to judicial bipartisanship and independence. I analyze
   Trump's public criticisms of judicial rulings that counter his personal
   interests and his criticism of his own appointees and other
   Republican-appointed justices who do not always rule in his favor to
   highlight how the court's claim of independence is complicated by
   political science data showing that judges often align with the
   ideological leanings of the party whose president appointed them. This
   analysis ultimately reveals a growing disconnect between the judiciary's
   stated ideals and the political pressures present in an increasingly
   polarized environment.},

Abstract = {The Roberts court's immigration jurisprudence has reinforced the
   discretionary powers of the government and sharply limited
   constitutional constraints on the exercise of those powers. As a result,
   the protection of immigrants' rights increasingly has become a matter of
   executive grace. Discretion plays a crucial role in the execution of
   immigration law, and through its use, the executive can promote
   humanitarian objectives. But even when protective discretionary acts
   receive the imprimatur of courts, they do not provide lasting security
   because they are only as good as the policy preferences of the president
   in power. Indeed, discretion can also perpetuate overly aggressive
   enforcement in pursuit of those preferences. The checks the Roberts
   court has imposed on the operation of the enforcement system tend to
   reflect a skepticism of government, rather than a meaningful regard for
   the rights and interests of immigrants, leaving Congress as the only
   meaningful source of stability for the system and for immigrants
   themselves.},

Abstract = {While the decision to invade all of Ukraine and Russia's atrocious
   behavior and disastrous performance in the war may seem surprising and
   even irrational, Russia has in fact followed patterns that it used in
   the recent past with the two Chechen wars of 1994-1996 and 1999-2009. In
   this article, we compare key similarities and differences in the two
   Russo-Chechen wars and the current war on Ukraine by analyzing three
   aspects of the wars: Russian political strategy in the territories,
   Russian military strategy and conduct, and the Russian state's approach
   to war-related information and media campaigns. By drawing these
   comparisons, we hope to show how Russia's past war strategies in
   Chechnya might shed light on outcomes in Ukraine. In addition, in
   showing the similarities between Russian actions in Chechnya and Ukraine
   we highlight the argument that Russia is treating Ukraine not as a
   sovereign state, but as a part of Russia.},

Abstract = {Ecomaternalism remains the dominant narrative concerning the role of
   families in climate politics. The centrality of ecomaternalist
   narratives to intersectional constructions of race, gender,
   heteronormativity, and nature means that interrogating and disrupting
   these dominant representations of families is a crucial task of
   ecofeminist, postcolonial, and queer political theory. This article
   explores other ways to narrate familial politics that might challenge
   rather than reproduce dominant power relations. Examining three
   Africanfuturist short stories by Nnedi Okorafor ({''}Spider the
   Artist{''}), Tlotlo Tsamaase ({''}Virtual Snapshots{''}), and Terh
   Agbedeh ({''}Mango Republic{''}), set in Nigeria and Botswana, I argue
   that they draw our attention to transformations within cyborg,
   digitized, and utopian families and social structures, as well as the
   potential for violence within the heteronormative patriarchal family.
   They narrate alternative discourses about families in crisis, families
   as threat, and families as ruination that are rarely articulated in
   climate politics. In these stories, the family is not the solution to
   climate politics, but a social relation that will (and should) change as
   the climatic and social context changes.},

Abstract = {After 25 years of successful experience with democracy, Benin entered a
   phase of democratic backsliding after President Patrice Talon came to
   power in 2016. According to multiple measures, Benin's democracy
   declined continuously between 2016 and 2023. This article highlights how
   the complacency and weakness of elites in Benin created an environment
   in which democracy deteriorated. Notably, the influence-or lack of
   influence-of elites resulted in limited competitiveness of the electoral
   process and worsening freedom of expression and assembly. Better
   cooperation of opposition forces in 2023 has helped to halt further
   backsliding, but it has not reversed the decline.},

Abstract = {This study explores whether the European Union's (EU's) response to the
   large-scale refugee displacement from Ukraine in 2022 has led to a more
   equitable sharing of responsibilities amongst member states with regard
   to the Syrian refugee crisis. To do so, responsibility sharing is
   assessed by comparing actual and capacity-based refugee shares for each
   country, drawing the definition of the latter from an improved version
   of the European Commission's distribution key. Our analysis reveals that
   whilst disparities in actual refugee shares between countries are
   somewhat smaller in the current emergency humanitarian situation
   compared with the Syrian crisis, such disparities almost double when
   countries' reception capacities are incorporated as a benchmark. Thus,
   the study reveals a kind of paradox: greater disparities in
   responsibility sharing in a context of high solidarity amongst countries
   for the reception of refugees.},

Abstract = {Decisions the EU took in response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine
   have been assessed in scholarship as `unprecedented' and `unthinkable
   before'. The Union's response to the 2022 full-scale invasion has thus
   been much stronger than the one linked to the annexation of Crimea in
   2014. The difference between the 2014 and 2022 responses can be
   attributed to many factors, particularly differences in the nature and
   scale of Russia's attacks and the US co-ordination efforts during the
   Russian pre-war military mobilization on Ukraine's borders. We show
   that, though these factors undoubtedly matter, it has been the
   path-dependent dynamics of EU-Ukraine co-operation on association
   relations, Ukraine's resilience-building and the EU's socialization with
   Ukraine from the Euromaidan Revolution (2013-14) to the 2022 invasion
   that contributed to the strength and promptness of the EU's response to
   Russia's full-scale invasion.},

Abstract = {What effect does populism have on public attitudes toward International
   Organizations (IOs)? In this article, we differentiate for the first
   time between populist communication - understood as IO criticism in line
   with populist core ideas - and populist voting as political behavior
   among citizens. We argue, first, that populist voters - that is,
   citizens voting for a populist party - are more critical of IOs. Second,
   IO-critical communication based on the democratic deficit of global
   governance and the loss of national sovereignty that populist parties
   often adopt have a substantially damaging impact on public IO attitudes.
   Third, we propose that the negative effect of IO-critical communication
   should be stronger among populist voters, and, fourth, considerably vary
   among groups of different educational levels. To test our theoretical
   expectations, we first turn to World Values Survey data (7th wave) and
   demonstrate that populist voters are significantly more skeptical of IOs
   than non-populist voters, while the effect of populist voting is
   strongest for more educated citizens. Second, we use a preregistered
   survey experiment to explore the effect of IO-critical communication on
   IO favorability and determine if populist voting and educational levels
   moderate these communication effects. Our findings reveal that
   IO-critical communication substantially decreases confidence in IOs.
   Populist and non-populist voters do not differ in their susceptibility,
   yet IO-critical communication exerts its greatest effects among the
   higher educated.},

Abstract = {The creator of James Bond, Ian Fleming, served as Assistant to the
   Director of Naval Intelligence throughout World War II and played a
   leading role in many of its key operations. Yet despite Fleming's
   grounding and experience in actual wartime intelligence operations and
   organisations, the origin of the Bond novels in real wartime
   intelligence has been neglected. Instead, the adventures of James Bond
   have more often been read as escapist fantasies concocted by Fleming for
   fame, profit, and imperial propaganda. This article will respond to this
   neglect of Fleming's realism by tracing numerous parallels between
   wartime intelligence operations, agents, and institutions - such as
   Operation MINCEMEAT, Operation RUTHLESS, 30 Assault Unit, and Camp X -
   and the plots and personnel of Bond novels including Casino Royale, Live
   and Let Die, Moonraker, From Russia, with Love, and On Her Majesty's
   Secret Service. The article will further explore how Fleming artfully
   evaded the constraints of Official Secrecy by disguising classified
   intelligence material as `romanticized caricatures' in his postwar spy
   fiction. The profound impact of Fleming's personal wartime trauma on the
   Bond novels will also be examined to ground the stories more firmly in
   actual wartime experience and intelligence.},

Abstract = {The scholarship on the nineteenth-century coolie trade has shown that
   the study of post-emancipation labour regimes can yield valuable
   insights into understanding the continuous impact of global labour
   circulations. In particular, indenture helps to elucidate the transition
   from slavery to wage labour and the creation of racial hierarchies in
   colonized territories. Building on the scholarship on bonded labour
   regimes, this chapter traces the roots of the modern Chinese worker in
   the nineteenth-century coolie trade and reconstructs the transnational
   context of class formation in China. It demonstrates that the coolie
   trade in the age of colonial competition precipitated the creation of a
   labour market in China through colonial coercion. Ironically, the
   proliferation of overseas work opportunities and the shared knowledge of
   the coolie experience carried labour to the centre of anti-colonial and
   anti-dynastic struggles in China while offering a critique of the
   debilitation of global labour movements by racial thinking.},

Abstract = {The recent discovery of yet another (small) publication by Schmitt is
   more than just an interesting fact by itself for ardent Schmitt
   scholars. Including previously unknown archival material, the discovery
   sheds new light on three contexts of Schmitt's relationship to his
   former favorite student Otto Kirchheimer: First, on the breakup of their
   personal contact as a consequence of George Schwab's failed attempt to
   receive a PhD grade at Columbia University for his study on Schmitt in
   1961; second, on the hidden connections between Schmitt's and
   Kirchheimer's concepts of politicaljustice; and third, on Kirchheimer's
   previously unknown contribution to Hannah Arendt's book Eichmann in
   Jerusalem.},

Distinguem-se na medida em que esta ultima e sancionada apenas pelo ordenamento social, o que confirma a contraposicao entre direito estadual e direito natural ou social. Nao obstante, nao se deve entender que estas obrigacoes sejam de todo privadas de juridicidade, ja que sendo contempladas pelo direito, ainda que limitadamente, se tornam relacoes juridicas..

Title = {Boundary assembly: An institutional proposal for democratizing
   membership politics},
Journal = {GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 12},
Abstract = {How should democratic communities decide who should belong? Recent
   debates about issues such as voting rights for prisoners,
   denationalization policies or citizenship tests raise this fundamental
   democratic question. While many scholars argue that decisions about
   citizenship and voting rights should be more inclusive of subjected
   outsiders and more independent from electoral partisan politics, we
   still lack institutional proposals for inclusive and independent
   membership politics. This article contributes to the nascent
   institutional turn in the debate about democratic membership boundaries.
   My aim is to show that normative debates about membership politics can
   benefit from recent advances in democratic theory on sortition-based
   democratic innovations, constructive representation and systems
   thinking. I argue that membership politics could be democratized by
   introducing a randomly selected political institution, which I call
   `boundary assembly', that equally represents members and nonmembers and
   is charged with making binding decisions on a subset of a state's
   membership questions. I argue that the strongest objections to empowered
   randomly selected assemblies (shortcut objection, alienation objection,
   capture objection, technocracy objection) lose most of their force in
   the `extraordinary' political context of decisions on membership
   boundaries. Boundary assemblies cannot `solve' the democratic boundary
   problem, but they could be a first step toward more democratic
   membership politics.},

Title = {Vetoes, deadlock and deliberative umpiring: Toward a proportionality
   doctrine for power-sharing constitutions},
Journal = {GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 12},
Abstract = {This article addresses power-sharing constitutions that include powers
   of veto wielded by discrete ethnonational groups. Such constitutional
   arrangements - seen, for example, in Northern Ireland and Bosnia - have
   often prompted severe deadlock, a problem that in turn threatens
   democratic functioning and raises the risk of renewed communal violence.
   We consider the use of `umpires' of power-sharing constitutional systems
   to vet the use of vetoes and (potentially) to prevent their overuse or
   misuse. Power-sharing umpires are not uncommon in practice. However, as
   yet there is little scholarship evaluating how, in substance,
   power-sharing veto umpires should approach their task. Relying on
   deliberative democracy theory, the article outlines three forms of
   `deliberative agreement' that, in principle, deeply divided groups may
   reach in the course of policymaking. It goes on to explain how existing
   proportionality doctrines drawn from federalism and rights cases can be
   imported into the power-sharing context to `scaffold' these broad
   ideals. This approach, it is argued, may provide a more detailed,
   coherent and practically workable approach to umpiring power-sharing
   constitutions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF RACE ETHNICITY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 6},
Abstract = {This paper explores whether attitudes toward ethnic nationalism among
   Black and Asian Americans influence attitudes toward the Black Lives
   Matter Movement. Acceptance of a nationalist ideology typically makes an
   individual animus towards outgroups. Moreover, ethnic/Black nationalism
   is known to flare in times of perceived intense oppression. Given
   current racial tensions in the United States, we are interested in
   examining factors that may help facilitate alliance-building between
   Black and Asian Americans-two nonwhite groups that exist on different
   planks of the U.S. racial hierarchy. We begin by recounting historical
   and contemporary instances of Afro-Asian solidarity and conflict. This
   is followed by a review of past theoretical articulation and empirical
   research on nationalist ideology within each community. We develop a set
   of group-specific indicators of ethnic nationalism for Black and Asian
   Americans from the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey.
   Our results show clear evidence that being sympathetic to ethnic
   nationalism can unite rather than divide the two racialized communities
   in their attitudes toward present-day projects such as the Black Lives
   Matter Movement.},

Abstract = {Quelle est l'influence de la marginalisation des communaut \& eacute;s
   des r \& eacute;gions limitrophes par l'\& Eacute;tat sur leur sentiment
   d'appartenance ? Nous affirmons que, dans les r \& eacute;gions
   instables des pays du Sud, une telle marginalisation renforce le
   sentiment d'appartenance personnel \& agrave; une communaut \& eacute;
   transnationale. Comme nous le d \& eacute;montrons, deux m \&
   eacute;canismes causaux rendent compte de ce processus : la
   marginalisation renforce (i) la qualit \& eacute; << dissimulatrice >>
   de la fronti \& egrave;re qui rend diff \& eacute;rentes formes d'ins \&
   eacute;curit \& eacute; plus confuses; et (ii) la qualit \& eacute; <<
   facilitatrice >> de la fronti \& egrave;re qui permet \& agrave;
   certains acteurs et activit \& eacute;s de traverser les fronti \&
   egrave;res tout en en arr \& ecirc;tant d'autres. La consolidation du
   sentiment d'appartenance personnel \& agrave; une communaut \& eacute;
   transnationale s'accompagne d'implications pour l'\& Eacute;tat, car la
   perte d'une partie de ses citoyens au b \& eacute;n \& eacute;fice de
   cette communaut \& eacute; transnationale nuit \& agrave; son autorit \&
   eacute; et \& agrave; la relation entre \& Eacute;tat et soci \&
   eacute;t \& eacute;. Nous fondant sur le cas des r \& eacute;gions
   limitrophes colombiennes-v \& eacute;n \& eacute;zu \& eacute;liennes,
   nous \& eacute;tayons notre argument \& agrave; l'aide d'\& eacute;l \&
   eacute;ments probants recueillis lors d'un travail de terrain
   approfondi, notamment des entretiens et des groupes de discussion avec
   des paysans et d'autres r \& eacute;sidents de r \& eacute;gions
   limitrophes \& eacute;loign \& eacute;es, ainsi qu'avec des parties
   prenantes de l'\& Eacute;tat et de la soci \& eacute;t \& eacute;
   civile. Nous contribuons \& agrave; la recherche sur l'identit \&
   eacute; et le sentiment d'appartenance en th \& eacute;orisant son lien
   avec la marginalisation dans le contexte des fronti \& egrave;res
   internationales. Par ailleurs, nous apportons une contribution empirique
   en documentant les pratiques et activit \& eacute;s transfrontali \&
   egrave;res m \& eacute;connues des r \& eacute;sidents de la r \&
   eacute;gion frontali \& egrave;re partag \& eacute;e du d \&
   eacute;partement colombien Cesar et de l'\& Eacute;tat v \& eacute;n \&
   eacute;zu \& eacute;lien de Zulia.
   \& iquest;C \& oacute;mo influye la marginaci \& oacute;n de las
   comunidades fronterizas por parte de un Estado sobre el sentido de
   pertenencia de las mismas? Argumentamos que, en regiones inestables del
   Sur Global, esta marginaci \& oacute;n refuerza el sentido de
   pertenencia de las personas a una comunidad transnacional. Demostramos
   que existen dos mecanismos causales, los cuales son los causantes de
   este proceso: en primer lugar, la marginaci \& oacute;n acent \&
   uacute;a la cualidad << disfrazadora >> de la frontera, la cual enturbia
   diversas formas de inseguridad y, en segundo lugar, la marginaci \&
   oacute;n acent \& uacute;a la cualidad << facilitadora >> de la
   frontera, la cual permite que ciertos agentes y actividades crucen las
   fronteras mientras detienen a otros. La consolidaci \& oacute;n del
   sentido de pertenencia a una comunidad transnacional por parte de las
   personas tiene implicaciones para el Estado, ya que la p \& eacute;rdida
   de parte de su ciudadan \& iacute;a a manos de esta comunidad
   transnacional menoscaba tanto su propia autoridad como la relaci \&
   oacute;n Estado-sociedad. Partimos de la base del caso de la frontera
   colombiano-venezolana, el cual nos permite fundamentar nuestra hip \&
   oacute;tesis a trav \& eacute;s de las evidencias recogidas durante un
   trabajo de campo en profundidad. Este trabajo de campo incluye
   entrevistas y grupos focales con campesinos y otros residentes de
   regiones fronterizas remotas, as \& iacute; como con agentes del Estado
   y de la sociedad civil. Este art \& iacute;culo realiza una contribuci
   \& oacute;n al trabajo acad \& eacute;mico en materia de identidad y
   sentido de pertenencia, ya que teoriza sobre el v \& iacute;nculo de
   ambas con la marginaci \& oacute;n en el contexto de las fronteras
   internacionales. Adem \& aacute;s, el art \& iacute;culo realiza una
   contribuci \& oacute;n emp \& iacute;rica ya que documenta pr \&
   aacute;cticas y actividades transfronterizas poco conocidas por parte de
   los residentes de la regi \& oacute;n fronteriza compartida del
   departamento colombiano del Cesar y el Estado Zulia en Venezuela.},

Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 21},
Abstract = {This article explores the application of feminist critical friendship
   (FCF) as a research approach to study institutional change in academic
   settings, contributing to feminist institutionalism-informed research
   with ethical and methodological reflections. Discussing the theoretical
   underpinnings of FCF, its practical application in academia and the
   ethical considerations of conducting research as an insider, the study
   underscores the importance of adopting a feminist ethic of care,
   acknowledging the complex reality of gender reform and the role of
   change agents in navigating and implementing change. It highlights the
   potential of FCF to foster collaborative and horizontal relationships
   between researchers and participants, aiming for knowledge production
   that reflects the nuanced reality of institutional change.},

Abstract = {Previous work suggests that African American and Latino voters lack
   political cohesiveness. Recently, these findings have been cited by
   opponents of `` minority aggregation,{''} which is the idea that African
   Americans and Latinos can be thought of as constituting a single ``
   class of citizens{''} when filing claims under the Voting Rights Act. I
   replicate one influential study, Rocha (2007), with updated data and
   greater attentiveness to moderating conditions that are meaningful in
   voting rights law. My findings suggest African Americans and Latinos are
   more cohesive than previously thought, especially in majority-minority
   jurisdictions. Furthermore, cohesion cannot be explained solely by
   shared partisanship.},

Abstract = {In this article, I examine court-purging in democratic transitions
   through the lens of judicial preferences. Specifically, I address the
   debate on how court-purging during a democratic transition affects the
   likelihood of future court-purging. I argue that the prevailing
   assumption is one of static, sincere judicial preferences. In contrast,
   I explicitly recognize the role of dynamic judicial preferences and
   incentives. This recognition suggests that transitional court-purging
   could be minimal and cautious, while the broader judicial context may
   eventually achieve the same policy outcomes. The dynamic perspective is
   crucial for understanding past court-purging strategies and for
   informing the conceptual debate about the rule of law in transitional
   justice.},

Title = {Establishing the Health Governance of Flows: Authority Performances and
   Expertise at the International Sanitary Conference of 1892},

Abstract = {At the 1892 International Sanitary Conference in Venice, experts
   established international health politics as governing the flows of
   people, traffic, and information. This focus has remained ingrained in
   current health politics and shaped the international response to the
   COVID-19 pandemic. This paper focuses on the micropolitics among these
   experts to understand the emergence of such governance expertise. In
   Venice, experts struggled to perform authority as European governments
   were unwilling to accept authoritative international expert practice. In
   response, the experts limited the role of international politics to
   regulating the movements of information, traffic, and people to make
   their expertise more agreeable. Such compromising governance expertise
   entailed two acts of silencing. The experts claimed that interventions
   that limited themselves to governing these flows were still highly
   effective and also silenced the de facto intrusiveness of their
   expertise into colonized sites. Combining classical sociology with
   science and technology studies, this article contributes conceptually by
   detailing how authority performances affect governance expertise.
   Contributing to the history of international relations, I show how the
   notion of international health politics as governing flows-rather than
   targeting ill health with global sanitary reform-became established in
   the late nineteenth century.
   Lors de la Conf \& eacute;rence sanitaire internationale de 1892 \&
   agrave; Venise, les experts ont d \& eacute;fini que la politique
   sanitaire internationale r \& eacute;gissait les flux de personnes, de
   trafic et d'informations. Cet angle reste tenace dans la politique
   sanitaire actuelle et a fa \& ccedil;onn \& eacute; la r \& eacute;ponse
   internationale \& agrave; la pand \& eacute;mie de Covid-19. Cet article
   se focalise sur la micropolitique de ces experts pour comprendre l'\&
   eacute;mergence de ce genre d'expertise de la gouvernance. \& Agrave;
   Venise, les experts ont rencontr \& eacute; quelque difficult \& eacute;
   \& agrave; exercer leur autorit \& eacute;, car les gouvernements europ
   \& eacute;ens n'\& eacute;taient pas enclins \& agrave; accepter

   eacute;ponse, les experts ont limit \& eacute; le r \& ocirc;le de la
   politique internationale \& agrave; la r \& eacute;glementation des
   mouvements de l'information, du trafic et des personnes pour rendre leur
   expertise plus acceptable. Ce compromis d'expertise de gouvernance
   impliquait deux passages sous silence. Les experts ont affirm \& eacute;
   que les interventions qui se limitaient \& agrave; r \& eacute;gir ces
   flux manquaient encore cruellement d'efficacit \& eacute; et passaient
   sous silence le caract \& egrave;re de facto intrusif de leur expertise
   sur les sites colonis \& eacute;s. Combinant la sociologie classique aux
   \& eacute;tudes des sciences et des techniques, cet article apporte une
   contribution conceptuelle en d \& eacute;taillant l'effet de l'exercice
   de l'autorit \& eacute; sur l'expertise en gouvernance. Je contribue \&
   agrave; l'histoire des relations internationales en montrant comment la
   notion de politique sanitaire internationale en tant que flux
   d'administration, et non comme visant les causes profondes de la
   mauvaise sant \& eacute; avec une r \& eacute;forme sanitaire mondiale,

   egrave;cle.
   Durante la Conferencia Sanitaria Internacional que tuvo lugar en 1892 en
   Venecia, los expertos establecieron que la pol \& iacute;tica sanitaria
   internacional deb \& iacute;a regir los flujos de personas, de tr \&
   aacute;fico y de la informaci \& oacute;n. Este enfoque ha permanecido
   arraigado en las pol \& iacute;ticas sanitarias actuales y ha dado forma
   a la respuesta internacional con relaci \& oacute;n a la pandemia de
   COVID-19. Este art \& iacute;culo se centra en la micropol \&
   iacute;tica que tuvo lugar entre estos expertos con el fin de comprender
   el surgimiento de dicha experiencia en materia de gobernanza. En
   Venecia, los expertos tuvieron dificultades para poder ejercer su
   autoridad, ya que los Gobiernos europeos no estaban dispuestos a aceptar
   la pr \& aacute;ctica autoritativa de los expertos internacionales. En
   respuesta, los expertos limitaron el papel de la pol \& iacute;tica
   internacional a la regulaci \& oacute;n de los movimientos de informaci
   \& oacute;n, tr \& aacute;fico y personas con el fin de hacer que su
   experiencia resultase m \& aacute;s conveniente. Esta experiencia en
   materia de gobernanza, tan comprometida, implic \& oacute; dos actos de
   silenciamiento. Los expertos afirmaron que las intervenciones que se
   limitaban a controlar estos flujos segu \& iacute;an siendo muy eficaces
   y que, tambi \& eacute;n, silenciaban el car \& aacute;cter intrusivo de
   facto de su experiencia en los sitios colonizados. Este art \&
   iacute;culo combina la sociolog \& iacute;a cl \& aacute;sica con los
   estudios de ciencia y tecnolog \& iacute;a, y contribuye en t \&
   eacute;rminos conceptuales al detallar c \& oacute;mo influyen las
   actuaciones autoritativas sobre la experiencia de gobernanza.

   demostrando c \& oacute;mo la noci \& oacute;n de la pol \& iacute;tica

Title = {Counter-Archiving Migration: Tracing the Records of Protests against
   UNHCR},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The archives of migration are piecemeal and scattered. This is both an
   epistemological problem, and a matter of political concern in an
   international order that forces people to migrate, racializes them, and
   renders them subject to violence. In response, we explore the potential
   of counter-archiving migration. First, we explain why archives matter
   politically, and consider which traces of migration are stored and which
   are absent or lost. Second, we develop a methodology for
   counter-archiving migration. Third, we illustrate a process of
   counter-archiving, taking protests and violent evictions outside the UN
   Refugee Agency (UNHCR) offices as an analytical lens. We begin with an
   ``along the grain{''} reading of official archives; we then turn to
   ethnography to trace the memories, practices, and material remnants of
   migrants' struggles. Our analysis makes the case for counter-archival
   work in and beyond the field of migration. We argue that this approach
   serves to disrupt the epistemic violence of classification systems and
   categories associated with border violence; to chart the contestations
   and transformations of the global order from below; and to articulate
   new horizons of justice.
   Les archives de la migration sont parcellaires et \& eacute;parpill \&
   eacute;es. Il s'agit \& agrave; la fois d'un probl \& egrave;me \&

   politique au sein d'un ordre international qui force les gens \& agrave;
   migrer, les racialise et les assujettit \& agrave; la violence. En r \&
   eacute;ponse, nous explorons le potentiel du contre-archivage de la
   migration. D'abord, nous expliquons pourquoi les archives importent sur
   le plan politique, et nous int \& eacute;ressons aux traces de migration
   stock \& eacute;es, et \& agrave; celles qui sont absentes ou perdues.
   Ensuite, nous d \& eacute;veloppons une m \& eacute;thodologie pour le
   contre-archivage de la migration. Enfin, nous illustrons un processus de
   contre-archivage, en adoptant l'angle d'analyse des manifestations et
   des expulsions violentes \& agrave; l'ext \& eacute;rieur des bureaux de
   l'UNHCR. Nous commen \& ccedil;ons par une lecture << dans le sens >>
   des archives officielles pour ensuite nous tourner vers l'ethnographie
   pour retracer les m \& eacute;moires, pratiques et vestiges mat \&
   eacute;riels des \& eacute;preuves des migrants. Notre analyse plaide en
   faveur du travail de contre-archivage dans le domaine de la migration et
   au-del \& agrave;. Nous affirmons que cette approche sert \& agrave;
   bouleverser la violence \& eacute;pist \& eacute;mique des syst \&
   egrave;mes de classification et des cat \& eacute;gories associ \&

   Los archivos en materia de migraci \& oacute;n son fragmentarios y
   dispersos. Se trata de un problema epistemol \& oacute;gico y de
   preocupaci \& oacute;n pol \& iacute;tica dentro de un orden
   internacional que obliga a las personas a migrar, las racializa y las
   somete a la violencia. En respuesta a esto, estudiamos el potencial que
   tiene la migraci \& oacute;n de contra-archivo. En primer lugar,
   explicamos por qu \& eacute; los archivos tienen importancia pol \&
   iacute;tica, y consideramos qu \& eacute; rastros de migraci \& oacute;n
   se almacenan y cu \& aacute;les est \& aacute;n ausentes o se han
   perdido. En segundo lugar, desarrollamos una metodolog \& iacute;a con
   el fin de contrarrestar la migraci \& oacute;n de contra-archivo. En
   tercer lugar, ilustramos un proceso de contra-archivo, tomando como
   lente anal \& iacute;tica las protestas y los desalojos violentos que
   tuvieron lugar frente a las oficinas de ACNUR. Comenzamos con una
   lectura << en profundidad >> de los archivos oficiales. A continuaci \&
   oacute;n, recurrimos a la etnograf \& iacute;a con el fin de analizar
   las memorias, las pr \& aacute;cticas y los vestigios materiales de las
   luchas de los migrantes. Nuestro an \& aacute;lisis aboga por el trabajo
   de contra-archivo en el campo de la migraci \& oacute;n y m \& aacute;s
   all \& aacute; de este. Argumentamos que este enfoque sirve para:
   interrumpir la violencia epist \& eacute;mica de los sistemas de
   clasificaci \& oacute;n y de las categor \& iacute;as asociadas con la
   violencia fronteriza, esbozar desde abajo las impugnaciones y
   transformaciones del orden global, y articular nuevos horizontes de
   justicia.},

Abstract = {Does gender influence how candidates in the United States present their
   prior political experience to voters? Messaging one's experience might
   demonstrate a history of power-seeking behavior, a gender role violation
   for women under traditional norms. As a result, men should be more
   likely to make experience-based appeals than women candidates. For
   evidence, we analyze the contents of 1,030 televised advertisements from
   2018 state legislative candidates from the Wesleyan Media Project. We
   find that ads sponsored by experienced men are significantly more likely
   to highlight experience than ads sponsored by experienced women.
   However, we find that women's and men's ads are roughly equally likely
   to discuss work experience, suggesting that men's greater emphasis on
   experience is limited to prior officeholding. The results contribute to
   our understanding of gender dynamics in political campaigns, the
   information available to voters, and how advertising shapes the criteria
   voters use to assess candidates.},

Abstract = {How can decarbonization governance endure under increasing geoeconomic
   distress? Global tensions threaten to divert financial and political
   resources from the green transition toward national security issues.
   However, we lack the analytical tools to assess decarbonization
   governance in this age of global rivalries. To address this gap, we
   develop an analytical framework to study the effects of geoeconomic
   shocks through investment, operational, and political channels. Using
   macro- and company-level data and document analysis, we empirically test
   our framework using Germany's decarbonization governance following the
   cutoff of its Russian gas supply in 2022 as a case study. We find that
   this shock had negative short-term effects on decarbonization via the
   operational channel, mixed effects via the political channel, and
   positive long-term effects via the investment channel. Our framework and
   findings contribute to establishing climate change and energy politics
   as core issues for future political economy research.},

Abstract = {Rising powers typically seek to play a larger role in international
   economic affairs, but we know little about the impact of this overseas
   expansion on domestic publics. This paper examines the domestic
   political consequences of rising states' efforts to increase their
   foreign economic influence. We argue that public approval for these
   governments depends on whether they succeed or fail to expand their
   country's global economic influence. To test this argument, we fielded
   three survey experiments in China, each focusing on a different
   component of China's foreign economic strategy. In all three
   experiments, informing individuals that China has failed in increasing
   its role in the global economy reduced average levels of government
   satisfaction. Our evidence suggests that this drop in government
   approval operates through a weakened sense of national pride, rather
   than other channels based on economic prospects.},

Abstract = {Political economists have long recognized the power of ideas to
   influence economic adjustment by shaping public policy and fostering
   inter-firm coordination. This article extends this argument,
   demonstrating how ideas can have a direct and unmediated impact on
   economic restructuring. More specifically, it identifies discursive
   cooperation, or collective storytelling, as a distinct logic of
   collective action, separate from policy concertation and inter-firm
   coordination. Examining twenty first century Iceland, this article
   illustrates how shared narratives accelerated the country's movement
   into financial services and tourism by facilitating the diffusion of new
   business models and attracting external resources. Absent inter-firm
   coordination, policy concertation, or supportive public policies,
   however, stakeholders struggled to invest in public goods. Instead of
   incremental upmarket movement, Iceland was characterized by volatile
   boom-bust dynamics. In illustrating the transformative power of
   storytelling in small open economies, this article simultaneously
   highlights the perils of relying on discursive cooperation alone.},

Title = {Making and maintaining corporate empires: the political economy of FDI,

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {32},

Abstract = {A common assumption in political economy theories of foreign direct
   investment (FDI) is that capital mobility declines once the
   multinational corporation (MNC) commits resources to a host site. It
   follows that the logic governing firm behavior changes after entry - a
   dynamic that has been too often neglected in the existing literature. I
   address the matter here, presenting a two-phase theory of FDI. During
   the `partnership initiation' phase, firm decision-making follows an
   anticipatory logic; but this switches to an adaptive logic during the
   `partnership maintenance' phase. I consider how this affects firms'
   responsiveness to the host's macro-political and economic environment,
   deriving distinct hypotheses that reflect the theorized change in FDI
   decision-making from one phase to the next. I test these hypotheses
   against data on FDI positions for more than 20,000 MNCs between 1994 and
   2018. The evidence is consistent with the argument. As FDI research
   moves forward, we need to think not only about firm preferences, but
   also about firm behavior and how it changes with context.},

Abstract = {International organizations promoting democratic governance and human
   rights are increasingly challenged by some of their own member states.
   To better understand this dynamic, we propose a distinction between the
   illiberal ideology of political parties and their regime environment,
   aiming to examine the international behavior of actors extending beyond
   autocratic governments. We argue that the domestic regime environment
   plays a pivotal role in influencing the extent to which illiberal
   parties engage in contestation to undermine liberal norms on the
   international stage. We expect contestation behavior to be primarily
   driven by illiberal parties seeking to diminish the influence of liberal
   international politics on domestic power structures. Moreover, we
   contend that government participation moderates illiberal parties'
   contestation behavior. To test our expectations empirically, we study
   roll call votes in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe
   (PACE), one of the most powerful international parliaments promoting
   liberal values. Drawing on an original dataset that records
   approximately 500,000 individual votes cast in PACE decisions, we find
   evidence for substantive contestation by illiberal parties, especially
   those representing illiberal regimes. Only illiberal governments in
   liberal systems moderate themselves at the amendment stage. Our study
   has implications for the potential threat that emerging illiberal actors
   pose to international liberal institutions.},

Abstract = {Forced sterilisation, a serious violation of human rights, occurred
   across the former communist bloc, both during and after the socialist
   period. This study examines the case of the Czech Republic, where
   legislation regarding compensation to the victims of forced
   sterilisation was only passed in 2021, despite a 2005 finding by the
   Ombudsman that at least 50 women had been subject to the procedure. My
   research shows that long-standing discrimination against Roma people and
   public lack of interest in the issue were largely to blame for this
   delay.},

Abstract = {Following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, the city of Minneapolis
   grappled with shattered community trust, record rates of violence, and
   low officer morale. Balancing the interests of crime prevention and
   social justice in the community that the authors of this article serve
   is a vital concern, as it is in so many other cities and jurisdictions.
   Our perspective on crime prevention and social justice emphasizes
   transparency, community partnerships, and evaluative metrics, and we
   argue for and reflect on that approach here. By implementing practical,
   purposeful, and informed policy changes, the Minneapolis Police
   Department and our community have made significant strides forward in
   both building capacity for community trust and launching crime
   prevention initiatives.},

Title = {In Search of Effective Corporate Grievance Mechanisms: Can Mandatory Due
   Diligence Laws be a Progressive Force?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Mandatory human rights due diligence (mHRDD) laws are currently being
   proposed and/or implemented in countries around the world. Increasingly,
   these laws place obligations on corporations to establish or participate
   in corporate grievance mechanisms (CGMs). CGMs have the potential to
   ensure that rightsholders are empowered to hold corporations accountable
   for their human rights performance. But our limited knowledge of how
   CGMs operate indicates that many are not producing results that are
   valuable for workers and communities. CGM provisions in mHRDD laws in
   Germany and Norway, and draft laws produced in the European Union and
   Brazil are rudimentary and unlikely to produce better-performing CGMs.
   Analysis of Norwegian mHRDD corporate reporting identifies that many
   corporations fail to understand the basic elements of an effective CGM.
   The article therefore argues that requirements for CGMs in mHRDD laws
   will only be a progressive move if such laws also demand disclosure of
   information that empowers national authorities, as well as civil society
   actors and researchers, to scrutinize CGMs to ensure they are effective.
   Disclosure requirements must speak to three issues: (1) how accessible
   CGMs are, (2) the way complaints are handled, and (3) the remedies
   provided to rightsholders. If, as a result of scrutiny of this data,
   mHRDD laws can produce well-functioning CGMs, this could lead to
   rightsholder concerns becoming more central to due diligence processes,
   potentially addressing cosmetic compliance with due diligence
   obligations.},

Abstract = {Scholars look to early modern canonical texts to understand the
   philosophical underpinnings of R2P. Meanwhile, critiques argue these
   origins couch Western imperial intentions. This article complicates the
   story by returning to a pivotal historical moment- the Spanish encounter
   with the Aztecs- to explore protective war from an overlooked angle:
   that of Spain's indigenous allies, the Tlaxcaltecas. Despite being
   oppressed by the imperialistic Aztecs, canonical Western texts related
   to R2P and post-colonial critiques both elide the Tlaxcaltecas'
   precarious agency- the rights and duties moulded by endemic structures
   of violence before, during, and after protective intervention- by
   problematically embracing simple binaries of European oppressor and
   indigenous oppressed. Restoring the Tlaxcaltecas to the story
   complicates tropes about imperial projections of force and the pervasive
   assumption in R2P discussions of the `innocent oppressed'. Our
   conclusions provide new perspective from which to view future Pillar 3
   dilemmas by recognising that the protected sometimes have a bellicose
   role to play.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the economic and fiscal consequences of Russia's
   full-scale invasion of Ukraine for subnational governments in Russia.
   Using annual fiscal and economic data, we study how different groups of
   regions have been affected by the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war. Despite
   the Russian economy being more resilient to a sanctions shock than
   initially predicted, we document several important negative tendencies
   at the regional level, sometimes overlooked in policy discussions and
   the literature on economic sanctions. In this article, we present new
   regional data and focus on the effects of the war on overall regional
   tax collections in 2022-2023, as well as the dynamics of different types
   of regional and federal taxes. We identify several groups of
   ``winners{''} (oil- and gas-extracting regions, weapons-producing
   regions, and the largest city-regions) and ``losers{''} (regions that
   share a border with Ukraine and regions with sanctions-prone industrial
   specializations) and discuss the prospects of their resilience.},

Abstract = {Why would weak states accept rules which authorize strong states to take
   coercive action against them? I argue that, in some cases, this is a way
   of creating constraints over the exercise power in the form of
   procedural checks, or rules delineating the process through which power
   can legitimately be exercised. If stronger states become willing to
   exercise power against weak states in the absence of rules formally
   authorizing their behavior, this presents their actions as the new
   status quo. In response, weak states can attempt to re-establish
   constraints over the exercise of power by formally sanctioning unwanted
   actions, but doing so alongside procedural checks. To assess this
   argument, I examine the addition of a human rights suspension clause to
   the Lome Convention, an aid and preferential trade agreement between the
   European Economic Community and the African, Caribbean, and Pacific
   (ACP) group of states. The ACP states accepted a suspension clause after
   nearly twenty years of arguing that such a clause was paternalistic and
   violated the norm of non-interference. Explanations for this decision
   that point to one-sided dominance of IOs by the strong or
   straightforward support for policies on the part of the weak cannot
   account for important dynamics, including continued objections to the
   practice of suspension by ACP states and the willingness of European
   states to accept and utilize procedural checks.},

Abstract = {The project of European integration has been battered by repeated crises
   since the turn of the second millennium. However, in contrast to earlier
   periods in its history, when it responded to difficulties by adding new
   competencies to its repertoire of powers, since 2000, the deepening of
   integration has stalled. This article addresses why this is happening -
   and why this is happening now, 70 years after the foundation of the
   European Communities - using the paradigm of collective memory. More
   specifically, I argue that generational dynamics are crucial for
   understanding development of European integration. I identify and
   analyse the memories of three cohorts of leaders: the `founders' of the
   1950s, the `deepeners' of the 1980s and 1990s and the current generation
   of `sceptics'. Based on this analysis, I conclude that debates about the
   European Union's (EU's) finalite politique should be set aside until a
   younger, more pro-European cohort of leaders has come to power.},

Abstract = {Sanctions are increasingly prominent foreign policy tools, but research
   on the policy process that leads to specific sanction design is limited.
   Sanctions can have unintended effects on the provision of humanitarian
   aid in sanctioned countries, which has led to calls for humanitarian
   exceptions in sanction design. This study focuses on non-governmental
   organizations' (NGOs) advocacy for a humanitarian perspective on
   European Union (EU) sanctions in the period 2020-2021. Building on the
   Advocacy Coalition Framework and the triangulation of qualitative data
   sources including interviews and document analysis, this study describes
   an advocacy coalition of humanitarian NGOs in Brussels, their advocacy
   strategies and the effectiveness of these strategies. The analysis
   highlights the coalition's common policy beliefs and documents three
   advocacy strategies: coalition building, knowledge leadership and
   lobbying. The analysis then traces the link between these strategies and
   recent policy changes, namely, clearer European Commission guidelines on
   the implementation of humanitarian derogations. This policy change was
   further facilitated by policy brokers and an external shock, the
   Covid-19 pandemic. The findings shed light on an understudied design
   feature of sanctions, i.e., humanitarian exceptions, and on the role of
   non-governmental actors in shaping sanction designs.},

Abstract = {Objectives: the present work seeks to remove the traditional and
   immovable conception of the Associations of Municipalities, to, through
   their reconversion, but without giving up their most solid foundations,
   convert them into local administrative instruments, of the first order,
   for the transformation of the rural areas most in need of
   sustainability, rural development and the fight against depopulation.
   Methodology: the research is based on academic literature (doctrinal
   positions) on European, state and regional legal provisions and on
   constitutional jurisprudence, all of which focuses on the Associations
   of Municipalities Using the most modern doctrinal and normative
   positions. Results: starting from a conceptual modernization of the
   Associations of Municipalities (2.0), the result of a deep reflection
   and in step with the new times, can it be possible for these local
   entities, without implying a disruptive change with their past, to make
   the new policies operational emerging public initiatives aimed at
   achieving economic, social and environmental sustainability, the rural
   development of territories and people, as well as the establishment and
   attraction of population, in particular, in the smallest municipalities,
   which are the ones they traditionally serve and the that present a lower
   penetration of such policies. Conclusions: To achieve this complex
   challenge, it is essential to provide the public managers of the joint
   municipalities with adequate legal coverage that must be provided both
   from the basic local legislation of the State and from the development
   legislation on the local regime of the Autonomous Communities.},

Title = {International Political Sociology through the Colonial Mirror: A
   Contrapuntal Reading of the Spanish Civil War},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {This paper invokes Edward Said's notion of counterpoint to present a
   transnational sociological account of the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939.
   This contrapuntal reading raises questions of sovereignty, violence, and
   identity, which-filtered through a political sociological lens-offer
   novel perspectives on the power of empire and colonialism in relation to
   these key IR categories. Specifically, I argue that the Spanish colonial
   frontier in Morocco served as a laboratory for distinctive expressions
   of transnational state-building, violence, and identity-formation, which
   were reproduced in the metropolitan heartlands of the Iberian Peninsula
   during the interwar years. The complex interaction between core and
   periphery in this period had momentous implications for both Spanish and
   Moroccan history, many of which continue to play out in contemporary
   politics across the Gibraltar Strait.
   Cet article invoque la notion d'Edward Said de contrepoint au recit
   sociologique transnational actuel de la guerre civile espagnole
   (1936-1939). Cette lecture en contrepoint souleve la question de la
   souverainete, de la violence et de l'identite qui, filtree par le biais
   d'un angle sociologique et politique, presente de nouvelles perspectives
   sur la puissance d'un empire et le colonialisme vis-a-vis de ces
   categories cles des RI. Plus precisement, j'affirme que la frontiere
   coloniale espagnole au Maroc a servi de laboratoire a des expressions
   distinctes de la creation d'un etat, de la violence et la formation
   identitaire transnationales, ensuite reproduites dans les centres
   metropolitains de la peninsule iberique lors des annees
   d'entre-deux-guerres. La complexite des interactions entre centre et
   peripherie durant cette periode s'est accompagnee d'implications
   capitales, pour l'histoire espagnole comme pour l'histoire marocaine, et
   nombreuses sont celles qui subsistent en politique contemporaine dans le
   detroit de Gibraltar.
   Este articulo invoca la nocion de contrapunto enunciada por Edward Said
   con el fin de presentar un relato sociologico transnacional de la Guerra
   Civil Espanola, que tuvo lugar entre 1936 y 1939. Esta lectura
   contrapuntistica plantea cuestiones en materia de soberania, violencia e
   identidad, las cuales, filtradas a traves de una lente sociologica
   politica, ofrecen perspectivas novedosas sobre el poder del imperio y el
   colonialismo en relacion con estas categorias clave de las RRII.
   Concretamente, argumentamos que la frontera colonial espanola en
   Marruecos sirvio como laboratorio para ciertas expresiones distintivas
   en materia de construccion de Estado transnacional, de violencia y de
   formacion de identidad, las cuales se reprodujeron en el corazon
   metropolitano de la Peninsula Iberica durante los anos de entreguerras.
   Esta compleja interaccion entre el centro y la periferia durante este
   periodo tuvo implicaciones trascendentales para la historia, tanto
   espanola como marroqui, muchas de las cuales continuan desarrollandose
   en la politica contemporanea al otro lado del Estrecho de Gibraltar.},

Abstract = {Private actors and institutions, and by extension private law itself,
   are increasingly being forced to reckon with a multiplicity of
   challenges that extend beyond the domain of private law as it is
   traditionally conceived. They reflect threats to the global
   constitutional order and liberal constitutionalism, and threats to
   individual and collective fundamental rights and constitutional values.
   As a result, the role of private law in framing and facilitating the
   development of the global economy and globalization often does not fall
   within the direct purview of public international lawyers. This
   editorial aims to examine the role of private law in the litigation and
   enforcement of public interests against the background of the
   public/private divide. This is done in light of the increasing role
   adopted by private actors, including corporations, beyond the private
   realm.},

Abstract = {This article undertakes a comparative analysis of European Union
   security and external economic policies to explore the different
   trajectories of strategic autonomy (SA) in these two domains. In so
   doing, it contributes to a better understanding of endogenous drivers of
   policy change in response to geopoliticising pressures. Drawing on
   discursive institutionalism, it analyses three dimensions of ideational
   power: power in, power through and power over. The evidence, based on
   documentary analysis and interviews, demonstrates that though SA
   presented a more significant challenge to pre-established paradigms in
   external economic relations, the role of the Commission as an ideational
   entrepreneur, supported by its coercive power, facilitated the adoption
   of the idea of (open) SA. Conversely, French President Emmanuel Macron
   was unable to persuade others of the adoption of a sovereigntist
   conception of SA in security, with the exception of defence industrial
   policy, where the Commission enjoys budgetary power and competences.},

Abstract = {In 2006 the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) produced rules of
   engagement in hostilities for members of its armed wing, the Bangsamoro
   Islamic Armed Forces, which reference Islamic law and are also compliant
   with international humanitarian law (IHL). The release of these rules
   came following engagement with the MILF by both national and
   international humanitarian organizations. This article examines the role
   of Islamic scholars in the MILF and how they contributed to the
   development of the rules of engagement and the dissemination of
   humanitarian principles and IHL to its fighters. It also examines the
   support that humanitarian organizations provided to MILF's Islamic
   scholars in their work on IHL. The findings show that MILF's religious
   scholars played a major role in promoting IHL to the group's armed wing
   through a framing of IHL from an Islamic perspective. A major motivation
   for the MILF to engage its Islamic scholars on IHL was the desire for
   international legitimacy as it was involved in a peace process with the
   government of the Philippines.},

Title = {Breaking the iron triangle around nuclear safety regulation: The cases
   of France, Japan, and India},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1246-1263},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The International Atomic Energy Agency asserts that the regulation of
   the safety of civil nuclear power requires national regulatory agencies
   to be effectively independent. However, in the early years of national
   civil nuclear power programs national nuclear industries were dominated
   by iron triangles or subgovernments of powerful actors with an interest
   in promoting the industry. The creation of an independent safety
   regulator requires a radical restructuring of the national governance
   framework. Windows of opportunity or critical junctures for such reform
   occur only occasionally. This paper examines the cases of France, Japan,
   and India to identify the factors that determine the degree of success
   in attempts to break the power of nuclear iron triangles or
   subgovernments and create an effectively independent regulator. This
   analysis shows a serious nuclear accident can create the opportunity to
   dismantle an iron triangle. The extent and speed with which reforms can
   be implemented depend greatly on pre-existing and prevailing conditions.
   Key determinants include the power structures and attitudes toward
   nuclear power in elite politics, the degree of engagement of civil
   society, and pressures from international organizations. Of these, the
   first, elite politics, appears to be the most important in these three
   cases.},

Title = {World Order Transformation from the Grassroots: Global South Social
   Movements and the Transcendence of Established Approaches to
   International Change},

Abstract = {In contrast to traditional top-down perspectives, this article aims to
   shed alternative light on the prospects for change in global order
   through evaluating how perspectives offered among social movements
   located in the Global South consider how change can take place beyond
   established approaches. With reference to perspectives offered among the
   Global Tapestry of Alternatives, the article elucidates a model of
   global political change that transcends reformist and revolutionary
   dynamics, and which bypasses dominant state and intergovernmental
   institutions. The analysis highlights the ontological divide between
   these approaches and reformist and revolutionary perspectives, given
   their pluriversality drawing on concepts that to date have received
   inadequate attention in the study of international relations. The
   article further considers how these approaches-given their deep roots in
   long-established communitarian practices and their pluriversality-may be
   addressing today's crisis of global order from the bottom-up in ways
   that may avoid limitations of previous change agendas.
   Par opposition au point de vue descendant traditionnel, cet article vise
   a presenter les perspectives de changement de l'ordre mondial sous une
   lumiere nouvelle, en evaluant comment les mouvements sociaux situes dans
   l'hemisphere sud envisagent l'intervention du changement au-dela des
   approches etablies. Par reference aux perspectives proposees dans le
   reseau Global Tapestry of Alternatives, l'article explicite un modele de
   changement politique mondial qui transcende les dynamiques reformistes
   et revolutionnaires, et qui passe outre les institutions d'etats
   dominants et intergouvernementales. L'analyse souligne la division
   ontologique entre ces approches et les perspectives reformistes et
   revolutionnaires, etant donne leur pluriversalite qui s'appuie sur des
   concepts qui jusqu'ici n'ont pas recu l'attention qu'il faudrait dans
   l'etude des relations internationales. L'article envisage en outre
   comment ces approches, etant donne qu'elles sont profondement ancrees
   dans des pratiques communautaires etablies de longue date et leur
   pluriversalite, peuvent repondre a la crise actuelle de l'ordre mondial,
   de maniere ascendante et de facon a eviter les limites des programmes de
   changement anterieurs.
   En contraste con las perspectivas tradicionales, que tienen un enfoque
   de arriba hacia abajo, este articulo tiene como objetivo ofrecer una
   vision alternativa sobre las perspectivas de cambio en el orden global a
   traves de la evaluacion de como las perspectivas ofrecidas entre los
   movimientos sociales ubicados en el Sur Global consideran que el cambio
   puede tener lugar mas alla de los enfoques establecidos. El articulo,
   tomando como referencia las perspectivas ofrecidas en el marco del Tapiz
   Global de Alternativas, dilucida un modelo de cambio politico global que
   trasciende las dinamicas reformistas y revolucionarias, y que pasa por
   alto las instituciones estatales e intergubernamentales dominantes. El
   analisis pone de manifiesto la division ontologica entre estos enfoques
   y las perspectivas reformistas y revolucionarias, debido a su
   pluriversidad, a partir de conceptos que hasta la fecha han recibido una
   atencion inadecuada dentro del estudio de las relaciones
   internacionales. El articulo considera, ademas, como estos enfoques,
   debido a que se encuentran enraizados en practicas comunitarias
   establecidas desde hace mucho tiempo y a su pluriversidad, pueden estar
   abordando la crisis actual del orden global de abajo hacia arriba de
   manera que puedan llegar a evitar las limitaciones de las agendas de
   cambio anteriores.},

Abstract = {We revisit a key question about poverty that was a repeated subject of
   investigation for Rebecca Blank, estimating the effects of the business
   cycle on pre-tax-and-transfer and post-tax-and-transfer poverty. Using
   an anchored household-level version of the Supplemental Poverty
   Measure's thresholds and resources, we show that poverty is
   countercyclical, rising in recessions and falling in expansions. We also
   find that the social safety net provides protection against cyclicality:
   Post-tax-and-transfer poverty is less cyclical than is
   pre-tax-and-transfer poverty. The largest cyclicality occurs among
   children and Black and Hispanic persons, and lower cyclicality is
   evident among white and elderly persons. The safety net leads to the
   largest reductions in cyclicality for the elderly and the smallest
   effects for nonelderly households without children. Finally, we find an
   inverted U shape with cyclicality low and rising below 75 percent of
   poverty and declining above.},

Abstract = {This chapter employs a ``systems{''} approach to trace the development
   of rural-urban labour migration in British colonial Southern Rhodesia
   during the mid-twentieth century and uncover why black urban labourers
   struggled to establish permanent roots in burgeoning industrial cities.
   The economic and institutional characteristics of the colony influenced
   the socio-economic opportunities of black Africans in both rural and
   urban areas. As the colony underwent industrialization from the
   mid-1940s onward, rural men increasingly migrated to industrial urban
   centres in search of manufacturing wages that far exceeded the
   perpetually depressed agricultural wages. However, relatively few were
   able to establish permanent urban tenure together with a family over the
   ensuing decades, which resulted in cities with extreme gender imbalances
   among the black community. This was largely a consequence of the broader
   institutional makeup of colonial Southern Rhodesia, which primarily
   served the socioeconomic interests of a small white settler community,
   often at the expense of the colony's black inhabitants.},

   {[}Anonymous], 165 Marshall's decision on the authority of Dartmouth's charter should be understood in the context of a broader antebellum reception of early modern theories of legal interpretation that had, according to some nineteenth-century scholars, been adopted by the framers of the Constitution. As James A. Colaiaco writes: ``According to the seventeenth-century English jurist John Selden, the `one true sense' of a document is that which `the Author meant when he {[}wrote] it.' The court, he argued, must determine `the intention of the King' on the basis of the words of the law alone, and not from extratextual sources. In 1790, John Joseph Powell argued in his treatise on contract law that the intent of the parties to a contract must be derived from their words, from `that which, in common presumption, may be taken to be their intent.' Contract law considers pertinent `external expression,' not `internal sentiments.' According to common law standards, therefore, the intent of a maker of a legal document is inseparable from the intent of the words of the document itself. Americans applied these interpretive canons from common law to the Constitution. H. Jefferson Powell explains: `The Philadelphia framers' primary expectation regarding constitutional interpretation was that the Constitution, like any other legal document, would be interpreted in accord with its express language'{''} (Frederick Douglass and the Fourth of July {[}New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 2006], 100). In early modern legal thought, authorial intention was inseparable from express language. Over time, however, the meaning of intention itself began to split. In modern terms, jurists could be distinguished as either originalists, who took intention to mean the intention of the author of a legal document, or (more loosely) formalists, who defined it as the intention of the document itself, as interpreted by the words based on their present, common usage..

Abstract = {As private asset-based welfare like funded occupational pension schemes
   gain importance, legitimacy concerns arise due to financial market
   downturns and low investment returns. This paper assesses their input
   legitimacy by distinguishing between individual-direct and
   collective-representative input possibilities in decision-making
   processes. We argue that individual-direct input possibilities decrease
   while collective-representative input possibilities increase with
   occupational pensions' compulsion. To test these hypotheses, we compare
   voluntary occupational pension schemes in Austria, Spain, and Ireland
   with (quasi-)mandatory schemes in the Netherlands and Denmark, using
   Germany as a test case due to recent reforms enhancing their importance.
   Our institutional analysis and novel survey reveal that compulsory
   occupational pensions are associated with lower individual-direct and
   higher collective-representative input possibilities. These findings
   underscore the critical role of participatory procedures in establishing
   legitimacy in private governance, suggesting they may strengthen public

   Policy Shifts in Western Europe Since 2008},

Abstract = {Recent studies puzzle over why it is that democratically elected
   governments have not responded to rising inequality by engaging in more
   redistribution. While some scholars argue that low- and middle-income
   citizens have not responded to rising inequality in the way we would
   expect, others argue that policymakers are not responsive to the demands
   of these citizens. We argue that both solutions to the
   ``lack-of-redistribution puzzle{''} leave something to be desired and
   that variation across policy domains sheds new light on the issues at
   stake in this debate. Based on an original 2019 survey replicating
   questions asked by the European Social Survey in 2008, we show that
   support for progressive income taxation and more egalitarian
   unemployment insurance has increased in most West European countries
   since 2008. Tax policy has moved in the same direction as public
   opinion, but unemployment policy has not. We conclude that public
   opinion should be conceived as a constraint on policymakers motivated by
   political-economy considerations rather than a driver of policy
   developments.},

Abstract = {Practitioners and academics recognize the importance of innovative
   intelligence organisations. However, we know little about how
   intelligence organisations innovate and what challenges they are being
   confronted with. Drawing upon intelligence studies as well as innovation
   and organisational studies this paper forwards a conceptual framework to
   answer the question: how do intelligence organisations innovate? To
   address this, we introduce the concept of innovation capability, an
   organisation's potential to innovate. The paper identifies seven
   attributes of innovation capability and explores these attributes within
   intelligence organisations. The attributes are: (1) vision and strategy,
   (2) competence base, (3) organisational intelligence, (4) creativity and
   idea management, (5) organisational structure, (6) culture and climate
   and (7) management of technology. The paper concludes with an agenda for
   further research.},

Abstract = {Vast literature studies Independent Regulatory Agencies (IRAs). We
   contribute by studying the benefits of independence when the agent's
   work is relational and by studying developing and developed democracies
   worldwide and over many years. We do this by studying national Debt
   Management Offices (DMOs)-the state agencies that plan, issue, and
   manage national debt. DMOs define the benchmark assets on which capital
   markets and monetary policy depend-industry standards-and their
   decisions have allocative implications. We argue that formal
   independence of DMOs from political decision-makers is a costly signal
   to large financial institutions on the government's potential to service
   and repay its debts. We introduce a new country-year dataset of DMO
   legislation for 75 developing and developed democratic countries in the
   period 1950-2013. We find that DMO independence is likelier following
   debt defaults, war, high inflation, and high debts, and that DMO
   independence increases sovereign debt credibility.},

Abstract = {Populist actors who conduct democratic backsliding incrementally eat
   away at institutional checks on power. Whilst they largely focus on
   domestic institutions, European Union (EU) member states have an
   international democratic institution to consider as well. In this
   article, we present and test a theory explaining changes in backslider
   rhetoric towards the EU. Whilst they often claim a position of
   Euroscepticism, their interactions with the EU are complicated. We argue
   that anti-democratic actors consider the public perception of the EU and
   the likelihood of enforcement and sanctions from the EU when deciding
   what type of rhetoric to use. Using speeches from Orb \& aacute;n in
   Hungary and Duda in Poland, we find that the effect of public opinion on
   speech sentiment varies between leaders. We also find evidence of
   position blurring in response to increases in EU threat levels.},

Abstract = {The article reviews the design of the criminal justice system and trends
   in crime in Russia over the last two decades (2000-2020). First, we
   argue that the criminal justice system is built upon the idea of meeting
   quotas, which ensures its accountability to the Russian state and
   downplays its transparency and crime-control efficiency. Second, we
   analyse recent crime trends and argue that Russia has experienced a
   long-term drop in crime. Finally, we overview the available evidence on
   the enforcement of drug laws and the operation of the prison system in
   Russia.},

Abstract = {This note presents and analyses the Centre for Applied Legal Studies'
   (CALS) considerations regarding whether to intervene as an amicus curiae
   or a co-applicant in Embrace v. Minister of Justice and Correctional
   Services (Embrace), a legal case which questions the constitutionality
   of the mistaken belief in consent defence in relation to rape (and other
   sexual offences). To present CALS' litigation considerations, which
   formed the decision of whether to intervene in Embrace as an amicus
   curiae or co-applicant, this note presents the legal context around the
   mistaken belief defence. It then expands on CALS' position around the
   framing of mistaken belief, which differs from the two applicants in
   Embrace. Finally, it presents CALS' considerations that were required
   around entering the Embrace case as an applicant as opposed to entering
   as an amicus curia. The considerations included the benefit of
   co-applicants to raise new legal issues, and the forms of recourse
   available to amici versus co-applicants, the principle of the
   `low-hanging fruits', and finally, potential liability around costs.},

Abstract = {The global space industry is booming. While governmental agencies used
   to dominate outer space activities, private space organizations (PSOs)
   now launch rockets, operate strategic satellites, and even take tourists
   on space expeditions. How can we explain this emergence of PSOs?
   Building on organizational ecology theory and drawing on a novel dataset
   of 1751 space organizations and 52 semi-structured interviews, this
   paper finds that mutualistic relations between governmental space
   agencies and PSOs have been instrumental in the rise of PSOs. This
   emphasis on mutualism challenges the prevailing belief that a few
   visionary private entrepreneurs create the space industry from the
   ground up. It also refutes the notion that PSOs simply out-compete a
   stagnant public sector. PSOs have not superseded governmental space
   agencies; they are nurtured by and developed with them. This paper is
   one of the first to explain how private actors can emerge in a field
   historically dominated by governmental actors. In so doing, it
   contributes to studies on public-private interactions by showing how
   mutualism can structure a nascent industry. It also opens up new avenues
   for research on the political economy of outer space by making available
   a rich dataset of space actors.},

Abstract = {The liberal international legal order faces a legitimacy crisis today
   that becomes visible with the recent anti-internationalist turn, the
   rise of populism and the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine. Either its
   authority or legitimacy has been tested many times over the last three
   decades. The article argues that this anti-internationalist trend may be
   read as a reaction against the neoliberal form taken by international
   law, not least over the last three decades. In uncovering the
   intricacies of international law's legitimacy crisis, the article
   uncovers the paradox of global constitutionalism: that its need to adopt
   a sectoral form of integration may cause a legitimacy gap/deficit
   because international authorities, resting their legitimacy primarily on
   instrumental grounds, may face problems in compensating for the
   legitimacy deficit caused by the erosion of domestic sovereignty and
   extending their legitimacy to non-instrumental grounds. This paradox has
   one necessary structural and two contingent content-related implications
   for domestic democracies: (1) it necessarily narrows down the regulatory
   space of nation-states; and this may in turn (2) impair democratic
   stability and solidarity, and (3) provide a fertile ground for populism.
   Drawing on Raz's service conception, the article focuses on the
   interaction between international and domestic authorities and
   highlights the problematic aspects of the neoliberal
   constitutionalization of international law.},

Abstract = {International Organizations (IOs), such as the United Nations (U.N.),
   engage in statebuilding in a range of post-conflict states.
   Statebuilding scholarship largely assumes that IOs, backed by their
   powerful member states, have at least temporary authority over the
   seemingly ``weak{''} states in which they intervene. We argue, in
   contrast, that many post-conflict states shape IO statebuilding efforts
   through many statebuilding contracts, which we call incomplete
   arrangements, that give the post-conflict state the residual rights of
   control over the unnegotiated components of these statebuilding
   contracts with IOs. These incomplete arrangements, as opposed to
   complete takeovers, which are the other type of statebuilding contracts,
   provide procedural ``weapons of the weak state{''} that enable the
   post-conflict state to influence what the IO mandate contains, where it
   intervenes, whom it hires, and when it exits. Using in-depth case
   studies of Burundi, Guatemala, and Timor-Leste, as well as analysis of
   36 U.N. interventions in post-conflict states from 2000-2020, this
   article demonstrates the potential of incomplete arrangement
   statebuilding contracts to give post-conflict states institutional power
   over IO statebuilders, with important implications for scholarship on
   statebuilding and global governance.},

Abstract = {There is disagreement amongst political theorists as to whether a
   European demos based on a culturally grounded identity as a precondition
   for a stronger integration of the European Union (EU) exists. We study a
   part of this question from a constructivist perspective by analysing how
   individuals in Europe perceive European culture and how this perception
   is related to support for the EU. We focus on the following questions:
   (a) whether European respondents perceive a shared European culture, (b)
   whether they consider this culture to be of higher value than other
   cultures and (c) whether they are proud of European cultures. We study
   these questions on the basis of a survey conducted in 2021 in nine
   European countries, including both EU and non-EU countries. Our results
   show that the perception of a shared European culture and its positive
   evaluation, both inclusive and exclusive, covary positively with support
   for the EU.},

Title = {Does fear of harassment reduce women's online political participation?
   Evidence from the British Election Study across three UK general
   elections},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND GENDER},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 23},
Abstract = {Social media has become an important tool for political discussion and
   participation. Furthermore, recently, the question of gendered
   harassment in online political spaces has gained much scholarly
   attention. However, work here has largely focused on elected
   representatives, with little work on how this affects ordinary citizens.
   This article seeks to establish whether there is a gendered online
   participation gap, using data from the British Election Study across
   three elections. It further seeks to reveal why this gap may exist by
   assessing specific questions about being harassed or fearing negative
   responses online. The findings show a persistent gender gap in political
   participation online across all elections studied. Furthermore, although
   women were not necessarily more likely to have been harassed online,
   they were far more likely to have avoided posting about politics for
   fear of a negative response. This suggests that fear of harassment may
   contribute to lower political participation online for women.},

   support malpractices. To better understand this phenomenon, we draw from
   practice theory and conceptualize EU democracy support as practices
   performed by a community of insiders who act within a complex
   constellation of communities of practice. Due to the way in which
   communities function, decision-makers do not critically reflect on the
   background knowledge on which they base their practices and thus do not
   learn how to improve them. This constellation model offers a unique take
   on non-learning within the EU and in (policy-making) groups more
   generally. We illustrate the proposed conceptual framework through an
   empirical analysis of EU democracy support in Egypt, showing that the EU
   performs practices similar to those before the 2011 Revolution due to
   its inability to learn.},

Abstract = {Despite societal progress toward achieving gender equality, women remain
   disadvantaged across all walks of life. We examine how pressures by the
   International Monetary Fund (IMF) for austerity and liberalization
   policies affect women's economic empowerment in developing countries.
   Focusing on labor market outcomes, we expect that IMF programs increase
   the gender unemployment gap. This effect will hold regardless of
   existing societal gender norms, reflecting that women work in less
   `crisis-proof' jobs. In contrast, we believe that prevailing societal
   gender norms will adversely impact women's ability to remain in the
   labor force, resulting in widening gender labor force participation
   gaps. Relying on a dataset covering 128 developing countries between
   1992 and 2018, we confirm these expectations. Our findings underscore
   how, during economically turbulent times, policy demands of the Fund can
   amplify existing gender inequalities.},

Abstract = {The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling abrogating women's long-established
   right to abortion affords an opportunity to better understand how people
   update their attitudes toward the court. The data analyzed here
   reinforce evidence from earlier studies that the Dobbs ruling produced a
   substantial hit to the court's institutional legitimacy. Why and how did
   this occur? A dominant model of attitude change posits that short-term
   evaluations of the court's performance are informed by individual
   rulings and readily evolve but that institutional loyalty originates
   from different sources and is resistant to change. Loyalty is not
   entirely impervious to change, however: This research suggests that
   controversial decisions can cause a realignment of both types of court
   attitudes and that this seems to have happened with Dobbs. But, as I
   show via an experiment, evaluations typically change first, and under
   some (but perhaps extraordinary) circumstances, changed evaluations can
   undermine institutional loyalty.},

Abstract = {Why do leftist forces accept, support and adopt free-market policies? To
   answer this question, we carry out a comparative study of left-wing
   groups (both parties and trade unions) in France, Italy and Spain during
   the late 1970s and the early 1980s. This period is widely acknowledged
   in international political economy to have represented a paradigm shift
   from post-war Keynesianism to neoliberal policy-making. We employ
   in-depth content analysis of memoirs, interviews to the press, opinion
   articles and policy-papers to explain actors' positions on landmark
   policies implemented during such transition. In alignment with a
   developing literature in political economy (e.g. Mudge 2018), we find a
   proactive role of progressives in developing the ideological
   justification for the resort to liberal policies. However, we emphasise
   that widespread consensus among so-called progressives, rather than a
   leading role of technocrats or party experts, best explains such shifts.
   In this way, the paper casts doubts on interpretations of the
   liberalisation process that place excessive emphasis on the role of
   external constraints as well as on elite power. Drawing on Hall (1993),
   we argue that left-wing forces in the early 1980s have enacted a `second
   order change', whereby policymakers use new instruments to meet existing
   policy objectives.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND GENDER},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 25},
Abstract = {Celis and Childs have called for a `second generation' of feminist
   scholarship on representation that foregrounds intersectional
   heterogeneity and emphasises responsiveness to representatives beyond
   parliaments. We build on these important contributions, arguing that
   second-generation feminist scholarship and democratic design can make
   the greatest gains by operationalising intersectionality in close
   alignment with its origins in Black feminism and critical race theory.
   First, to foreground intersectional heterogeneity, we posit that
   feminist scholarship on representation must shift away from the
   overarching category `women', exemplified in the popular
   operationalisation of intersectionality as `diversity among women'. We
   instead propose a margins-to-centre approach that centres the
   intersections of race, gender and other power structures. Second, we
   exemplify what this shift looks like in practice. We show how centring
   racially minoritised women and the intersecting structures that position
   them within political institutions transforms strategies to improve
   responsiveness to this intersectionally marginalised group.},

Abstract = {The nature of global economic interactions is undergoing profound
   changes. Rising concerns over the security and strategic implications of
   economic interdependence are leading to what is often defined as a
   `geoeconomic world order'. In framing this Special Issue, this article
   sets a common conceptual ground to assess whether, how and why the
   single European market is experiencing such a geoeconomic turn and how
   EU responses are shaping other international actors in the process. It
   develops a research agenda to examine (i) the systemic pressures pushing
   towards geoeconomic responses, (ii) the internal drivers and processes
   determining the nature of the EU's geoeconomic turn (what we term
   `shades of geopoliticisation') and (iii) the external consequences of
   the EU's embrace of geoeconomics. The analytical discussion is
   complemented by an overview of empirical trends, drawing examples from
   the various fields of market integration and European policy-making
   covered in the contributions to this Special Issue.},

Title = {Intersectional Motherhood and Candidate Evaluations in the United States},
Journal = {POLITICS \& GENDER},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 27},
Abstract = {In the United States, emphasizing their families and talking about
   parenthood can be a potent strategy for political candidates as voters
   use information about a candidate's family life to make assessments of
   the candidate's personal attributes and issue competencies. We
   nonetheless know little about how a candidate's race affects these
   assessments. We thus consider how Black women use and benefit from
   politicizing motherhood, and we argue that the unique intersectional
   identities of Black women shaped jointly by their race and gender can
   give Black women a stronger strategic advantage from highlighting
   motherhood compared to white women. Using both observational and
   experimental data, we apply this intersectional framework by examining
   motherhood messages. We identify the extent to which Black women rely on
   messages about motherhood and how voters respond. Our results show that
   Black women are just as likely to use motherhood messages relative to
   white women, and that Black women receive positive evaluations from
   voters from a message emphasizing motherhood. White and minority voters
   are equally likely to positively rate Black women who emphasize
   motherhood.},

Month = {2024 MAR 25},
Abstract = {This study draws together theories of women's substantive representation
   and research on politicians' knowledge of constituent preferences. We
   ask whether politicians are better at predicting their constituents'
   policy preferences when they share the same gender. In doing so, we
   contribute to knowledge about the mechanisms underlying substantive
   representation. Using original surveys of 3,750 Canadians and 867
   elected politicians, we test whether politicians correctly perceive
   gender gaps in their constituents' policy preferences and whether women
   politicians are better at correctly identifying the policy preferences
   of women constituents. Contrary to expectations from previous research,
   we do not find elected women to be better at predicting the preferences
   of women constituents. Instead, we find that all politicians -
   regardless of their gender - perform better when predicting women's
   policy preferences and worse when predicting men's preferences. The
   gender of the constituent matters more than the gender of the
   politician.},

Abstract = {Regulatory intermediaries-organizations that operate between regulators
   (public and private) and target groups-perform a range of important
   functions. While most previous research has focused on intermediaries
   that have been delegated official authority, in this paper we focus on
   unofficial and informal intermediary functions aiming to advance the
   governance of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) chemicals.
   Chemical pollution is a growing environmental and health concern,
   leading to both public and private regulatory initiatives. By studying a
   particular segment-paperboard food packaging in Sweden-the study
   generates insights into critical functions performed by unofficial
   intermediaries (Svenskt Vatten and ChemSec) in this regulatory regime,
   which extend and expand regulatory reach in various ways. The study also
   shows the importance of different types of intermediaries that interact
   in dynamic ways, and the role of material artifacts in processes of
   intermediation. These unofficial functions are arguably important for
   the functioning of complex, hybrid forms of governance, but they also
   prompt critical questions about the effectiveness, legitimacy, and role
   of intermediaries in generating needed transformative change.},

Abstract = {Employing a novel georeferenced household survey enriched with data on
   precipitation and temperature, this paper examines how rainfall
   variability affects individual labor supply in Uzbekistan, a highly
   traditional lower-middle-income country in Central Asia. The findings
   suggest that rainfall variability induces the reallocation of labor
   supply: (1) out of agriculture to unemployment, (2) from unemployment to
   business activities and irregular remunerated activities, and (3) from
   being out of labor force to unemployment. These effects differ in rural
   and urban areas and by gender. In addition, active women's involvement
   in the labor market and household decision-making mediates the impact of
   rainfall variability on employment choices, especially in rural areas.
   This implies that traditional gender roles may make households in
   developing countries more vulnerable to adverse consequences of climate
   change, while women's empowerment may mitigate such consequences.},

Abstract = {How does the closure of prisons impact local communities where the
   prison is sited? The paper compares three prison closures in northern
   and central Kazakhstan through field observations, interviews, and focus
   groups at the sites. We find that respondents unanimously opposed
   closure by appealing to the apparent good performance of the prison.
   Beyond the economic loss incurred by closure, respondents reported a
   loss of communal identity, as well as prestige connected to the presence
   of the military at the colony. The paper analyzes these responses by
   examining the logics by which the prisons came to be opened in the
   Soviet period as well as investigating how the relationship between
   punishment, economy, and society in Kazakhstan has changed since that
   time.},

Abstract = {The principle of conditionality has evolved in the European Union from a
   European foreign policy tool to an instrument of European governance.
   European conditionality developed as a hard mode of soft governance.
   This article describes the different forms and cases of using
   conditionality in European policy so far. Based on this analysis, it
   elaborates characteristics and patterns of European conditionality
   policy and tries to distinguish different types of conditionality. This
   article thus tries to conceptualise the principle, takes a view on the
   effect and development of the principle in the European Union and
   finally tries to develop a typology of European conditionality.},

Abstract = {By influencing beliefs about electoral quality, international election
   observation missions (EOMs) play an important role in shaping
   post-election contention. As the number and variety of international
   organizations (IOs) involved in election observation has grown, many
   elections host multiple missions and disagreement among them is common.
   This phenomenon of competing judgments is particularly prevalent in
   electoral authoritarian regimes, as leaders seek to invite `friendly'
   IOs to counteract possible criticism from more established EOMs. Drawing
   from research about the varying domestic credibility of EOMs and the
   demobilizing effects of disinformation, we argue that compared to
   unified criticism, competing judgments among EOMs increase uncertainty
   about electoral quality, which in turn dampens post-election contention.
   Using newly available data on EOM statements as reported in the
   international media, we show that competing judgments reduce
   post-election contention in a sample of 115 countries from 1990-2012. A
   survey experiment in Turkey solidifies the micro-foundations of our
   argument: individuals exposed to competing judgments have more positive
   perceptions of election quality and less support for post-election
   mobilization, compared to those receiving information only about EOM
   criticism. Our findings provide systematic evidence that governments
   holding flawed elections have incentives to invite multiple election
   observation missions to hedge against the political risks of criticism.},

Abstract = {In the early modern period, the Holy Roman Empire consisted of several
   hundred territories. The boundaries of these polities marked political
   claims to power but posed few obstacles to the everyday life of the
   population. Using the example of penal expulsion, this article aims to
   show this ambivalent role of territorial borders in the Empire. It
   attempts in particular to illuminate the possibilities of social
   reintegration that were available to exiles due to the considerable
   trans-territorial interconnectedness of society in the Empire.},

Abstract = {This article examines Spain's COVID-19 pandemic recovery from the
   perspective of politicisation as a form of politicalactivity. The main
   argument is that politicisation must be considered more broadly as a
   part of democratic politics, as distinct from the too narrow theoretical
   framework of European Union (EU) politicisation. The analysis builds on
   recent conceptual research into politicisation and asks: Has Spain's
   pandemic recovery become politicised and, if so, in what way did this
   politicisation occur and to what extent have politicising strategies
   been used? In Spain, politicalparties have not openly engaged in
   conflict about the country's membership of the EU, but they do have a
   clear tendency towards a deeply partisan and highly polarised approach
   to domestic politics, aggravated since the COVID-19 pandemic. The
   analysis focuses on opposition strategies during the period from the
   beginning of March 2020 to the end of December 2023. The main conclusion
   of the analysis is that politicising strategies were used by the
   opposition parties in contexts that gave them opportunities to exploit
   the situation in a novel way. On those occasions, it is possible to
   identify four different dimensions of politicisation. This illustrates
   that by attempting to utilise novel ways of acting politically,
   politicisation effectively becomes an intervention in the current state
   of affairs for politicalpurposes. This conclusion can provide a useful
   conceptual framework for future research into pandemic recovery in a
   comparative sense and also into the concept of politicisation within
   democratic politics in general.},

   {[}Anonymous], 17 The evolution of ``sexual orientation{''} as a concept has yet to be written. Its definitional status is strangely taken-for-granted in much writing in queer theory and sexuality, as being conceptually coextensive with individual human ``sexuality{''} as a central feature of subjectivity beginning in the late 19th Century. The most comprehensive histories of sexual orientation as a concept are presented along with attempts to better measure and understand it, and come from primarily from the discipline of psychology. A genealogy of contemporary sexual orientation as a concept associated with metrics would likely begin with the writing of Stephen Morin, Michael Shivley, and John DeCecco in the 1970s and 80s, and extend to Grzanka's recent research and that of Sari van Anders. See, John DeCecco and Michael G. Shively, ``From Sexual Identity to Sexual Relationships: A Contextual Shift,{''} Journal of Homosexuality 9, no. 2-3 (1984): 1-26; Michael G. Shively and John DeCecco, ``Components of Sexual Identity,{''} Journal of Homosexuality 3, no. 1 (Fall 1977): 41-48; Sari M. van Anders, ``Beyond Sexual Orientation: Integrating Gender/Sex and Diverse Sexualities via Sexual Configurations Theory,{''} Archives of Sexual Behavior 44, no. 5 (July 2015): 1177-1213, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-015-0490-8; Patrick R. Grzanka, ``Queer Survey Research and the Ontological Dimensions of Heterosexism,{''} Women's Studies Quarterly 44, no. 3/4 (Fall 2016): 131-49; Patrick R. Grzanka, Katharine H. Zeiders, and Joseph R. Miles, ``Beyond `Born This Way?' Reconsidering Sexual Orientation Beliefs and Attitudes.,{''} Journal of Counseling Psychology 63, no. 1 (2016): 67-75, https://doi.org/10.1037/cou0000124. However, this genealogy is speculative. The history of sexual orientation requires its own rigorous and independent analysis; such an inquiry could likely constitute a subfield within the history of sexuality..

   {[}Anonymous], 38 The co-deployment of multiple critical terms with variegated genealogies in this paragraph builds upon the theoretical apparatus that underlies and motivates this dissertation. My use of ``hail{''} is rooted primarily in Louis Althusser's formulation of ``interpellation{''} as the moment one recognizes oneself as a product of ideology in On the Reproduction of Capitalism: Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (London; New York: Verso, 2014), 190-196. However, unlike Althusser, who framed power as a negative operation performed upon the subject by agents of ``ISAs,{''} rather than both a negative and positive operation that produced new sorts of subjects, my usage of ``hail{''} is also more simply meant to denote an act of recognition by an actor in a particular mode of address or object (such as a diagram). Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe name the act of intentionally calling out to others in the mode that ONC does in its vision papers and calls for public comment an ``articulation.{''} See, Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics, 2nd ed (London; New York: Verso, 2001). When one recognizes themselves in a specific mode of address they are hailed - and acts of hailing impart ideologies, create subjects, bring out new constituencies, create new publics, form new polities, enact new stakeholders, and assist in materializing new realities. This is as true in health IT policy as in any other field of activity. This approach is also informed by Michael Warner's work, particularly in the opening pages of Publics and Counterpublics, where he writes that ``Publics...have become an almost natural feature of the social landscape, like pavement...Your attention is everywhere solicited by artifacts that say, before they say anything else, Hello, public!{''} (New York, NY: Zone Books, 2002), 7. This is the sort of hailing that ONC's diagram is doing, to an in-principle-limitless range of actors, whom the office (and I) call ``stakeholders.{''} My use of ``materialize{''} drawn chiefly from Michelle Murphy, who writes in Sick Building Syndrome and the Problem of Uncertainty, on the materialization of physical objects and objects of knowledge, that It is not so easy to materialize a new object...At stake in writing a history of the contested reality of chemical exposures is the historicity of what counts as real, of what did and did not matter. To do this, I have conveyed matter, not in terms of a prior thingness but rather in terms of the processes of history, concrete social and technical arrangements and the effects of power - hence my use of the verb materialize. (15) ONC's diagram works to materialize new knowledge-objects in the way that Murphy describes: tracing the ``concrete social and technical arrangements of power{''} so that actors can imagine new ones in a transformed health IT ecosystem. My definition of ``reality{''} comes from an assemblage of actor-network theorists such as Murphy, Annemarie Mol, Bruno Latour, and John Law. However, I am chiefly informed by John Law's approach in essays such as After Method, ``Notes on the Theory of the Actor-Network: Ordering, Strategy, and Heterogeneity,{''} and ``Seeing Like a Survey.{''} Reality is simply what actors, working together in networks, bring about and sustain: it is what they enact and materialize. See also, Boellstorff, ``For Whom the Ontology Turns.{''} As Law notes in After Method, these realities are vaguely constituted, are constantly changing and in flux. When technologies are involved, they need recalibration or what Andrew Pickering calls ``'tuning' in the sense of tuning a radio set or car engine...No one knows in advance the shape of future machines and what they will do, but we can track the process of establishing that shape,{''} by following the actions of both human and non-human actors in the network. See, John Law, ``Notes on the Theory of the Actor-Network: Ordering, Strategy, and Heterogeneity,{''} Systems Practice 5, no. 4 (April 10, 1992): 379-93; John Law, ``Seeing Like a Survey,{''} Cultural Sociology 3, no. 2 (July 1, 2009): 239-56; Andrew Pickering, The Mangle of Practice: Time, Agency, and Science (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1995),14-15. ONC's ecosystem envisions chaotic realities like these, that require constant tweaking, tuning, and tinkering: both in policy and local environments where technologies are used. Describing messy realities requires messy - if also exacting - theorization: theory that, along with the realities toward which it is aimed, also produces new realities..
