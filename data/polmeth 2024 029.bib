Abstract = {In a recent article in NPE, Rajesh Venugopal (2022. Can the
   anti-politics machine be dismantled? New political economy, 1-15)
   concluded that the anti-politics machine was still in operation. He
   argued that development planners held a cognitive divide between the
   realm of political dynamics - an unknowable terra incognita - and the
   realm of operational technical knowledge. This article revisits and
   expands that argument. It takes a particular kind of adaptive project as
   an analytical entry point, arguing that their focus on political
   practice reimagines the ontology of politics as a kind of expert m \&
   emacr;tis which is situated, relational and emergent. Such projects hold
   out hope that the anti-politics machine can be dismantled by displacing
   the cognitive frames of the development planner from the centre stage
   and emphasising political practice during implementation. However,
   shifting attention to implementation reveals other elements of the
   anti-politics machine's operation. Drawing on interviews with policy
   advocates, the article shows that the anti-politics machine does not
   simply work through the cognition of the planner: it also acts through
   bureaucratic resistance to political practice during project
   implementation, produced through operational, accountability and
   financing processes that shackle practice, particularly in spaces with
   heterogeneous interests and values.},

Abstract = {Making security has been Leviathan's home turf and its prime
   responsibility. Yet, while security states in advanced democracies share
   this uniform purpose, there is vast variation in how they legitimize and
   how they make security policies. First, the political authority of
   elected policy-makers is sometimes superseded by the epistemic authority
   of experts. Second, states make security, in some instances, by drawing
   on their own capacities, whereas in other fields they rely on rules to
   manage non-state actors. Based on this variation in authority
   foundations and policy instruments, we disentangle Leviathan into
   different types of (i) positive, (ii) managing, (iii) technocratic, and
   (iv) regulatory security states. Our typology helps better understand
   contemporary security policy-making; it advances regulatory governance
   theory by conceptualizing the relationship between expertise and rules
   in a complex and contested issue area; and it provides insights into the
   ``new economic security state{''} and the domestic underpinnings of
   weaponized interdependence.},

Abstract = {The article investigates the extent of political favouritism in the
   central financing of local governments in Hungary between 2015 and 2018.
   An investigation of various transfers and the role of both mayor and
   member of parliament (MP) in the granting of funds enabled me to map how
   grant schemes relate to pork-barrelling. The rewarding of core
   supporters is observable with regard to discretionary intergovernmental
   transfers, while the political alignment affects the distribution of EU
   funds; thus, these constitute the primary mechanisms for acknowledging
   and sharing credit with local leaders. When a grant scheme requires
   municipalities to file an application for funding, local governments in
   opposition receive fewer grants.},

Title = {Playing with the News on Reddit: The Politics Game on r/The\_Donald},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},

Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Research into online forms of far-right, alt-right, populist, and
   supremacist politics has raised questions about the extent to which
   social media enables or constitutes extremist affects and ideologies.
   Building on this research and through a case study of how a pro-Trump
   community on Reddit made sense of news events and sought to contest
   their representation, this paper explores the relationship between games
   and politics, arguing that digital platforms encourage people to
   apprehend, interpret, and contest political ideas and information as if
   engaged in a kind of videogame. We show how the group sought to
   manipulate platform affordances, waging a kind of Info War rooted in an
   understanding of politics as a pure space of conflict. We show how
   social media orients people to politics, phenomenologically, through the
   logics, structures and narratives of online games and argue that this
   affects not only online behaviors but more general apprehensions of
   politics.

   questions quant \& agrave; la mesure dans laquelle les r \& eacute;seaux
   sociaux favorisent ou forment des affects ou des id \& eacute;ologies

   utilise une \& eacute;tude de cas d'une communaut \& eacute; pro-Trump
   sur Reddit, de sa compr \& eacute;hension des \& eacute;v \&
   eacute;nements de l'actualit \& eacute; et de sa tentative de remise en
   question de leur repr \& eacute;sentation. Il s'int \& eacute;resse \&

   plateformes num \& eacute;riques nous encouragent \& agrave; appr \&
   eacute;hender, interpr \& eacute;ter et remettre en question les id \&
   eacute;es politiques et informations, comme si nous \& eacute;tions dans
   une sorte de jeu vid \& eacute;o. Nous montrons comment le groupe a tent
   \& eacute; de manipuler l'affordance des plateformes, en menant une
   sorte de guerre de l'information, ancr \& eacute;e dans la compr \&
   eacute;hension de la politique en tant que pur espace de conflit. Nous
   montrons comment les r \& eacute;seaux sociaux nous orientent dans nos
   opinions politiques, de fa \& ccedil;on ph \& eacute;nom \&
   eacute;nologique, par le biais des structures, logiques et r \&

   La investigaci \& oacute;n sobre las formas en l \& iacute;nea de las
   pol \& iacute;ticas de la extrema derecha y de la derecha alternativa,
   populistas y supremacistas ha planteado preguntas sobre hasta qu \&
   eacute; punto las redes sociales permiten o constituyen afectos e
   ideolog \& iacute;as extremistas. Sobre la base de esta investigaci \&
   oacute;n, y a trav \& eacute;s de un estudio de caso relativo a c \&
   oacute;mo una comunidad pro-Trump en Reddit dot \& oacute; de sentido a

   argumentando que las plataformas digitales alientan a las personas a
   captar, interpretar y disputar ideas e informaci \& oacute;n pol \&
   iacute;tica como si estuvieran involucradas en una especie de
   videojuego. Mostramos c \& oacute;mo este grupo intent \& oacute;
   manipular las posibilidades de la plataforma, librando una especie de
   guerra de la informaci \& oacute;n que estaba arraigada en una comprensi
   \& oacute;n de la pol \& iacute;tica como si fuera un espacio puro de
   conflicto. Tambi \& eacute;n, demostramos c \& oacute;mo las redes
   sociales orientan a las personas hacia la pol \& iacute;tica, fenomenol
   \& oacute;gicamente, a trav \& eacute;s de las l \& oacute;gicas,
   estructuras y narrativas de los juegos en l \& iacute;nea y argumentamos
   que esto afecta, no solo los comportamientos en l \& iacute;nea, sino

Abstract = {The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won consecutive parliamentary
   majorities in India's 2014 and 2019 elections, ushering in a period of
   single-party dominance that has replaced a quarter-century of coalition
   politics. This new era has been marked by a growing concentration of
   executive power, crackdowns on dissent, and rising Hindu
   majoritarianism. The roots of India's democratic backsliding predate the
   BJP's resurgence, but the trends have intensified in the past 10 years.
   While the party's disappointing performance in the 2024 elections
   suggests a possible corrective, legislative capture in India will not
   easily unravel: The BJP remains in a commanding political position and
   shows little inclination toward moderation; questions about electoral
   integrity abound; referee institutions are abdicating their authority;
   and constraints on civil society endure. Given India's outsize
   geopolitical importance, foreign pressure is unlikely to be decisive in
   reversing these trends.},

Abstract = {Hong Kong presents a test case of China's willingness to adapt Western
   liberal values of individual freedom and the rule of law in a corner of
   China. The Western model of governance, along with its common law system
   and capitalist economic system, has been permitted to operate side by
   side with the Chinese socialist system within the framework of Chinese
   sovereignty and the People's Republic of China's (PRC) political and
   legal system. The formation and implementation of the policy of `one
   country, two systems' (OCTS) entail Chinese law-makers' selective
   integration of international and Western rules of governance into the
   Hong Kong and China context to serve the interests of the PRC party
   regime. This article explores the approaches taken by the PRC to the
   governance of Hong Kong in light of the regime's political and economic
   goals and how the Western concept of rule of law and autonomy is
   perceived and substantiated in terms of the communist ideology. The
   author argues that the intrinsic value of OCTS lies in seeking
   complementarity and coexistence between the Western liberal norms of
   governance and Chinese communist ideology, and that this intrinsic value
   should be upheld and remain in full force to serve as a normative
   consensus between China and the West.},

   findings reveal that ethnicity plays a significant role in shaping
   electoral preferences, as Asian Americans exhibit coethnicity
   preferences, conditional on partisanship. Moreover, I uncover several
   factors that have been underexplored in the existing literature,
   including transnational ties, news consumption, and political
   preferences on foreign policies related to their home country. This
   article provides a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of Asian
   American identities by showing that the ethnic origin roots of Asian
   Americans can have significant influence on their political interests
   and candidate preferences.},

Abstract = {This article examines the programmatic evolution of social democratic
   parties in Italy, Portugal, and Spain, three countries in which the
   center-left has governed in the last decade. To do so, the article
   develops an analytical framework for mapping social and labor market
   policy reforms and assessing their liberalizing, regularizing, or
   recalibrating character. In explanatory terms, the article studies the
   coalitional politics behind social democratic reforms as being
   conditional upon the relationships between organized interests,
   electoral social blocs, and party system dynamics. The comparative
   analysis shows both commonalities and differences: the cases range from
   postindustrial recalibration (Italy) to inclusive egalitarianism
   (Spain), with Portugal taking a middling path, closer to that of Spain.
   Overall, in these countries a move away from both traditional ``social
   protectionism{''} and crisis-era internal devaluation has taken place,
   but it has taken different forms depending on country-specific
   coalitional dynamics within the left and trade union camps.},

Abstract = {Transitional justice largely ignores that majority of actors who, though
   not directly responsible for violence, are structurally implicated in
   systems of injustice that (re)produce violence. Their absence is
   incompatible with the normative goals of the `transformative justice'
   agenda, which include targeting the causes of (structural) violence, a
   project decidedly shaped by the presence of implicated subjects,
   especially in cases of historical injustice. This article engages a
   select group of implicated subjects - anti-racist white activists in the
   United States - to examine what their endeavours and struggles to reckon
   with their implication in the ongoing histories of racism and white
   supremacy can tell us about the boundaries of a transformative justice
   model. Drawing upon nine months of participant observation and 30
   in-depth interviews within predominantly white activist spaces in the
   Greater Boston area, I contend that viewing transitional justice from
   the lens of implicated subjects serves to trouble the field's
   transformative aspirations.},

Abstract = {Although plausible deniability is a definitional characteristic of
   covert actions, numerous Russian actions have been unveiled and
   attributed to Russia over the past decade. The reason for these frequent
   revelations can be explained by three factors: ignorance, indifference,
   and incompetence. Russian actions often display ignorance about the
   reactions they might elicit, indifference to global opinion if they are
   caught, and incompetence that allows foreign governments to unpeel the
   sometimes thin veneer of clandestinity that is supposed to cover Russian
   actions. Frequent revelations based on a combination of those factors
   have given Russia a reputation of aggressiveness in the international
   arena, while also limiting Russia's own actions, even in overt areas
   such as diplomacy and economic relations, because of that reputation.},

Abstract = {Welfare reforms in the 1990s, particularly the Personal Responsibility
   and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, were motivated by
   concerns over the long-term poor. We compare the experiences of newly
   poor women in 1990-1992, 2001-2003, and 2008-2010 and find that the size
   and sources of the income shocks generating new spells of poverty
   remained relatively stable. In dual-head families, the newly poor were
   most often pushed into poverty by a drop in spousal earnings; in
   single-mother families, the main cause was a drop in personal earnings.
   For single mothers in the latter two periods, we find that income from
   cash transfers after becoming poor was less than in the 1990-1992
   benchmark. As these transfers include welfare payments, the timing
   points to the impacts of the 1996 welfare reforms.},

Abstract = {This chapter investigates the impact of global migration on approaches
   towards electoral rights in Russia. Specifically, it focuses on the
   implications of the reactionary attitudes towards migration of labour
   and capital ('othering') for the legal regulation of elections and
   perceptions of electoral behaviour in Russia. The chapter addresses the
   existing gap in the legal and political science scholarship by applying

Abstract = {The Corona pandemic has led to the deepest economic slump since World
   War II. Economic crises in the past have often led to a change of
   direction in the development of capitalism. What are the consequences of
   the Corona crisis? How do experts and policy advisors articulate the
   desirable steps for economic recovery? This review essay takes stock of
   some 20 books published since 2020 on the topic of corona and the
   economy, in economics, critical social studies, political economy, and
   related disciplines. Even if many books avoid clear statements on the
   further development of our economic system, a common leitmotif can be
   identified. It is very clear that a less liberal economic system is
   expected in the near future. In any case, most of the analyses see the
   state as being significantly strengthened, as it will again intervene
   more strongly in the economy in the future, not only for social and
   economic stabilization after the pandemic but also in combating climate
   change. Whether this change will also translate into more social
   security and less inequality, however, remains unclear.},

Abstract = {Can citizens continue to participate in the politics of their home
   country after migrating to another country? Many examples exist of
   migrants engaging in their country of origin's political affairs, such
   as expatriate voting, forming political communities and hometown
   associations, donating money to political movements and politicians,
   advocating for migrants' rights, and other forms of political
   participation. However, it remains unclear why migrants are willing to
   continue exercising their `voice' after `exit', and what the main
   challenges and obstacles are for them to do so while abroad. In this
   chapter, we analyse the patterns of civic and political engagement among
   Russian migrants who fled their home country following the invasion of
   Ukraine in February 2022. Drawing on scholarship in migration studies,
   we view exit and voice not as mutually exclusive but as mutually
   reinforcing alternatives. We argue that the way migrants connect with
   their homeland, and particularly the connections they have with their
   employers, plays a crucial role in mobilizing and demobilizing them. The
   incentives provided by employers may force migrants to damp their
   propensity to engage in political activities. To support our argument,
   we rely on an original survey conducted in March-April and September
   2022, as well as semi-structured, in-depth interviews conducted in
   Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, and Turkiye.},

Abstract = {The way in which neurotechnology interferes with the human mind by
   enabling reverse inferences of mental states and alterations of mental
   processes, is a source of significant concern. Both human rights
   scholars and international and regional human rights institutions are
   actively examining which human rights safeguards are needed to address
   these concerns and protect the human mind. Central to this exploration
   is the question of how human rights law should formally establish these
   safeguards: through the introduction of neurorights as new stand-alone
   human rights, or by deriving neurorights form existing rights? This
   article seeks to contrast arguments in favour and against both
   strategies, to inform a substantiated choice for the preferable option.
   To this end, the article will first outline the origins of the
   neurorights debate. Subsequently, it will elaborate on the two
   identified approaches to establishing neurorights. Thereafter, both
   approaches will be assessed on their merits, focussing on the general
   criteria of `need' and `feasibility'. Based on this evaluation, the
   article identifies the Derivation Approach as the preferable path
   forward. The need for new, stand-alone rights is insufficiently
   established, whereas deriving neurorights from existing rights provides
   clearer and more coherent safeguards, and encounters fewer political
   challenges.},

Abstract = {The contestation of multilateralism and international norms is a
   constitutive element of the new neopatriot far right. On a global scale,
   this adopts sovereigntist, nationalist, and antiglobalist perspectives,
   which in many cases are expressed through populist discourses that
   establish an antagonism between the ``people{''} and elites (global,
   foreign, or even national elites associated with foreign interests). In
   the cases of Jair Bolsonaro and Javier Milei, prominent representatives
   of the new Latin American neopatriot far right, the contestation extends
   to regional organizations (particularly those that emerged during the
   2003-15 ``pink tide{''}), (re) politicizing consensus and norms from a
   sovereigntist reaffirmation opposed to cooperation and integration with
   neighbors. If Latin American progressive populisms saw in regional
   integration under the ideal of a ``Patria Grande{''} ({''}Great
   Fatherland{''}) a strategy to build national projects and a united
   ``people{''} facing engagement between national oligarchies and
   imperialism, the new far-right is reversing this antagonism in a
   sovereigntist way to contest regionalism and regional integration.},

Abstract = {Aware of the power of platform firms and the risks of the platform
   economy, governments are reconsidering the dominant laissez faire
   approach in favour of strategies that regulate the power of platform
   firms. transnational dynamics play an important role in shaping emerging
   national regimes, but we argue that governments are also influenced by
   three factors that operate primarily at domestic level: the agency of
   platform firms, the impact of first-mover US platforms, and domestic
   politics. We illustrate our approach through an analysis of the
   trajectories and regulatory measures of four economies: the US, the EU,
   China, and India. As governance efforts expand to emerging technologies
   such as AI, our analysis presages broader changes to the structure of
   what was, with a few important exceptions, a relatively borderless
   global online economy.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the ethnic penalty by focusing on the racialization
   of labor market outcomes beyond the migrant penalty. An illegitimate
   statistical or taste-based discrimination can be revealed specifically
   by distinguishing migrants into ethnic groups. Accordingly, ethnic
   penalty based on five different ethnic groups was estimated through the
   difference in employment and job quality with respect to natives. The
   analysis was conducted at the country and European average levels using
   16 European countries under a framework of ethnic penalty processes in
   the labor market. According to the analysis, Eastern Europeans were the
   most prominent ethnicity regarding higher employment across the 16
   countries, although they were mostly posited in unskilled jobs. Migrants
   from the Middle East and North Africa were shown to be subject to a
   double penalty in both measures, and the penalty tendency was much
   clearer for females. Asians and South Americans showed the least
   penalty, while sub-Saharan Africans were revealed to hold an in-between
   position.},

Abstract = {Do recent increases in women's representation around the world have
   implications for international relations? We argue that greater
   representation of women in legislatures increases the likelihood of
   human rights treaty ratification for two reasons. First, given their
   shared gendered experiences of exclusion and discrimination, women
   legislators will advocate on behalf of marginalized groups on an
   international scale as transnational surrogate representatives. Second,
   women legislators may be more inclined to prioritize the ratification of
   human rights treaties because these treaties align with their domestic
   policy preferences, which aim to support marginalized groups. We contend
   that, in countries where ratification depends upon legislative approval,
   legislatures are more likely to ratify human rights treaties as women's
   presence increases. Using an original dataset of 201 multilateral
   treaties, we find that countries become more likely to ratify human
   rights treaties as levels of women's legislative representation
   increase.},

   province in the Andalusian law, with special attention to the exercise
   of delegated competence as a provincial competence. Methodology:
   Analysis of norms, jurisprudence and doctrine. Results: Study of the
   delegation of municipal powers in the province in the Andalusian Law,
   with special attention to the exercise of the delegated power as own
   provincial competence; some key aspects of the figure are also
   addressed. Conclusions: The main conclusion of this work is that the
   delegated exercise of municipal competence its own provincial competence
   is a manifestation of the integration of municipalities and provinces
   into a single political community (preamble to the Law of Local Autonomy
   of Andalusia) and has specific consequences.},

Title = {Analysing legislatures using a feminist institutionalist lens},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND GENDER},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 19},
Abstract = {This is an exciting time in the development of the gendered study of
   legislatures, both theoretically and empirically. Over the last decade,
   we have seen innovative work employing new theoretical approaches, as
   well as a host of empirical studies in both the Global North and South.
   As a contribution, this state-of-the-art article brings together two
   elements that form a key part of this recent work: an important
   theoretical approach, feminist institutionalism (FI); and an important
   empirical case, the European Parliament (EP), which has been uniquely
   systematically and innovatively explored over a sustained period. The
   article explores how both elements can inform the other and shows how
   bringing them together adds to our understanding through the development
   and implementation of an analytical framework to structure the gendered
   analysis of legislatures, before considering how these insights might
   inform future research agendas in FI.},

Abstract = {The political landscape of Italy experienced a seismic shift in the
   September 2022 elections, marking a watershed moment. Giorgia Meloni,
   the leader of the populist radical right party (PRRP) Brothers of Italy,
   was elected as Italy's head of government. This event highlighted a
   significant development in the country's gender politics, reflecting the
   ascent of PRRPs across Europe, marked by their reactionary politics,
   emphasis on traditional values and staunch opposition to gender
   equality. This study focuses on the dynamics between PRRPs (Brothers of
   Italy and the League) and the anti-gender movement in Italy. Through a
   qualitative content analysis of the primary sources of political parties
   and movements, the research explores their symbiotic relationship, the
   linkage and adjustment mechanisms employed by both actors, and the
   political outcomes of their interactions, offering insights into the
   mobilization of anti-gender actors and their alliance with PRRPs. It
   contributes to understanding how the organized opposition to gender
   equality is mainstreamed within political spheres, especially in
   contexts where right-wing populists hold power.},

Abstract = {International tribunals are pulled between a commitment to judicial
   autonomy and the need to manage their members' political expectations,
   lest these rein in the tribunal's power. We argue that when the formal
   design of international institutions leaves them exposed to political
   control, institutional actors can respond by self-imposing constraints
   to protect themselves from excessive oversight. We examine this
   phenomenon in the context of the World Trade Organization's (WTO)
   Appellate Body (AB), touted until recently as one of the most successful
   international tribunals in existence. We argue that the early insistence
   on collegiality and consensus opinions among WTO AB members had the
   effect of (i) deflecting political blame and (ii) providing cover for
   adjudicators who did not dissent when governments might have wished them
   to. As the informal norm of consensus opinion was weakened, political
   control by WTO members grew stronger, culminating in the United States's
   move to paralyze the AB. Weaker actors can thus improve their position
   under formal rules, yet this requires a strong commitment to a set of
   informal norms, which comes with its own challenges.},

Abstract = {This study examines racial discrimination faced by Black immigrants in
   the US, focusing on its impacts on well-being, social integration, and
   intergroup relations. It highlights a gap in understanding African
   immigrants' discrimination experiences despite documented hate crimes.
   The research aims to understand how Nigerian immigrants are affected by
   integration into US society. Using a mixed methodology with surveys and
   interviews, the study reveals varied correlations between integration
   factors and discrimination experiences. It provides nuanced insights
   into how integration, national identity, and social networks influence
   Nigerian immigrants' relationships and encounters with discrimination in
   the US, contributing valuable perspectives on integration-discrimination
   dynamics.},

Title = {Cucktales: Race, Sex, and Enjoyment in the Reactionary Memescape},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},

Month = {JUN 21},
Abstract = {This article makes a critical contribution to the study of digital
   reactionary movements by tracing the resonant circulation of ``the
   cuck{''} memes across various levels of racialized and gendered
   subjectivity. It argues that the cuck meme resonates through composing
   an affective narrative of deferred and stolen enjoyment at the
   intersection of personal, social, and international politics. It follows
   the meme's digital movements across pornographic anxieties around the
   sexual prowess of the Black other (the personal), the Gamergate events
   of 2014 and its politics of geek masculine injury (the social), and the
   perceived threat of immigration to the enjoyment-space designated as the
   nation (the international). Throughout, the paper makes three
   contributions. First, it theorizes the structuring role played by
   enjoyment as a political factor in historically shaping political
   subjectivity. Second, it shows how this political factor animates the
   transnational politics of contemporary reactionary movements and how
   they affectively and discursively perceive their various political
   resentments through narratives of enjoyment. Third, it demonstrates how
   memes as specific technical-aesthetic products allow the common
   resonance and articulation of these various resentments to shape a site
   of rectification for an enjoyment that is felt to be lost.
   Cet article offre une contribution essentielle \& agrave; l'\&
   eacute;tude des mouvements r \& eacute;actionnaires num \& eacute;riques
   en retra \& ccedil;ant la circulation \& eacute;vocatrice du m \&
   egrave;me << the cuck >> (cocu, en anglais) \& agrave; travers diff \&
   eacute;rents niveaux de subjectivit \& eacute; racialis \& eacute;e et
   genr \& eacute;e. Il affirme que le m \& egrave;me du cocu trouve un \&
   eacute;cho en cr \& eacute;ant une histoire affective de plaisir vol \&
   eacute; et diff \& eacute;r \& eacute;, \& agrave; l'intersection de la
   politique personnelle, sociale et internationale. Il retrace la
   navigation num \& eacute;rique du m \& egrave;me entre les anxi \&
   eacute;t \& eacute;s pornographiques vis-\& agrave;-vis des prouesses
   sexuelles de l'autre noir (le personnel), les \& eacute;v \&
   eacute;nements du Gamergate de 2014 et sa dimension politique de
   blessure masculine geek (le social), et la menace per \& ccedil;ue de
   l'immigration pour l'espace de plaisir associ \& eacute; \& agrave; la
   nation (l'international). Ce faisant, l'article offre trois
   contributions. D'abord, il th \& eacute;orise le r \& ocirc;le
   structurant du plaisir en tant que facteur politique qui a
   historiquement fa \& ccedil;onn \& eacute; la subjectivit \& eacute;
   politique. Ensuite, il montre comment ce facteur politique anime la
   politique transnationale des mouvements r \& eacute;actionnaires
   contemporains et comment ils per \& ccedil;oivent, sur le plan affectif
   et discursif, leurs divers ressentiments politiques par le biais de r \&
   eacute;cits relatifs au plaisir. Enfin, il d \& eacute;montre comment
   les m \& egrave;mes, en tant que produits technico-esth \& eacute;tiques
   sp \& eacute;cifiques, font \& eacute;cho et articulent ces divers
   ressentiments aupr \& egrave;s du plus grand nombre, afin de construire
   un lieu de rectification o \& ugrave; peut s'\& eacute;panouir un
   plaisir qu'on a le sentiment d'avoir perdu.
   Este art \& iacute;culo realiza una contribuci \& oacute;n cr \&
   iacute;tica al estudio de los movimientos reaccionarios digitales ya que
   analiza la significativa circulaci \& oacute;n que tuvo el meme << el
   cornudo >> a trav \& eacute;s de varios niveles de subjetividad
   racializada y de g \& eacute;nero. El art \& iacute;culo argumenta que
   el meme << el cornudo >> tuvo repercusi \& oacute;n a trav \& eacute;s
   de la composici \& oacute;n de una narrativa afectiva de disfrute
   diferido y robado en la intersecci \& oacute;n de la pol \& iacute;tica
   personal, social e internacional. El art \& iacute;culo sigue los
   movimientos digitales del meme a trav \& eacute;s de las ansiedades
   pornogr \& aacute;ficas en torno a la destreza sexual de un otro negro
   (lo personal), los eventos del Gamergate de 2014 y su pol \& iacute;tica
   de provocar un da \& ntilde;o a los << frikis >> masculinos (lo social),
   y la amenaza percibida que supone la inmigraci \& oacute;n al espacio de
   disfrute designado como la naci \& oacute;n (lo internacional). El art
   \& iacute;culo, en toda su extensi \& oacute;n, realiza tres
   contribuciones. En primer lugar, teoriza sobre el papel estructurador
   que desempe \& ntilde;a el disfrute como un factor pol \& iacute;tico
   dentro de la configuraci \& oacute;n hist \& oacute;rica de la
   subjetividad pol \& iacute;tica. En segundo lugar, demuestra c \&
   oacute;mo este factor pol \& iacute;tico anima la pol \& iacute;tica
   transnacional de los movimientos reaccionarios contempor \& aacute;neos
   y c \& oacute;mo estos perciben, afectiva y discursivamente, sus
   diversos resentimientos pol \& iacute;ticos a trav \& eacute;s de
   narrativas de disfrute. En tercer lugar, demuestra c \& oacute;mo los
   memes, como productos t \& eacute;cnico-est \& eacute;ticos espec \&
   iacute;ficos, permiten que la repercusi \& oacute;n y la articulaci \&
   oacute;n comunes de estos diversos resentimientos den forma a un sitio
   de rectificaci \& oacute;n para un disfrute que se siente perdido.},

Abstract = {The growing literature on public opinion toward foreign direct
   investment (FDI) focuses primarily on the FDI-related job prospects of
   individuals. However, different types of FDI have varying economic and
   environmental impacts; we argue that individuals consider the trade-offs
   between these effects when forming attitudes about FDI. Utilizing a
   province-level dataset of recent FDI projects (categorized by their
   level of pollution and job creation) matched with public opinion data in
   seven Latin American countries, we find that exposure to investment that
   creates larger numbers of jobs improves attitudes toward FDI, regardless
   of environmental impact. However, environmental impact is a significant
   component of how some individuals form perspectives about FDI:
   respondents that prioritize the environment have more positive attitudes
   toward FDI when they are exposed to a higher share of FDI with
   relatively less environmental impact. Among all respondents, exposure to
   more economically beneficial FDI has a stronger positive impact when a
   higher percentage of the FDI is in lower-polluting industries.},

Abstract = {The European Union and other advanced economies are turning to mandatory
   due diligence regulation to address environmental and human rights risks
   in their global supply chains. This shift is accompanied by calls for
   `smart regulation' that combines public legislation with private
   governance instruments and new supporting measures in the producer
   countries of the Global South. We study the smart regulation agenda in
   the case of the European Union Deforestation Regulation. We reveal how
   its progressive rhetoric masks a conservative undertone as business
   actors and their civil society partners aim to safeguard their vested
   interests in the age of public supply chain regulation. However, by
   tracing their lobbying efforts throughout the policy formulation
   process, we show how this does not imply en bloc support for voluntary,
   softer forms of regulation. Moreover, these actors exhibit varying
   motivations and preferences for involving Southern actors in such a mix.
   Consequently, rather than forming a cohesive policy coalition, their
   preferences span from conservative to progressive, resulting in new
   alliances and divisions in this time of regulatory change. By untangling
   the complexities of `smart mix politics', this article advances critical
   research into the evolving role, positioning, and influence of business
   actors in global supply chain governance.},

Abstract = {(infinity)Reconciliation has emerged as one of the key goals of
   transitional justice and a favoured policy approach to address the
   racism, inequality and historical injustices experienced by Indigenous
   peoples in settler-colonial states. This article focuses on Australian
   reconciliation and argues that it has failed to critically engage with
   whiteness, limiting the potential of reconciliation to address the root
   causes of these issues. Drawing on critical whiteness studies and Aileen
   Moreton-Robinson's concept of patriarchal white sovereignty, the article
   analyses the federal government's push for constitutional recognition
   and demonstrates why reconciliation perpetuates the dispossession of
   Indigenous lands. The article also engages Michael Rothberg's figure of
   the implicated subject to complicate the concept of whiteness and
   overcome the Indigenous/settler or victim/perpetrator binary. This
   article contributes to the field of transitional justice by advocating
   for a more explicit and critical examination of whiteness to advance
   justice in settler colonial contexts.},

Abstract = {When Jimmy Carter became the U.S. president in January 1977, the United
   States and Oman did not have any formal security arrangements, apart
   from occasional landings of U.S. military aircraft on Oman's Masirah
   Island. Although Oman's leader, Sultan Qaboos bin Said, hoped to
   establish closer security ties with the United States, the Carter
   administration chose to continue President Richard Nixon's policy of
   relying on the ``twin pillars{''} of Iran and Saudi Arabia to reinforce
   Western security in the Persian/Arabian Gulf region. Oman remained
   mostly a strategic afterthought until a series of crises unfolded in the
   greater Middle East: a Communist coup in Afghanistan in April 1978, the
   fall of the Shah of Iran in January 1979, and a war between Marxist
   South Yemen and North Yemen shortly thereafter. In November 1979,
   Iranian terrorists backed by the Islamic regime stormed the U.S. embassy
   in Tehran and seized dozens of hostages. This was followed a month later
   by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. With the fall of the Shah and the
   collapse of the ``twin pillars{''} policy, the Carter administration
   began a sustained effort to create a Rapid Deployment Force for the
   Middle East and to gain access to Oman's strategic military facilities.
   After several months of arduous negotiations, Carter and his team were
   able to conclude a Facilities Access Agreement with Oman in June 1980, a
   transformative process that gave Washington the ability to insert U.S.
   military personnel into the Gulf and Indian Ocean on a contingency
   basis. The Carter administration's effort stands as a significant
   achievement, converting Oman into the most reliable U.S. ally in the
   Gulf region in the 1980s.},

   in Spain after two decades of Law 16/2003 has been in force.
   Methodology: The usual methodology used in the legal sciences has been
   employed, i.e. a study of legislation, doctrine, and jurisprudence.
   Results: The first part of the study identifies various signs of
   weakness in the degree of effective cohesion of the National Health
   System during the period prior to the pandemic crisis (2004-2019). The
   second part of the paper analyses the experience of the pandemic from
   the point of view of health cohesion. Conclusions: A circumstance has
   been overlooked that is very conducive to making significant corrections
   in this area. For this reason, some proposals are put forward to reverse
   the situation.},

Title = {Animacy and the Agency of Spiritual Beings in Pluriversal Societies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The concept of agency has long been a focal point of research in the
   social sciences. While traditional discussions primarily centered on
   human agency, recent scholarship has increasingly turned its attention
   to agency beyond the human realm. This paper introduces a framework for
   comprehending the agency of spiritual beings within complex pluriversal
   sociopolitical systems. It contends that exploring the agency of
   spiritual beings challenges established binary distinctions and
   acknowledges their inherent complexities. Drawing from a relational
   understanding of animacy, this framework reveals that the agency of
   spiritual beings cannot be simply equated with gods or fixed
   other-than-human agencies. Instead, it enriches our understanding of
   agency by highlighting how diverse agencies shape and influence social
   interactions. The paper compares Jane Bennett's ``thing power{''} and
   social assemblages to the Andean concepts of camaq (creating animating
   force) and Ajayu (spirit). By doing so, it uncovers both tensions and
   connections between these approaches, underscoring the need for
   pluriversal methodologies in analyzing pluriversal societies. In
   conclusion, the paper reflects on the implications of re-enchantment
   through animacy and its potential to provide fresh insights into
   understanding international phenomena.
   Le concept d'agence est depuis longtemps central dans la recherche en
   sciences sociales. Bien que, traditionnellement, les d \& eacute;bats se
   concentrent sur l'agence humaine, les travaux de recherche r \&
   eacute;cents s'int \& eacute;ressent de plus en plus aux autres types
   d'agence. Cet article pr \& eacute;sente un cadre pour appr \&
   eacute;hender l'agence des \& ecirc;tres spirituels au sein de syst \&
   egrave;mes sociopolitiques pluriversels complexes. Il affirme que
   l'examen de l'agence des \& ecirc;tres spirituels remet en question les
   distinctions binaires \& eacute;tablies et reconna \& icirc;t leur
   complexit \& eacute; inh \& eacute;rente. En se fondant sur une
   perception relationnelle de l'anim \& eacute;it \& eacute;, ce cadre r
   \& eacute;v \& egrave;le que l'agence des \& ecirc;tres spirituels ne se
   r \& eacute;sume pas \& agrave; des dieux ou des agences non humaines
   fixes. Il enrichit plut \& ocirc;t nos connaissances sur l'agence en
   soulignant comment diff \& eacute;rentes agences fa \& ccedil;onnent et
   influencent les interactions sociales. L'article compare le <<
   pouvoir-chose >> et les agencements sociaux de Jane Bennett aux concepts
   andins de camaq (force de cr \& eacute;ation et d'animation) et d'Ajayu
   (esprit). Ce faisant, il r \& eacute;v \& egrave;le \& agrave; la fois
   les tensions et les liens entre ces approches, en soulignant la n \&
   eacute;cessit \& eacute; de m \& eacute;thodologies pluriverselles dans
   l'analyse des soci \& eacute;t \& eacute;s pluriverselles. Pour
   conclure, l'article r \& eacute;fl \& eacute;chit aux implications du r
   \& eacute;enchantement par l'anim \& eacute;it \& eacute; et aux
   nouveaux renseignements qu'elle pourrait nous apporter pour comprendre
   les ph \& eacute;nom \& egrave;nes internationaux.
   Hace mucho tiempo que el concepto de agencia es uno de los puntos
   principales dentro de la investigaci \& oacute;n en el campo de las
   ciencias sociales. Mientras que los debates tradicionales sol \&
   iacute;an centrarse, principalmente, en la agencia humana, los estudios
   recientes han prestado cada vez m \& aacute;s atenci \& oacute;n a la
   agencia que tiene lugar m \& aacute;s all \& aacute; del \& aacute;mbito
   humano. Este art \& iacute;culo presenta un marco de trabajo que nos
   ayuda a comprender la agencia de los seres espirituales dentro de
   sistemas sociopol \& iacute;ticos pluriversales complejos. El art \&
   iacute;culo argumenta que el estudio de la agencia de los seres
   espirituales desaf \& iacute;a las distinciones binarias establecidas y
   reconoce sus complejidades inherentes. Este marco de trabajo consigue
   revelar, a partir de una comprensi \& oacute;n relacional de la
   animicidad, que la agencia de los seres espirituales no puede ser
   simplemente equiparada con dioses o con agencias fijas de naturaleza no
   humana. Por el contrario, enriquece nuestra comprensi \& oacute;n de la
   agencia al resaltar c \& oacute;mo las diversas agencias dan forma e
   influyen en las interacciones sociales. El art \& iacute;culo compara el
   concepto de ``thing power (poder de las cosas){''} de Jane Bennett y los
   ensamblajes sociales con los conceptos andinos de camaq (creaci \&
   oacute;n de fuerza animadora) y Ajayu (esp \& iacute;ritu). Al hacer
   esto, el art \& iacute;culo pone al descubierto tanto las tensiones como
   las conexiones existentes entre estos enfoques, subrayando la necesidad
   de metodolog \& iacute;as pluriversales en el an \& aacute;lisis de las
   sociedades pluriversales. En conclusi \& oacute;n, el art \& iacute;culo
   reflexiona sobre las implicaciones del reencantamiento a trav \&
   eacute;s de la animicidad y de su potencial para proporcionar nuevas
   perspectivas en la comprensi \& oacute;n de los fen \& oacute;menos
   internacionales.},

Abstract = {Disagreements are mounting between elite opponents of abortion with
   regard to constitutional interpretation. A rival interpretive method to
   originalism, common good constitutionalism holds that judges must invoke
   their own moral views when deciding legal questions, ushering the United
   States toward a ``postliberal{''} future. Increasingly attractive to
   right-wing politicians in the US and Europe, postliberalism is a far cry
   from conservatives' familiar refrain that reviving the framers' wisdom
   will restore our polity's health. Unlike originalists, postliberals
   believe individual autonomy is a debased notion of human freedom because
   it seeks to expand rights instead of promoting substantive and common
   human goods. Feminists' justified distrust of the liberal state to
   secure safety, freedom, and access for all who can become pregnant
   sometimes manifests in similar sentiments. Yet, precisely in light of
   past and ongoing reproductive harms, intersectional feminists require a
   firm notion of individual agency as a moral good and a proper
   desideratum of government - especially in the wake of Dobbs. Without an
   affirmation of consent as the root of ethical care and community,
   feminist critiques of individual rights come perilously close to
   facilitating the oppressive logic of postliberalism, which
   unapologetically subordinates individuals to hierarchical
   collectivities.},

Abstract = {In 2021, the Chilean Convention became the first constitution-making
   body with gender parity. However, the draft - which reflected many
   gender-related norms - was rejected by 61.89 per cent of voters in the
   exit plebiscite of 2022. In this article, we argue that although parity
   constitutionalism has promise and, in the Chilean case, was linked to
   gender-related outcomes in the constitutional text, parity's promise may
   fail to materialize. We thus caution against a naive view of parity
   constitutionalism as one of the key legacies of the 2020-22 Chilean
   constitution-making process.},

Abstract = {There has been much recent debate over whether the European Union is or
   should be a `militant democratic' actor in order to respond to
   democratic backsliding in EU member states. This article argues that the
   EU is a militant democracy in a specific and limited sense, but that
   this may be normatively undesirable from a democratic perspective. I
   first develop a definition of militant democracy that focuses on the
   militant democratic paradox. I argue that the strongest justifications
   for militant democracy require that two conditions are met: an
   `existential threat condition' and a `necessity condition'. Next, I
   analyse four ways in which the European Union has been said to be
   empowered to act in a militant democratic fashion to combat democratic
   backsliding in EU member states. I show how some, though not all, of
   these warrant the label `militant democracy'. Moving from the
   descriptive to the normative analysis, I then consider whether the
   necessity condition can ever be met since there is always the
   possibility of non-militant responses through forms of EU
   disintegration. If we accept this argument, EU actors should prioritize
   robust non-militant measures where possible while pro-democratic member
   states should disassociate from frankly autocratic member states where
   non-militant measures fail.},

Abstract = {``Democratic careening{''} aptly captures Poland's recent oscillation
   between liberal democracy, illiberalism, and efforts toward the recovery
   of liberal democratic norms. In contrast to the recent experience of
   Hungary, Poland's hard right governing party was unable to amend the
   nation's constitution as it attempted to consolidate power, so it relied
   on ordinary legislation and changes of personnel in the judiciary and
   other state institutions. This analysis shows how Poland's complex
   constitutional framework, its elections, and the contentious politics of
   resistance contributed to the nation's democratic resilience. I also
   reflect on the challenges faced by Poland's new government in undoing
   illiberal changes while avoiding legal and political instability,
   highlighting the broader implications of this case for democratic theory
   and the study of illiberalism.},

Abstract = {The article demonstrates an impressive shift from Russian to Ukrainian
   in war-time Ukraine. I rely on nationwide survey data from before and
   after February 2022 to analyze the scale and structure of the recent
   change in patterns of language use. I demonstrate not only an impressive
   shift across the practices but also a larger scale of change in public
   communication than in private use. Next, I examine responses to a small
   online survey and focus group discussions in different parts of Ukraine
   for detailed accounts of different categories of people's patterns of
   language use in various practices and explanations of the reasons for
   change - or continuity - in those patterns. I demonstrate a new
   phenomenon of the predominant reliance on Ukrainian at work and in other
   public communication by many people who used to speak predominantly
   Russian and still keep it as the main language of family use.},

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, the literature on norm diffusion in the
   post-Soviet space has grown dramatically. Increasingly, scholars have
   stressed the role of geopolitical competition between powerful
   international actors, notably Russia and the European Union (EU), in
   achieving and/or resisting liberal-democratic reform in the region. This
   article contributes to this recent research by adding a corrective to
   the literature, exploring the agency of local rather than external
   actors in the contestation of global gender equality norms through the
   high-value cases of Armenia and Georgia. By uncovering taken-for-granted
   gendered power dimensions in local norm contestation - a subject barely
   addressed in the norm diffusion literature - the article offers an
   explanation for the persistence of non-democratic trends in the
   post-Soviet space as a whole. Specifically, the article examines
   populist political masculinities contesting EU gender equality policies
   and related norms concerning violence against women and lesbian, gay,
   bisexual, and trans (LGBT) rights, arguing that in Armenia and Georgia,
   it is local populist actors, using taken-for-granted patriarchal and
   heterosexual discourses to reclaim local masculinities and their
   political legitimacy, who represent a major challenge to gender equality
   norms.},

Abstract = {We provide an overview of what has happened for women over the past 50
   years as they worked to break through professional barriers in
   economics, policy, and institutional leadership. We chart the progress
   of women in higher education at the college level and beyond and then
   examine women's representation at the upper levels of academia,
   government, law, medicine, and management. We begin our description of
   trends in 1972, when Title IX was enacted to prohibit sex-based
   discrimination in federally funded educational programs. The data paint
   a picture of considerable progress but also persistent inequities. We
   then go on to consider possible explanations for the continuing gender
   differences and some of the empirical evidence on the factors
   identified.},

   {[}Anonymous], 85 Nixon's decision to prioritize the Peacemaker theme over the economy through the final months of the campaign occurred in the summer of 1972. It is the case that the Peacemaker theme was a key feature of 1971 preparations of the ``Above the Battle{''} posture. But the intention behind the ``Above the Battle{''} posture was to allow Nixon to decide mid-summer what themes and issues to emphasize at the convention and the final months of the campaign. Nixon's choice to prioritize foreign policy to avoid economic issues and partisan domestic issues deviated somewhat from the initial plan. As Charles Colson explained in November 1971: The transition next summer should be as gradual as possible. Obviously, the political fat will be in the fire after the Republican Convention at which point the President's rhetoric shifts to the great promise which the future holds for America in terms of peace in the world, a strong and competitive economy, and a government responsive to the needs of the American people (whatever our key domestic thrust is--the value added tax and school proposal, welfare reform or whatever). It is nearly impossible to draw a projected Presidential campaign strategy today for the period of September and October 1972. If all goes well and we are riding high, the President must remain very Presidential, self-assured and above the battle..

Abstract = {In this article, I draw on the work of radical feminist legal scholars,
   who have argued for using the terminology of torture in international
   law as a means to take intimate partner violence (IPV) seriously and to
   recognize the harm of normalized violence. I explore lived experiences
   of IPV based on my feminist activist research, which has included
   co-moderating online support groups and conducting follow-up interviews
   with women who have been subjected to coercive control. I examine in
   detail the similarities between torture and IPV in terms of the
   purposiveness, severity, and effects of violence, and show how these
   were concretized in the lives of research participants. This research
   took place in Finland, which has been referred to as the ``Nordic
   paradox,{''} as IPV is both common and normalized within Finnish culture
   and society and the harm of private violence is generally dismissed. I
   conclude that drawing these parallels could serve as a means to raise
   awareness of the stakes of abusive relationships and validate targets'
   experiences of abuse. Moreover, focusing research on experiences of
   violence in a Nordic country can expand our understanding of
   gender-based violence in the context of feminist international
   relations.},

Abstract = {National Socialism/White Power (NS/WP) is a rhizomatic constellation of
   groupuscules that praise `direct action' and violence against the
   `anti-Russian' regime. It enjoys online affordances, having chosen
   Telegram as the safest alternative to mainstream social media. Frequency
   and co-occurrence network analysis of the Oderint, Dum Metuant channel's
   discourse revealed the movement's preoccupation with ideological matters
   and practical instructions for adherents on how to secure
   communications, produce explosives, and conduct terror attacks. In the
   context of violence escalation and an ideological vacuum, the skills and
   distinct ideological profile of NS/WP can make it a viable actor amongst
   the Russian nationalist youth.},

Abstract = {To effectively protect the human right to health, the global
   accountability gap for pharmaceutical companies regarding access to
   medicines must be addressed. Pharmaceutical companies have no formal
   obligations under human rights law; however, they do have
   responsibilities, and some companies (directly or indirectly) undermine
   the right to health and equitable access to medicines. We propose that
   pharmaceutical companies can be held accountable for human rights
   interferences by means of a provision in Dutch tort law containing an
   `unwritten duty of care', an interpretation which is supported by the
   international human rights framework and recent Dutch jurisprudence. We
   propose a concrete example of how this duty could be applied in Dutch
   courts, which have previously held a private corporation accountable for
   contributing to dangerous climate change in the Milieudefensie et al. v
   Royal Dutch Shell case. To establish whether this duty could be applied
   to pharmaceutical companies, we use the court's reasoning in
   Milieudefensie to assess the existence of a global consensus on the need
   for a pharmaceutical duty of care. We argue that human rights norms and
   soft law instruments that pharmaceutical companies themselves have
   endorsed prove that there is a growing consensus regarding the damage
   associated with excessively priced medicines, and an urgent need to
   establish a framework for holding pharmaceutical companies accountable
   for ensuring equitable access to medicines through legal measures.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},

Abstract = {This article explores how the families of the disappeared in Nepal, in
   the absence of any substantive state-led transitional justice process,
   have mobilized to created victim groups to drive local political and
   social engagements with violations of the decade long internal conflict.
   Victims' groups have informally memorialized their missing relatives and
   ultimately successfully advocated with local government to advance local
   memorialization through official processes. Victim-led memory practices
   have had an impact on local government policy, and these serve to
   enhance the role of victim groups as agents of social change. Using case
   studies from two local authorities as examples, we seek to highlight how
   localized memory practices empower and mobilize victims, advancing their
   role as political and social actors in processes of social change and
   blurring the conceptual division between state and community-led
   process. This article seeks to challenge the longstanding conflation of
   `local' and `informal' (meaning initiated and led by non-state actors)
   to describe the transitional justice process, by showing how when led by
   local authorities, this process can both empower victims and challenge
   impunity at the federal level.},

Abstract = {This article examines the political and conceptual possibilities of
   defiance to marriage as a gendered norm through the deviant words
   expressed in the lyrics of Bangla (Bengali) folk songs, in particular
   those in the Bhawaiya tradition. Bhawaiya is famous for its lyrics of
   embodied or sensual love, often in the form of deviant and ``illicit{''}
   relations outside of marriage, expressed through the female voice of the
   songs. When performed, the songs can evoke similar deviant emotions in
   the performers and the listeners, creating an affective atmosphere and
   constructing a ``temporal subjectivity{''} with the emotions of the
   female subjects of the songs, which I call the ``sexual subaltern.{''} I
   argue that throughout the colonial and postcolonial nationalist reforms
   and the emergence of strict reproductive heteropatriarchy in Bengal, the
   lyrics of Bhawaiya songs remained popular under the radar and as the
   artifacts of deviant sexual desire of the female subjects of the songs.
   This article goes further in examining how the temporal and affective
   subjectivity of the sexual subaltern, with deviant and defiant emotions,
   as constructed through these songs, can offer an alternative conceptual
   tool to dislocate West-centric feminist-queer politics and provide a
   global feminist remapping.},

Abstract = {With the rise of globalisation, internationalisation has become a key
   trend in higher education systems worldwide. After the change of
   leadership in 2016, Uzbekistan began to internationalise its higher
   education (HE) system. While this change in HE policy has brought some
   liberalisation to the sector, there is no clear developmental strategy,
   and the needs of academic staff are not represented. In the case of
   Uzbekistan, this article argues that HE internationalisation is a
   cosmetic measure enforced by the government, and that universities lack
   independent internationalisation strategies. The argument is supported
   by a content analysis of policy documents and interviews with 22
   university lecturers during fieldwork in Tashkent in 2020. The research
   findings contribute to knowledge about HE internationalisation in a
   non-Western, developing country.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND GENDER},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 18},
Abstract = {Advocacy for historically marginalized groups is often attributed to
   officeholders who are viewed as group members themselves, called
   ``descriptive representatives.{''} However, this account of political
   representation rarely includes whether the officeholder self-identifies
   as a group member. A burgeoning literature examines the significance of
   public figures' self-presentation. This study splices public figures'
   self-presentation into analyses of the correspondence between
   descriptive and substantive representation. It examines the US
   Democratic primary debates (2019-20) for descriptive and substantive
   representation. It shows that public figures who are not widely received
   as members of historically marginalized groups may nonetheless
   narratively construct the descriptive representation that is generally
   expected to go with substantive representation. Individuals who are
   widely viewed as descriptive representatives do not consistently call
   attention to this group membership; however, when they do, they are
   especially likely to advocate for the social groups whose membership
   they are understood to share.},

Abstract = {In the twenty-first century, there has been a notable increase in the
   number of women leaders across various regions. Inspired by postcolonial
   feminism, this study investigates the experiences of women political
   leaders in local elections in Indonesia since 2005. While many of these
   women leaders benefited from familial ties in their political careers,
   the research underscores that their ascent was not solely dependent on
   male authority. Instead, they tapped into a variety of resources linked
   to their gender identity as women, such as active involvement in women's
   networks and communities. Moreover, this study delineates how these
   women leaders actively pursued public roles in politics rather than
   passively conforming to the constraints of kodrat (one's inherent
   biological nature rooted in faith). Their experiences exemplify what
   this research terms ``hybrid feminist leadership,{''} which is
   characterized by a blend of reliance on male power and assertive
   utilization of their womanhood, all within redefined boundaries of
   traditional feminine roles. Ultimately, the article contributes to the
   understanding of female leadership in Asia by framing feminist
   leadership within the realm of micro-politics.},

Abstract = {How do residents evaluate zoning relief applications for new houses of
   worship? Do they decide based on the facility's expected level of
   nuisance, the religion of the house of worship, or the attitudes of
   neighbors and local officials? Using a conjoint survey experiment, this
   paper shows that religion is the most important predictor of resistance.
   People are more likely to resist new mosques than Christian churches,
   irrespective of other facility properties. Furthermore, this paper
   highlights the significant role of partisanship in residents' evaluation
   of zoning relief applications. Republican respondents were more likely
   to reject minority houses of worship and support Christian churches than
   Democrats, moderating the influence of religion. Such bias has important
   implications for the zoning relief application process. Local officials
   should evaluate residents' opposition differently when the application
   concerns minority groups.},

Title = {Justice ``to Come{''}? Decolonial Deconstruction, from Postmodern
   Policymaking to the Black Horizon},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},

Abstract = {This article explores the importance of what we call ``decolonial
   deconstruction{''} for contemporary global politics and policy
   discourses and develops a critique of this approach. ``Decolonial
   deconstruction{''} seeks to keep open policy processes, deconstructing
   liberal policy goals of peace, democracy, or justice as always ``to
   come{''}. It emerged through a nexus of postmodern and decolonial
   framings, well represented in the critical Black studies tradition,
   where theorists have focused upon identity construction, rejecting
   static conceptions. These approaches have increasingly been taken up in
   international policymaking approaches and International relations
   theory, particularly in the field of peacebuilding and the broad policy
   approach of resilience. After highlighting the ways that processual
   understandings of deconstruction have transformed these policy areas, we
   suggest an alternative deconstructive approach. In doing so, we draw
   upon the critical Black studies tradition but emphasize the need to
   critique underlying ontological assumptions about the world. We
   heuristically set out this approach as the ``Black Horizon.{''}

   la consolidation de la paix et l'approche politique de la r \&

   Este art \& iacute;culo estudia la importancia que tiene lo que llamamos
   << deconstrucci \& oacute;n decolonial >> para la pol \& iacute;tica
   global contempor \& aacute;nea y los discursos pol \& iacute;ticos y
   desarrolla una cr \& iacute;tica de este enfoque. La << deconstrucci \&
   oacute;n decolonial >> busca mantener abiertos los procesos pol \&
   iacute;ticos, a trav \& eacute;s de la deconstrucci \& oacute;n de los
   objetivos de las pol \& iacute;ticas liberales de paz, democracia o
   justicia como algo que siempre est \& aacute; << por venir >>. La <<
   deconstrucci \& oacute;n decolonial >> surgi \& oacute; a trav \&
   eacute;s de un nexo de uni \& oacute;n entre encuadres posmodernos y
   decoloniales, bien representados en la tradici \& oacute;n cr \&
   iacute;tica de los estudios de la cultura negra americana, donde los te
   \& oacute;ricos se han centrado en la construcci \& oacute;n de la
   identidad, rechazando las concepciones est \& aacute;ticas. Estos
   enfoques se han adoptado, cada vez m \& aacute;s, tanto en los
   planteamientos de formulaci \& oacute;n de pol \& iacute;ticas
   internacionales como en la teor \& iacute;a de las relaciones
   internacionales, en particular en el campo de la consolidaci \& oacute;n
   de la paz y en el amplio enfoque pol \& iacute;tico de la resiliencia.
   Destacamos las formas en las que las comprensiones procesuales de la
   deconstrucci \& oacute;n han transformado estas \& aacute;reas de pol \&
   iacute;tica con el fin de, posteriormente, sugerir un enfoque
   deconstructivo alternativo. Para llevar esto a cabo, partimos de la
   tradici \& oacute;n cr \& iacute;tica de los estudios de la cultura
   negra americana, pero enfatizamos la necesidad de criticar los supuestos
   ontol \& oacute;gicos subyacentes sobre el mundo. Definimos este
   enfoque, de manera heur \& iacute;stica, como el << Horizonte de la
   cultura negra americana >>.},

Abstract = {This article considers whether the South African government is currently
   meeting its obligations under international law to take appropriate
   legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect
   children from all forms of violence. Research has consistently
   demonstrated that exposure to violence at a young age can have an
   immense negative impact on children's survival and future development.
   Accordingly, adopting and implementing effective measures to eliminate
   violence against children is a pressing concern, especially in the South
   African context. With these objectives in mind, this article evaluates
   the South African Children's Act 38 of 2005 and the National Childcare
   and Protection Policy 2021, in light of the obligations contained in the
   United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, with a focus on
   prevention and early intervention strategies.},

Abstract = {The Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) adopted in response to the
   COVID-19 pandemic marks an important departure in European Union (EU)
   governance, as it introduces an innovative ``demand-driven,
   performance-based{''} model aimed at overcoming the limitations of past
   policies seeking to promote national reforms. In this study, we set out
   the theoretical assumptions underlying the RRF governance model, and
   assess its practical effectiveness and legitimacy by analyzing the
   drafting, implementation, and monitoring of National Recovery and
   Resilience Plans in eight member states. The study concludes by
   assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the RRF's governance model,
   relating them to theoretical expectations derived from previous
   international experience with similar approaches elsewhere, and
   considers the implications for future EU policy. Our core argument is
   that while the RRF's governance design has reinforced national ownership
   and commitment to reform and investment objectives, its
   performance-based financing system leads to a mechanical focus on formal
   verification of predetermined milestones and targets, with negative
   consequences for both effectiveness and legitimacy. Addressing these
   problems would require a redesign of the RRF's complete contracting
   approach, giving member states greater flexibility on the means for
   achieving agreed commitments, as well as for revising them, not only in
   response to unanticipated changes in objective circumstances, but also
   to lessons learned during the implementation process.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) is facing a democratic deficit, which scholars
   have argued political parties could help resolve. However, few have
   asked what model of party (system) is suitable for achieving this. To
   assume that the models of party politics used in the nation-state
   context can simply be transposed to the European level would be
   mistaken. A new model is needed that theorises parties as genuine
   multilevel actors whose behaviour at the European level can only be
   understood by also appreciating national-level dynamics, and vice versa.
   I argue that organisational field theory can help innovate the way we
   think about party democracy in the EU, introducing the European
   Multilevel Party Field. It is based on the understanding that European
   politics is `everything everywhere all at once', with actors operating
   in permanent interdependence with others across levels and borders. This
   model helps capture more accurately the complex reality of European
   politics.},

Abstract = {When governments are faced with long-term issues like climate change, it
   is often argued that they bias the short term over the long term,
   leading to inadequate policy responses. However, the shortsightedness of
   European Union (EU) climate governance has varied over time and between
   policy areas. This suggests that, under certain conditions, EU
   policy-makers can formulate policies for the long term. This article
   examines the shortsighted mechanisms in the decision-making of the
   European Commission, European Parliament and Council of the EU on two
   groups of cases: (1) the 2030 Climate Framework and the Fit for 55
   Package and (2) the 2014, 2019 and 2023 Regulations on the CO2 emission
   performance standards for new passenger cars. The article reveals that
   responsiveness to electoral and interest group concerns differs amongst
   EU institutions, and depending on the shortsightedness of these
   concerns, their own shortsightedness may likewise vary.},

Abstract = {This article is concerned with the historical evolution of the mining
   industry in Canada since 1859. The focus is directed on changes that
   occurred in the industry and allows for the identification of four
   distinct mining regimes. These regimes are defined using the Regulation
   Theory, which connects conditions of production, technical progress,
   financial structures, and social relations. The identification of
   regimes gives a portrait of continuity and change in the industry.
   Continuity is present in the active role of the state, the legal
   framework based on Free Mining Principle and persistent speculation in
   the industry. Change is illustrated in price cycle, labour share and
   technological innovation. Interestingly, through time, price cycles have
   very different outcomes in financial and real economic terms. The most
   recent upswing in the late 1990s resulted in a punctual increase of
   financial assets but no significant increase in employment. Through this
   discussion, it becomes evident that the mechanisms underlying continuity
   and change have implications on the nature of state intervention and on
   the distribution of power between the corporate and regional actors like
   the workers and indigenous communities.},

Abstract = {Critics of evidence-based crime prevention argue that extant research
   lacks insight into aspects of crime control and prevention that are
   critical to policymakers. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
   programs require the use of experimental and quasi-experimental designs,
   and some scholars argue that relaxing that methodological criterion
   would result in a larger pool of studies that could better inform policy
   and practice. We test that proposition by using a comprehensive database
   of 160 evaluation studies of public-area video surveillance and
   measuring their policy relevance by looking for four specific factors:
   causal mechanisms, moderators, implementation, and economic costs. We
   find that studies incorporating experimental and high-quality
   quasi-experimental designs scored significantly higher than studies
   using less rigorous designs on three of the four dimensions. This
   suggests that adherence to a high standard of methodological rigor does
   not compromise the practical value of video surveillance research. We
   then discuss the implications of this finding.},

Title = {Coloniality, Race, and Europeanness: Britain's Borders after Brexit},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {The scholarship on the politics of immigration often frames governments'
   responses to far-right mobilization as a return to border closures and a
   rowing back on neoliberalism. In this article, I draw on and expand the
   scholarship on coloniality to address the limitations of this diagnosis.
   Specifically, I explore the role of political mobilization in the making
   of the post-Brexit border regime. My research draws on the analysis of
   legal and policy initiatives between 2020 and 2023 and twenty-three
   research interviews with individuals who express their opposition to
   immigration via engagement in think tanks, grassroots organizations and
   vigilante groups. The interview data indicates multiple connections
   between these milieus and shows that each engages in action repertoires
   beyond the nation-state. And while this prompts border closures, the
   post-Brexit border regime also encodes openings and loopholes for the
   circulation of financial elites and precariously employed workers. Thus,
   I argue that state and non-state actors co-produce a neoliberal border
   regime of stratified rights, partial inclusions, and gradual exclusions.
   These variegated entitlements draw on and reinvigorate the racial order
   of coloniality. The post-Brexit immigration regime enables the free
   mobility of those racialized as ``West European,{''} facilitates
   disposable labor mobility of those racialized as ``Eastern European,{''}
   and restricts the movement of those racialized as ``non-European.{''}
   This racial imaginary does not only operate via binary distinctions of
   (non)-Britishness but puts people in complex hierarchical relations to
   ``Europeanness.{''}
   Les chercheurs sp \& eacute;cialistes des migrations pr \&
   eacute;sentent souvent les r \& eacute;ponses des gouvernements aux
   mobilisations d'extr \& ecirc;me droite comme un retour \& agrave; la
   fermeture des fronti \& egrave;res et une contradiction du n \&
   eacute;olib \& eacute;ralisme. Je viens enrichir la recherche sur la
   colonialit \& eacute; pour pallier les limites de ce diagnostic. Plus pr
   \& eacute;cis \& eacute;ment, je m'int \& eacute;resse au r \& ocirc;le
   de la mobilisation politique dans la constitution du r \& eacute;gime
   frontalier post-Brexit. Cette analyse s'appuie sur des initiatives
   juridiques et politiques de 2020 \& agrave; 2023 et sur 25 entretiens de
   recherche avec des personnes exprimant leur opposition \& agrave;
   l'immigration par leur participation au sein de think tanks,
   d'organisations locales ou de groupes d'autod \& eacute;fense. Les donn
   \& eacute;es indiquent l'existence de nombre de liens entre ces milieux
   et montrent que chacun emploie un r \& eacute;pertoire d'actions qui va
   au-del \& agrave; de l'\& Eacute;tat-nation. Et, bien que cela pousse \&
   agrave; la fermeture des fronti \& egrave;res, le r \& eacute;gime
   frontalier post-Brexit encode \& eacute;galement des ouvertures pour la
   circulation des \& eacute;lites financi \& egrave;res et des
   travailleurs pr \& eacute;caires. Aussi, j'affirme que les acteurs \&
   eacute;tatiques et non \& eacute;tatiques produisent conjointement un r
   \& eacute;gime frontalier n \& eacute;olib \& eacute;ral de
   stratification des droits, d'inclusions partielles et d'exclusions
   progressives. Ces divers droits redynamisent l'ordre racial de la
   colonialit \& eacute;. Le r \& eacute;gime d'immigration permet la libre
   circulation des individus racialis \& eacute;s comme \& eacute;tant des
   << Europ \& eacute;ens de l'Ouest >>, facilite la mobilit \& eacute; des
   travailleurs << jetables >>, racialis \& eacute;s comme des << Europ \&
   eacute;ens de l'Est >>, et restreint les mouvements des personnes
   racialis \& eacute;es comme des << non-Europ \& eacute;ens >>. Au-del \&
   agrave; des distinctions binaires Britannique/Non britannique, cet
   imaginaire racial place les Europ \& eacute;ens dans des relations hi \&
   eacute;rarchiques complexes.
   Los acad \& eacute;micos del campo de la migraci \& oacute;n tienden a
   caracterizar las respuestas de los Gobiernos a las movilizaciones de
   extrema derecha como un regreso al cierre de fronteras y un retroceso en
   el neoliberalismo. Ampliamos el conocimiento existente en materia de
   colonialidad con el fin de abordar las limitaciones de este diagn \&
   oacute;stico. En concreto, estudiamos el papel que juega la movilizaci
   \& oacute;n pol \& iacute;tica sobre la construcci \& oacute;n del r \&
   eacute;gimen fronterizo post-Brexit. Para este an \& aacute;lisis,
   partimos de la base de iniciativas legales y pol \& iacute;ticas que
   tuvieron lugar entre 2020 y 2023 y de 25 entrevistas de investigaci \&
   oacute;n a personas que expresan su oposici \& oacute;n a la inmigraci
   \& oacute;n a trav \& eacute;s de su participaci \& oacute;n en grupos
   de expertos, organizaciones de base y grupos de vigilantes. Estos datos
   indican la existencia de m \& uacute;ltiples conexiones entre estos
   entornos y demuestran que cada uno de ellos participa en repertorios de
   acci \& oacute;n que se encuentran m \& aacute;s all \& aacute; del
   nivel Estado naci \& oacute;n. Aunque esto puede provocar cierres de
   fronteras, el r \& eacute;gimen fronterizo posterior al Brexit tambi \&
   eacute;n codifica una apertura para la circulaci \& oacute;n de las \&
   eacute;lites financieras y para los trabajadores con empleos precarios.
   Por lo tanto, argumentamos que los actores, tanto estatales como no
   estatales, coproducen un r \& eacute;gimen fronterizo neoliberal formado
   por derechos estratificados, inclusiones parciales y exclusiones
   graduales. Estos derechos variados revitalizan el orden racial de la
   colonialidad. El r \& eacute;gimen de inmigraci \& oacute;n permite la
   libre movilidad de aquellas personas consideradas racialmente como <<
   europeas occidentales >>, facilita la movilidad de mano de obra
   desechable por parte de aquellas personas consideradas racialmente como
   << europeas orientales >> y restringe la circulaci \& oacute;n de las
   personas consideradas racialmente como << no europeas >>. M \& aacute;s
   all \& aacute; de las distinciones binarias de (no) ``britanidad,{''}
   este imaginario racial sit \& uacute;a a las personas en complejas
   relaciones jer \& aacute;rquicas con la ``europeidad.{''}},

Abstract = {The state-centric nature of international law has been recognized as a
   severe barrier to the realization of human rights since the outset and
   remains a concern today across the globe. However, the dominant space
   the state has historically occupied within the field as duty-bearer,
   deemed almost exclusively responsible for citizens' enjoyment of rights,
   faces a small yet by no means insignificant challenge in the form of
   human rights cities. While there is a rich literature surrounding
   municipalities whose local governments embrace non-discrimination,
   participatory democracy and other human rights principles, a distinct,
   yet equally fascinating development is the trend in cities who have
   committed to the furtherance of a singular right. One such phenomenon
   which has yet to receive significant attention within the academy is the
   rise in right to food cities in the UK, referring to those which have
   joined the campaign for domestic recognition of the right. In light of
   the UK government's deep-seated resistance to the right, this article
   explores the advent of right to food cities/municipalities and their
   potential as an alternative means of targeting hunger and food
   insecurity within the state. While it is recognized that each individual
   initiative may only have a localized impact, it is argued that their
   collective force should not be dismissed at this early stage-their calls
   for change are only likely to increase in fervour as the effects of the
   cost-of-living crisis upon the population worsen.},

Abstract = {Transformative constitutionalism and process theory are generally seen
   as worlds apart. But they may be more compatible than we think. A
   transformative understanding of process is very broad, but it represents
   a natural extension of the line already being taken by contemporary
   process accounts intent on expanding the theory to fit global practice.
   It can help us to understand why an expansion based on and including a
   wider set of justiciable process concerns has proved difficult to limit.
   Conversely, transformative constitutionalism badly needs a better
   account of judicial restraint to balance its preoccupation with judicial
   boldness. Since it shares with process theory a deep concern with
   democracy, it can naturally draw on process accounts to understand its
   own limits. Democracy-seeking review, in aiming to build as well as
   protect democratic capacity, needs to be as concerned with restraint as
   intervention, depending on the context. Working out a transformative
   process theory is therefore at least an exercise instructive to either
   side, and it can offer a way to overcome divides that hamper global
   engagement with these core constitutional issues.},

Abstract = {The politics of appointments have transformed the U.S. Supreme Court in
   recent years. We examine why and how the current conservative
   supermajority on the court came to be, with a particular focus on how
   this court stands apart from earlier ones. We trace the factors that
   allowed President Donald Trump to reshape the court with his three
   appointments in his first term and evaluate the importance of the
   conservative supermajority by connecting it to theories of the court's
   collective decision-making. We show that the current court is the
   culmination of a ``partisan sort{''} in appointments-a strict
   correlation between party and ideology-that began a few decades ago but
   did not fully crystallize until the 2010s. Finally, we summarize
   simulations that show why conservatives are likely to control the court
   for several decades.},

Abstract = {We investigate the transition between Fordism and neoliberalism in Italy
   employing insights from International (IPE) and Comparative Political
   Economy (CPE). Transitions are key periods to observe how countries tend
   to converge towards similar political economy developments through
   processes of social, political and institutional adaptation. We
   contribute to the literature by detailing how transformations in the
   `social and political bases of political economy' influence
   institutional change. We understand these transformations as movements
   from below (changes in sociodemographic and productive compositions, and
   social movements) and above (agency in political parties, trade unions,
   business associations and elites); we name these components `the social
   and productive composition' and `the social and political representation
   sphere' respectively. Employing process tracing, we identify three
   historical periods in post-WWII Italian political economy - state
   Fordism (1945-78), a transitional period we name `the long 1980s'
   (1979-91), and neoliberalism (1992-) - delineated by two historical
   ruptures: a breakup moment in 1978-9 that signalled the decline of
   Fordism, and a critical juncture that ushered in neoliberalism in 1992.
   Analytically, changes within the social and productive composition
   during state Fordism impacted on the social and political representation
   sphere, and on several reforms undertaken in different institutional
   domains. However, since the breakup moment 1978-9 this dynamic changed
   together with the international political economy context. Similar to
   other western countries, the main actors within the social and political
   representation sphere increasingly approached institutional regulation
   inspired by neoliberal ideas, while the pressures coming from the more
   active forces within the social and productive composition faltered.},

Abstract = {While Germany's response to the Russo-Ukrainian war continues to be
   intensely scrutinised, with much attention focusing on the Zeitenwende
   debate and Berlin's reluctance to pull its weight in NATO, we know
   little about how Germany anticipated the outbreak of war. The picture
   that has emerged is one of significant surprise among German
   policymakers when Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Germany's
   foreign intelligence service (Bundesnachrichtendienst, BND) has been
   criticised for failing to issue strong warnings, whereas BND officials
   have argued that their warnings went unheeded. This article contributes
   to discussions of what intelligence producers and policymakers could
   have been expected to know by exploring how selected external experts in
   Germany warned about a Russian attack on Ukraine. By reconstructing open
   expert assessments of the emerging crisis between 1 November 2021 and 23
   February 2022, this article finds that researchers in German think tanks
   and academia provided a steady flow of timely, accurate and convincing
   warnings. The findings suggest that external experts are especially well
   positioned to uncover structural vulnerabilities that threatening actors
   can exploit, discuss politically inconvenient trends, and offer
   actionable warnings. This adds to discussions of how external expertise
   can support intelligence production and crisis decision-making.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Number = {5},
Pages = {661-677},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {The paper explores the political conditions favourable to economic
   upgrading in democratic non-corporatist emerging economies with a focus
   on CEE countries as characteristic examples. While the existing
   literature has assumed this polity type to be the least favourable for
   designing and implementing effective industrial policies because of a
   lack of bureaucratic `embedded autonomy', the paper argues that this is
   not to suggest that such industrial policies and economic upgrading are
   rare in these economies, but rather that they involve different
   mechanisms of political mobilisation and support. To identify these
   mechanisms, the paper adopts a social bloc-based framework and applies
   it to an in-depth study of Estonia, a strong upgrader in the region in
   terms of its increased economic specialisation in ICT-based services.
   The paper finds that a lack of `embedded autonomy' can effectively be
   supplanted by the embeddedness of private actors in the state
   administration and political decision-making through a network-based
   configuration of the social bloc and a shared upgrading ideology leading
   to a conflation of private interests with national development goals.},

Abstract = {Bureaucratic rulemaking is a key feature of American policymaking.
   However, rulemaking activities do not occur uniformly, but fluctuate
   throughout the year. We consider three mechanisms to explain these
   changes in rule volume, each of which produces unique expectations for
   rulemaking during periods of divided government and legislative recess.
   To test these expectations, we leverage an original dataset including
   all rules proposed by bureaucratic agencies in three U.S. states from
   2004 to 2013 matched with data tracking periods of divided government
   and legislative recess. We find that state bureaucracies publish
   significantly more proposed rules during periods of divided government
   or a split legislature and are most productive in the months immediately
   following legislative recess. These results underscore the importance of
   bureaucratic policymaking and improve our understanding of the balance
   of power between branches of state governments.},

Abstract = {This article brings transitional justice scholarship to bear on the case
   of racial violence in the United States. We investigate how knowledge of
   racial terror lynchings shapes Black Americans' support for symbolic and
   material transitional justice measures. We administer a survey with an
   embedded experiment to Black residents in Maryland, a US transitional
   justice pioneer. We provide select respondents with information about
   historical lynching violence and find that they are more likely to
   support symbolic transitional justice (e.g., apologies and memorial
   markers) than individuals presented with information on contemporary
   police killings. Regarding material transitional justice (e.g., monetary
   reparations and community projects), we find no significant differences
   between groups. Linked fate excepted, we do not find that key aspects of
   Black identity and the Black American experience (i.e., historical
   knowledge, police contact, church involvement and Black nationalist
   beliefs) moderate transitional justice attitudes. Our work indicates the
   promise and limits of information campaigns to mobilize support for
   transitional justice.},

Abstract = {Transitional justice theorizing has the tendency to smuggle in an
   over-reliance on dualities: one's resentment can give rise to either
   vengeance or forgiveness, but not both; one can either be fueled by
   anger or by the hope of progress, but not both; and so on. This
   dualistic way of thinking replicates the kinds of false dichotomies that
   hamstring other societal movements, among them the struggle against
   racism. Drawing on Myisha Cherry's case for so-called `Lordean rage'
   within the context of the anti-racist movement, I make the case that
   transitional justice in general would be well-served by centering the
   transformative power of emotion (even and especially when that emotion
   defies oversimplified and strict categorization).},

   support for international agreements},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},

Abstract = {How does international shaming and praising affect domestic support for
   joining international agreements? Many scholars have examined the role
   of shaming in leading countries to support international agreements, and
   a wide literature on social opprobrium suggests that both governments
   and citizens are sensitive to being named and shamed. Yet far less is
   known about the dynamics of praise in international relations and how
   they compare to the dynamics of shame. This article uses a survey
   experiment to test and compare the effects of praising and shaming on
   individuals' support for their government joining an international
   agreement. Specifically, it tests whether praising or shaming from other
   countries leads individuals to support their country joining a
   hypothetical international agreement that would ban the use of explosive
   weapons. It finds that praising is effective in increasing public
   support for joining the treaty, while shaming is not. By examining the
   extent to which praising and shaming can shape public opinion on
   international security agreements, this article provides new insights

   constitution writing in Chile},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND GENDER},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 12},
Abstract = {Formal and informal rules mediate the relationship between descriptive
   and substantive representation. Women may be present in office but
   struggle to influence outcomes in the same way as their male
   counterparts, especially because parliaments and parties carry masculine
   blueprints that limit women's individual and collective power. Yet, what
   happens when new institutions incorporate new actors to write new rules
   and when women occupy these institutions under gender parity from the
   start? Using participant observation and interview data from Chile's
   first constitutional convention, we analyse how gender parity and
   newness combined to give `feminist designers' significant influence over
   the convention's procedural rules and, consequently, the final document.
   Newness and parity helped women secure the adoption of a feminist
   procedural code, which eliminated many of the masculine blueprints found
   in traditional parliaments. In turn, women delegates organised
   explicitly as feminists and led the redaction of a thoroughly feminist
   document.},

Abstract = {Following the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, tensions have
   heightened in the international relations and security environment,
   including the Arctic region. We are witnessing renewed geopolitical
   rivalry and military tensions between the Arctic states. In this
   article, a steps-to-war model of conflict escalation is used to
   calculate whether the conflict potential in the Arctic is rising. While
   our results confirm an increase in confrontational behaviour according
   to militarisation and coalition-building markers, the rivalry marker
   shows a rise in cooperative behaviour. Hence, in our model, the
   preconditions signalling an increased likelihood of international armed
   conflict are not fulfilled.},

Abstract = {How do declining great powers cope with a sudden loss of status? Great
   powers establish routinized relations of recognition to maintain and
   reproduce their status as great powers in the international sphere.
   During periods of structural change, when social norms and these
   routinized relations of recognition are in flux, the prospect of
   misrecognition is especially pronounced. Misrecognition leads to the
   experience of frustrated agency and ontological insecurity. In these
   scenarios, declining great powers assert agency over their status by
   anchoring their insecure identity in symbols that are expressive of
   their status as great powers. To illustrate this argument, the article
   considers France's decision to develop an independent nuclear capability
   after the Second World War. Rather than an instrument of security,
   nuclear weapons gave France the illusion of an independent identity and
   offered ontological security.},

Abstract = {Since the dissolution of the USSR, the Russian state has accommodated
   private property without abandoning its dominant position. This essay
   argues that, over two decades stretching from perestroika until the
   2000s, the centrality of the state has been embodied by technocratic
   continuity amongst upper and mid-level managers of Soviet and then
   Russian international finance. This case is made here by focusing on a
   group of Soviet bankers working out of Zurich. Two milestone events
   frame the argument articulated throughout the essay: the issue of the
   first Soviet international bond and the establishment of a
   Soviet-Western financial joint venture in the West in 1988, and the
   opening of a full-fledged Russian bank in the United States in 2011.},

Abstract = {If a Ministry of Equality and Feminisms were created from scratch in the
   government of your country or region, would you accept leading it? In
   May 2021, when asked by the just-invested Prime Minister of the
   Government of Catalonia, I answered, ``Yes, I do.{''} It was a big
   question, and the task ahead was even bigger, but a close friend helped
   me kill the vertigo. She said, ``Years of gender and politics research,
   consultancy work, and social activism should do,{''} while adding that
   being accorded great leeway to build up a team of social movement
   activists, feminist academics, and party feminists with experience in
   executive office was a unique opportunity to bolster feminist change.
   This combination yielded substantive knowledge of both the priorities of
   the movements and the political world and, simultaneously, accorded
   personal ties with politicians and the bureaucratic elite (Mazur and
   McBride 2007).},

Abstract = {For over two decades, Canadian corporations have been the subject of
   severe allegations of human rights and environmental violations related
   to the forced imposition of their operations abroad. Despite the growing
   consensus within the literature and international governance community
   that Canadian corporations-especially within the extractive sector-are
   serial perpetrators of grave human rights violations and despite
   Canada's international legal obligations, at present there are very
   little `hard law' mechanisms available to hold corporations to account.
   Whereas much literature has been dedicated to how Canadian corporations
   are facilitated by advocacy and lobbying efforts at the level of
   Canadian embassies in home-state-countries, much less studied is how
   these same state actors work towards protecting and preventing human
   rights defenders from harm. In this article we critically analyse the
   implementation of the Canadian government's Voices at Risk guidelines
   (2016) from the perspective of two Canadian human rights advocacy Civil
   Society Organizations (CSOs) supporting communities in Guatemala,
   drawing from email and verbal communications as well as Access to
   Information Requests from 2016 to 2021 regarding the Escobal mine. We
   assess the usefulness of advocacy at the level of embassies as a way of
   protecting defenders and demonstrate that, in our experience, calls for
   support to defenders were ignored. We argue that, within the context of
   foreign policy which prioritizes trade and investment over all other
   government policies and wherein corporate violence is met with impunity,
   current Canadian policies aimed at protecting human rights defenders are
   essentially useless as an advocacy strategy.},

Abstract = {The rise of `bigtech' finance - the provision of payment services and
   financial intermediation by large digital platforms - poses significant
   cross-border regulatory challenges with implications for financial
   stability. Yet despite steps to strengthen regulation at the domestic
   level, international cooperation in this area remains very limited.
   Although geopolitical rivalry over digital technology has hindered
   progress towards agreement on global rules, we know far less about the
   technical barriers to standard-setting in this new and complex field. To
   address this, the paper combines scholarship on international regime
   complexity and transnational knowledge to understand the epistemic
   challenges of international standard-setting in an `emergent' regime
   complex. We argue that regulatory cooperation around bigtech is
   constrained by two main epistemic barriers: cognitive limits to
   understanding; and the existence of siloed knowledge. Furthermore, we
   show how international bodies strive to overcome these barriers by
   generating new transnational knowledge through processes of inscription
   and orchestration. The paper makes a wider contribution to the
   `epistemic turn' in IPE by unpacking the contested meanings and
   practices of standard-setting in new regulatory fields.},

Abstract = {The average age of the population and the ratio of workers to pensioners
   in the European Union (EU) are rising, putting increasing pressure on
   the long-term sustainability of pension systems. To counteract this
   development, a large number of pension reform recommendations (PRRs)
   have been issued within EU socio-economic governance. In this article,
   we analyse the extent to which PRRs are consistent with the three main
   objectives of the open method of coordination (OMC), which emphasise (i)
   financial sustainability, (ii) benefit adequacy and (iii) modernisation
   with respect to gender equality. Using an original dataset, we code 438
   PRRs from 2011 to 2023 and analyse the extent to which these are
   consistent with the three main objectives of the OMC. Our results show
   that PRRs are primarily focused on financial sustainability, to the
   detriment of adequacy and modernisation, and that they are driven solely
   by sustainability concerns.},

Title = {Thinking through 1492: IR's Historiographic Operation(s) and the
   Politics of Benchmark Dates},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT 4},
Abstract = {This Collective Discussion aims to open up space for an international
   political sociology of the production of historical knowledge that
   interrogates the politics around benchmark dates and what becomes
   knowable and unknowable through them. Specifically, it examines 1492 as
   a historiographical device through which to unpack how the discipline of
   IR knows history. 1492 presents a relevant case for this interrogation,
   for it is central for the historical narratives of a variety of
   approaches. In this sense, the different contributions do not seek to
   recover an alternative, `better' history of 1492, but rather to explore
   its politics of knowledge production: what types of histories it makes
   visible, what types it precludes, and in what way it partakes in the
   reproduction of specific hierarchies of knowledge and the power
   structures that operate through them. In doing so, the Collective
   Discussion makes visible - and thus opens up for discussion - the
   historiographical operations performed by periodization and benchmark
   dating in IR, pointing to a way forward for an international political
   sociology of knowledge production in the discipline.
   Cette discussion collective vise \& agrave; ouvrir un espace favorisant
   l'\& eacute;mergence d'une sociologie politique internationale de la
   production de connaissances historiques. Cette derni \& egrave;re
   interroge la politique autour des dates historiques et ce qui devient
   connaissable et inconnaissable \& agrave; travers elles. Plus pr \&
   eacute;cis \& eacute;ment, elle utilise l'ann \& eacute;e 1492 en tant
   que dispositif historiographique pour analyser la mani \& egrave;re dont
   la discipline des relations internationales conna \& icirc;t l'histoire.
   L'ann \& eacute;e 1492 pr \& eacute;sente un cas pertinent pour cette
   question, car elle est au centre des r \& eacute;cits historiques de
   plusieurs approches. En ce sens, les diff \& eacute;rentes contributions
   ne cherchent pas \& agrave; reconstituer une histoire alternative ou
   ``meilleure{''} de l'ann \& eacute;e 1492, mais plut \& ocirc;t \&
   agrave; \& eacute;tudier sa politique de production de connaissances en
   se posant les questions suivantes : quels types d'histoires rend-elle
   visibles? Quels types exclut-elle? De quelle mani \& egrave;re
   participe-t-elle \& agrave; la reproduction de hi \& eacute;rarchies et
   des structures de pouvoir qui op \& egrave;rent \& agrave; travers
   elles? Ce faisant, la discussion collective rend visibles les op \&
   eacute;rations historiographiques r \& eacute;alis \& eacute;es par la p
   \& eacute;riodisation et la datation historique en RI. Cette discussion
   indique une voie \& agrave; suivre pour encourager une sociologie
   politique internationale de la production de connaissances dans la
   discipline.
   Esta discusi \& oacute;n colectiva pretende abrir espacio para una
   sociolog \& iacute;a pol \& iacute;tica internacional de la producci \&
   oacute;n de conocimiento hist \& oacute;rico que pueda cuestionar el uso
   de fechas de referencia y los l \& iacute;mites del conocimiento a trav
   \& eacute;s de ellas. Espec \& iacute;ficamente, nos centramos en el a
   \& ntilde;o 1492 como un ejemplo de dispositivo historiogr \&
   aacute;fico a trav \& eacute;s del cual podemos analizar c \& oacute;mo
   el campo de las RRII aborda la historia. 1492 es un caso relevante para
   este cuestionamiento, ya que es un a \& ntilde;o clave en las narrativas
   hist \& oacute;ricas de diversos enfoques. En este sentido, las
   diferentes contribuciones no buscan recuperar una historia alternativa o
   ``mejorada{''} de 1492, sino explorar sus consecuencias para la producci
   \& oacute;n de conocimiento: qu \& eacute; tipos de historias hace
   visibles, qu \& eacute; tipos de historias excluye y de qu \& eacute;
   manera participa en la reproducci \& oacute;n de jerarqu \& iacute;as de
   conocimiento y de las estructuras de poder que operan a trav \& eacute;s
   de ellas. De esta manera, esta discusi \& oacute;n colectiva hace
   visibles las operaciones historiogr \& aacute;ficas realizadas por la
   periodizaci \& oacute;n y la dataci \& oacute;n de referencia en las
   RRII, y con ello posibilita su discusi \& oacute;n, se \& ntilde;alando
   un camino a seguir para una sociolog \& iacute;a pol \& iacute;tica

Abstract = {As part of the ``Solar Geoengineering: Ethics, Governance, and
   International Politics{''} roundtable, this essay examines dilemmas
   arising in exploring nonideal scenarios of solar geoengineering
   deployment. Model-based knowledge about solar geoengineering tells us
   little about possible climatic responses to malicious, self-interested,
   or competing deployments, and even less about political or cultural
   responses outside of the climate system. The essay argues that policy
   for governing solar geoengineering in a world of multiple states and
   uneven power relations requires a broader base for solar geoengineering
   knowledge, beyond that offered by modeling, and a better understanding
   of nonideal scenarios, especially those motivated by logics beyond
   reducing climate impacts. It highlights the interests of military and
   security actors in such knowledge, and the potential for it to
   facilitate securitization and further reduce the prospect of
   multilateral collaborative governance of geoengineering in the public
   interest. The essay concludes that further research can be ethically
   justified but must be comprehensively governed.},

Abstract = {Can Russian antigenderist discourse constitute an illiberal soft-power
   potential for the Russian government even in a West European state such
   as Norway? We define `antigenderist discourse' as discourse rejecting
   equal rights, visibility or the very existence of all or some sexual and
   gender minorities. Despite some important differences regarding content
   and actors, both Norwegian and Russian media contain discourses where
   the freedom to be conservative, children's safety and identity
   collectives, such as nation states, are constructed as being under
   attack from `gender ideology', an umbrella term used by some
   conservatives for liberal ideas on sexual and gender minorities. This
   discursive overlap gives Russia some soft-power potential over
   antigenderist circles in Norway, but this potential appears weakly
   realised in practice, as the Norwegian texts examined here contain few
   explicitly positive references to Russian antigenderist policies.},

Title = {Financialization and an emerging ``green investor state{''}: Examining
   China's use of state-backed funds for green transition},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {349-369},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {China is simultaneously enacting a state-led financialization of
   governance and a prioritization of environmental objectives.
   Resultingly, dedicated state-backed green funds have grown in scale
   beyond US\$70 billion. Drawing on interviews, policies, and financial
   databases, we examine these funds through policy document analysis,
   descriptive statistics, and three case studies. Tying together the
   literature on ``financialization{''} and the ``green state{''} we show
   how China's ``market-driven, government-guided{''} type of state-led
   financialization enhances the country's green state investment capacity.
   This is distinct from other countries' experience of diminishing
   capacities resulting from financialization of the state. We introduce
   the concept of a ``green investor state{''} to capture China's approach
   and argue that the approach is difficult to replicate beyond
   state-capitalist economies. However, the gradual return of industrial
   policy elsewhere makes the use of similar funds increasingly feasible
   globally, warranting further research on the use of green funds under
   none-state-led types of financialization.},

Abstract = {Since the 1990s, the EU has attempted to create a common electricity
   market. However, EU legislators are unsatisfied by the results. We argue
   that differentiated implementation of directives over time creates path
   dependencies that entrench national differences. The actor constellation
   of parties and incumbent operators at the beginning of the
   liberalization path determines how well countries implement liberalizing
   directives. The implementation, in turn, changes the actor constellation
   for the next directive, increasing or decreasing the institutional power
   of incumbents. We illustrate our argument analyzing the implementation
   of the first three energy market packages in Germany and the
   Netherlands. Both countries had similar electricity markets at the
   beginning of market liberalization, but their actor constellation was
   slightly different. German implementation gradually strengthened
   vertically integrated utilities, while Dutch implementation dismantled
   these utilities through unbundling. These paths became self-reinforcing,
   counteracting European harmonization efforts.},

Abstract = {In this article, we introduce an innovative theoretical framework to
   analyse the use of differentiated implementation in the implementation
   process of European Union (EU) Directives. We identify rationales for
   offering flexibility in EU Directives as well as motives for
   policy-makers to make use of the discretion. We analyse patterns and
   drivers of differentiated implementation under the Energy Efficiency
   Directive (EED) in four member states in order to assess whether
   practices of differentiated implementation conform to the rationales for
   offering flexibility. We show that member states mainly use the
   flexibility offered to retain existing policies. In addition, the EED
   led to some mutual learning based on experimentation, although this
   effect is limited. Whilst the EED offered a high potential for mutual
   learning, the member states did not use this opportunity. Overall, the
   implementation of the EED offers mixed evidence for the use of
   differentiated implementation to support differentiation.},

Volume = {26},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {In the context of the prevalence of anti-gender politics in Europe,
   political institutions such as parliaments have become arenas of
   political struggles around gender and gender equality. While feminist
   scholarship has studied anti-gender politics, less attention has been
   paid to feminist responses to such opposition. The contribution of this
   article is to conceptualize feminist responses to anti-gender politics
   within political institutions, which we name feminist institutional
   responses. This conceptualization entails proposing a set of analytical
   categories for capturing forms of feminist institutional responses -
   namely, knowledge, coalition building, rule making, and everyday
   pragmatic engagement. We analyze 50 plenary debates on gender equality
   and two plenary debates on the State of the Union, as well as 135
   interviews with members of the European Parliament and political staff
   during two terms that witnessed a rise in anti-gender politics,
   2014-2019 and 2019-2024. The conceptualization of feminist institutional
   responses to anti-gender politics in parliaments is important for
   identifying how institutional actors are countering the destructive
   potential of anti-gender politics and safeguarding parliaments as
   democratic sites for the advancement of gender equality policies.},

Abstract = {Private intrusion, interception, and surveillance (PIIS) markets
   represent a key vehicle for the global expansion of digital surveillance
   regimes. Yet, due to their opacity and notorious secrecy, these markets
   have received relatively little scholarly attention. Triangulating
   between a unique dataset comprising 5973 industry presentations,
   interviews, and industry reports, this article provides novel insights
   into the evolution of market structures and public control efforts.
   Conceptualizing the PIIS-market as a dynamic and fluid assemblage, we
   highlight how the enmeshment of social, political, and technological
   dimensions shaped hierarchies and agencies of control. Our findings
   point towards the existence of three intersecting dynamics of
   territorialization, changing technological affordances, and ordering
   that persistently undermined attempts to limit market operations. In
   reflecting on these past failures, the presented approach points towards
   the importance of timing and highlights a need to re-conceptualize
   control in state-market relations from an assemblage perspective,
   pragmatically working across bureaucratic boundaries and leveraging
   disparate power centers across the public and private divide.
   Considering the growing interest in economic dependencies and the
   strategic dimension of high-tech markets, these findings have a wider
   relevance to current debates about the rise of economic security states.},

Abstract = {In the last few years, Jewish Currents has been the intellectual
   storm-centre of a multi-sided, inter-generational debate within the
   Jewish community about breaking with Israel over its occupation
   strategy-and the war on Gaza in particular. The Currents project-print
   journal, online articles, weekly newsletters, podcasts, live events-has
   helped to develop a far-reaching left critique of the American-Jewish
   establishment strategy as essentially A`mericanist assimilationism plus
   Zionism'. Publishing Palestinian voices from Gaza, the West Bank and the
   diaspora, it has broken a series of American taboos, not least in
   advancing a concrete plan for the realization of Palestinian refugees'
   right to return, a start on what one writer has called the hard work of
   `decolonization, reparation, reconciliation'.1 1 Your own writing and
   thinking as editor-in-chief has played a central role in all this. May
   we start by asking you about your personal formation-your family
   background, education, radicalization?},

Abstract = {Over the past 20 years, there has been growing concern over a purported
   link between proactive policing to control crime and unfair, biased, and
   abusive policing approaches. Overly aggressive and indiscriminate
   policing initiatives run the risk of driving a wedge between police and
   the communities they serve, with residents of disadvantaged
   neighborhoods feeling less like partners and more like targets. At the
   same time, research suggests that effective policing has an important
   impact on public safety. We present a conceptual framework for how
   police can prevent crime while minimizing unintended harm. We focus
   particularly on cities and urban communities, arguing that the benefits
   of policing can be maximized and the costs of policing can be minimized
   when the police respect individual rights and dignity and focus on
   community, and that problem solving should begin with a focus on risky
   people in the places that generate the most crime.},

Abstract = {We discuss the geoeconomics of the Single Market in financial services
   in the European Union (EU). We examine three case studies that concern
   the EU and other major jurisdictions and that range from incipient
   geoeconomic use to outward weaponisation of the Single Market in
   finance. These cases are (1) the post-2008 crisis transatlantic tug of
   war, whereby the EU leveraged its Single Market vis-\& agrave;-vis the
   United States, seeking to set the rules for global finance; (2) the
   Brexit negotiations, when the EU acted as a bloc against the United
   Kingdom and successfully safeguarded the integrity of the Single Market;
   and (3) the fulsome war in Ukraine, during which the EU `weaponised' its
   Single Market through the adoption of financial sanctions against
   Russia. We argue that a combination of external and internal factors
   accounts for this pattern: the evolution of the international economic
   and political system, in particular, the increasing challenges to the
   liberal international order, and intra-EU developments, namely, the EU's
   ability to deploy its Single Market geoeconomically.},

Abstract = {Developing legislation to counter the negative impacts of businesses'
   transnational activities on human rights and the environment is a recent
   trend. Supporters of such legislation have campaigned to convince
   policy-makers to adopt strong law, but this legitimation process has not
   been theorised. Using Vaara et al.'s theoretical framework, we uncover
   the six discursive legitimation strategies used by the proponents of the
   European Union (EU) Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive
   (CSDDD) to legitimise its creation. Based on interviews with proponents,
   we offer two main findings. First, the directive's supporters seek to
   reverse the narrative that legislation with extraterritorial
   implications is neo-colonial by arguing instead that the neoliberal
   status quo exemplifies neo-colonial exploitation. Second,
   non-governmental organisations (NGOs) can convince businesses of the
   directive's advantages by using playing down, mimicry and
   rationalisation as discursive legitimation strategies. These findings
   have major implications for debates on how to make the CSDDD effective
   in regulating business operations in the Global South.},

Abstract = {In recent years, scholars and activists have been asking queer questions
   about transitional justice. Queer perspectives advocate for the
   recognition of anti-queer violence within transitional justice; the
   inclusion of LGBTQIA+ people in transitional justice processes; and the
   development of queer decolonial critiques of transitional justice.
   Informed by this research agenda, I develop a queer perspective to the
   global governance of transitional justice. I analyse documents from the
   UN, the International Center for Transitional Justice and the
   International Criminal Court. Representing mechanisms from across global
   transitional justice, I trace the (cis-heteronormative, colonial,
   carceral) violence of transitional justice and its institutionalization
   at the global level. I reflect on the queer tensions and
   (im)possibilities of global transitional justice, a site that is violent
   but holds transformative potential. The global governance of
   transitional justice must be queered to expand its social, political and
   conceptual remit, and to seek more radical, liberatory worlds within and
   beyond formal justice mechanisms.},

Abstract = {The 2022 invasion of Ukraine tests the resilience of the authoritarian
   regime in Russia. Most of the elites showed their commitment to the
   autocrat by publicly supporting the ``special military operation{''}.
   However, the intensity of their support has varied across the ranks. By
   examining Russian governors. I propose that elites vary their
   communicative responses to the war strategically, depending on their
   personal considerations and the structural characteristics of their
   regions. I apply text-as-data methods to analyze gubernatorial posts on
   the social network VKontakte in 2022-2023. I find that governors up for
   election, outsiders, with weaker political standing, and from poorer
   regions communicate more support measures for combatants and their
   families, and humanitarian aid to the annexed territories, when
   discussing the war in Ukraine. Therefore, by co-opting war-affected
   groups and emphasizing performance legitimacy, governors minimize the
   threat of anti-regime mobilization without resorting to large-scale
   repression and contribute to authoritarian resilience.},

Abstract = {This article investigates legislators' willingness to talk about gender
   and women during policy making discussions, asking whether it is
   conditional on their sex or partisanship in environments where party
   discipline does not constrain their speech. The Canadian Senate offers a
   case of a legislature with low or absent party discipline. A
   quantitative content analysis of nearly 1,000 Senate committee meetings
   confirms that sex is a primary indicator of legislators' inclination to
   talk about gender and women. Moreover, women senators who sit on
   committees with a critical mass of women members (30\% or greater) are
   more likely to talk about gender and women, making the case for the
   importance of women's descriptive representation. Partisanship and
   independence had no significant effect on senators' propensity to
   discuss women. The findings suggest that partisanship does not constrain
   legislators' representation of women in environments with low party
   discipline.},

Abstract = {How have Central and Eastern European countries integrated into global
   production networks since the early 2000s? Have European Union
   accession, the Great Recession of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic
   significantly altered their export profiles? Using cluster analysis for
   11 economies between 2000 and 2021, we uncover persistent
   differentiation and deepening specialisation over time. Czechia,
   Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia emerge as the manufacturing hub of the
   region. When broader exports are accounted for, these economies look
   similar to Poland, Croatia and Romania. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and
   Bulgaria form a separate group that relies on more labour- and
   resource-intensive manufacturing goods, commodities and services.},

Abstract = {Chief Justice John Roberts is often called an ``institutionalist,{''}
   indicating that he places the good of the Supreme Court as a governing
   institution over his own political preferences. This description is true
   only to a limited extent. The historical institutionalist analysis
   presented here shows that Roberts's priority is to advance his version
   of the modern conservative legal movement's vision of the Constitution,
   and that he protects the judiciary as an institution in the service of
   that cause. But because many Americans do not share that vision of
   constitutionalism, and because its endorsement of executive power may
   undermine judicial authority, the decisions of the Roberts court may
   only compound the difficulties facing both the court and the country
   today. I also discuss implications of the Chief Justice's disposition,
   both for the court and for the nation's evolving conception of
   constitutionalism.},

Abstract = {The European Union's (EU's) `geoeconomic turn' denotes the growing
   integration of international security considerations into EU economic
   policies. This article introduces the concept of `geoeconomic power
   Europe' to show how this development has the potential to renew debates
   on the nature of EU power. Most existing conceptualisations of EU power
   - whether characterised as civilian, normative, market based, regulatory
   or liberal - tend to focus on the EU's endogenous characteristics.
   However, the added value of the concept of geoeconomic power is that it
   redirects attention to the `co-constitution' loop between global power
   competition and the evolution of EU power. In this article, I present an
   analytical framework that highlights the drivers of EU geoeconomic power
   and distinguishes between systemic pressures, the intra-EU policy
   process and the impact on EU power. I conclude that the concept of
   geoeconomic power Europe can help to bridge theories of international
   security and economic interdependence, particularly neorealism and
   neofunctionalism.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Examine the diverse actions, including urban planning and
   public-private collaboration, that Barcelona City Council has
   implemented to guarantee the right to access to adequate and decent
   housing. Methodology: Descriptive work. Results: Although, in the
   Spanish legal system, competence in housing matters corresponds
   exclusively to the Autonomous Communities, the City Councils have a
   basic and fundamental role in the management and promotion of the right
   to housing. For example, Barcelona City Council has promoted different
   mechanisms such as land reservation on consolidated urban land
   orcohousing. Conclusions: The Public Administration needs to implement a
   global policy to increase the supply of public housing. This policy must
   be characterized, especially, by strong and stable economic investment,
   by the configuration of a clear and secure legal framework and by the
   implementation of collaboration measures between the different
   Administrations and between the Administration and the private sector.},

Abstract = {Truth and reconciliation commissioners face the challenge of
   establishing legitimacy with survivors, victims and broader society,
   determining a way forward that will have longterm transformative impacts
   and completing their mandates. In this article, the author suggests ways
   for truth and reconciliation commissioners to ethically design
   activities around survivors voicing their experiences, creating space
   for management of fear, ethical learning, remembering and resurgence of
   epistemic resources. To do so, she engages with the work of several
   relational philosophers to propose areas of attention for newly
   appointed commissioners as they begin their work. How we understand
   memory, epistemic injustice, ethical fearing and calling in instead of
   calling out all lead the author to suggest that care around the design
   of processes around testimony, listening, sharing and responding will
   have the potential for transformation through the Truth and
   Reconciliation Commission's activities.},

Abstract = {Several recent studies have shown that the emotion of contempt, which is
   often linked to negative appraisals of competence and integrity, is the
   most important negative emotion in some electoral contests. Furthermore,
   gender-based stereotypes and prejudice have been shown to cause voters
   to evaluate female candidates in ways that seem contemptuous, i.e. as
   inferior and having undesirable traits. In this study, we analyze how
   sexism and gender-based prejudices may influence voters' emotions
   (especially their levels of contempt) in response to female political
   candidates in general and to those who violate gender norms. We find
   strong differences in emotional responses between sexist and nonsexist
   voters.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines the complex connections between human
   security and livelihoods in relation to development in the Niger Delta
   of Nigeria. This region is pervaded by a web of socio-economic and
   environmental issues that have severely impacted the lives of people and
   communities due to environmental degradation. For example, the
   exploration and exploitation of natural resources in this region has had
   extensive consequences on the livelihood activities of the people.
   Moreover, the Niger Delta has been affected by persistent social
   instabilities and a lack of access to some of the basic assets of
   security, including personal, health, economic and environmental
   security. While the concepts of livelihoods and environmental
   degradation are reasonably well understood in the context of the Niger
   Delta, the complex links between them in relation to human security
   remain unexplored. To examine how environmental degradation impacts
   livelihoods, this article explores the concept of human security,
   following a rights-based approach in line with the sustainable
   livelihood framework. Furthermore, it draws from semi-structured
   interviews conducted in the region on the lived experiences of community
   members, such as farmers and fishers, and their challenges in bridging
   generational crises in the context of environmental degradation. I argue
   that understanding the interconnectedness of security and livelihood
   issues in the context of such crises provides an innovative approach to
   considering both environmental and social factors in sustainable
   development, which is essential for the overall well-being of people in
   the region.},

Abstract = {Nicaragua has followed an unusual path from democracy to
   authoritarianism. In 2000, despite deep political polarization, outgoing
   Liberal president Arnoldo Alem \& aacute;n colluded with opposition
   leader Daniel Ortega to convert politically neutral judicial and
   electoral institutions into partisan tools. Their pact constrained the
   party system and lowered the electoral threshold, enabling Ortega to win
   the presidency in 2006. From a minority position in the legislature,
   Ortega's Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) party used the
   politicized judiciary and electoral infrastructure to remove
   presidential term limits and manipulate elections. After gaining a
   legislative majority, the FSLN then reformed the constitution to
   consolidate power. Public resistance to democratic decline came slowly
   and too late: Initially offset by social spending funded in part by
   international authoritarian allies, it was ultimately repressed. The
   Nicaragua case shows that a gradualist pathway toward democratic
   backsliding may be available to minority parties in poor countries.},

   the situation of North Korean defectors on the ground and with regard to

Abstract = {Indigenous peoples have been struggling worldwide to have their rights
   recognized. Despite relevant legal advances, such as the Declaration on
   the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007), the implementation gap between
   the adoption of international standards by States and their compliance
   still remains. This article relies on empirical examples from
   Interactive Dialogues (ID) with the Special Rapporteur on the Rights of
   Indigenous Peoples (SRIP) and the Expert Mechanism on the Right of
   Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP), held between 2011 and 2021 in the Human
   Rights Council sessions, to exemplify how these struggles also become
   noticeable in the public and global arenas. It highlights the emblematic
   case of conflicting narratives between Indigenous peoples and the
   Brazilian State in 2020, when the latter strategically used
   `misunderstandings' to delegitimize Indigenous peoples' claims. It
   concludes that the underlying challenge in the implementation of
   Indigenous peoples' rights rests in ontological conflicts between States
   and Indigenous peoples, especially concerning the meaning of
   self-determination. These struggles are reflected in the disputing of
   narratives in the UN human rights arenas, and have been shaping
   interpretations of Indigenous peoples' rights that privilege a
   perspective antagonistic to them. The article provides some
   practice-oriented recommendations for reducing discourse manipulation at
   the HRC.},

Abstract = {The European defence market can be described as a geoeconomically
   relevant sector that forms part of Europe's overall economy, not least
   in the way that it is a producer of military capabilities and
   technologies and a repository of scientific skills. Traditionally,
   European Union (EU)-level steps to support and liberalise the sector
   have reflected a regulatory approach marked by soft law, but in recent
   years, the EU has also developed financial tools to incentivise defence
   co-operation. Looking specifically at the European Defence Fund (EDF),
   this article views this transition as evidence of a `geoeconomic turn'
   in European defence market policy that is a response to structural
   challenges related to technology control, security of supply and
   geopolitical competition. Employing relative gains theory and liberal
   intergovernmentalism, this article charts the transition from market
   liberalisation to industrial policy in EU defence market initiatives
   based on specific intra- and extra-political dynamics.},

Abstract = {It is easy to discern an inherently optimistic outlook in much of the
   COVID-19 literature. The pandemic perhaps represents an opportunity to
   redesign the existing parameters of society or even initiate new forms
   of the social contract. This article seeks to examine to what extent,
   and in which ways, post-pandemic official political agenda-setting
   realistically reflects these hopes. Through a comprehensive conceptual
   framework consisting of ethical, pragmatic, contractual and temporal
   sets of notions, the article analyses post-pandemic governmental
   programmes and prime ministers' speeches in six European countries,
   paying attention to general descriptions of the world, issues of
   security in the context of multiculturalism, as well as work and
   resilience. The article's main argument contends that similarities
   prevail across the countries, implying a functionally shared European
   polity informed by a general crisis modus, but these similarities do not
   contain any profound transformative elements with regard to future
   policies or societal developments.},

   initiatives in Indonesia and Singapore},

Abstract = {Despite considerable skepticism, private climate governance initiatives
   leveraging transnational voluntary standards have grown exponentially in
   the twenty-first century. Our paper explains this continued
   proliferation, particularly in areas beyond core global financial
   centers. While functionalists view private climate governance as arising
   out of the polycentric nature of contemporary global governance,
   critical political economists view it as a function of a global shift
   towards neoliberal environmental governance. However, the adoption of
   global governance instruments and neoliberal market policies are often
   selective and coupled to the objectives of elite groups. To evidence
   this dynamic, we pursue a study of private climate initiatives in
   Indonesia and Singapore to illuminate the structural conditions and
   social forces driving their proliferation. We find that private climate
   governance initiatives are being harnessed by domestic, but increasingly
   internationalized, fractions of capital for transnational conglomerate
   expansion out of Indonesia, and for post-industrial economic growth to
   buttress party-state rule in Singapore, respectively. Private
   initiatives are being used to consolidate and expand the political and
   economic power of entrenched domestic elites whose interests and agendas
   have hampered transformative climate policy change in their respective
   countries.},

Abstract = {This article explores Latvia's continued use of citizenship requirements
   and language policies as forms of transitional justice to redress
   vestiges of the Soviet past. This article presents an original
   1,000-person survey conducted in June 2023 of Latvian residents'
   attitudes toward these measures, which have been on-going for more than
   30 years and have been amplified following Russia's war in Ukraine.
   Despite the connections made between Russia's war in Ukraine and
   potential domestic security threats from resident Russophones and
   Soviet-era migrants, there was only moderate agreement that transitional
   justice measures were needed to redress lingering problems of the past.
   There was lukewarm support for the use of measures to address corruption
   linked to lingering Soviet-era networks. Instead, respondents
   overwhelmingly thought the government should focus more on solving
   current problems than on dealing with the consequences of Soviet-era
   injustices. Within these trends, divisions emerged between Latvian and
   ethnic Russians, raising concerns that elongated measures could
   exacerbate political polarization along socioeconomic and ethnic lines.
   Generational responses yielded some unexpected results, with the
   youngest cohort more supportive of continued retributive measures than
   older cohorts. The survey findings suggest the utility and resonance of
   these measures might have run their course, and worse, that they could
   even exacerbate societal divisions.},

   in the psychosocial welfare environment},
Journal = {GLOBAL DISCOURSE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 16},
Abstract = {Occupational health research shows that work is no better for health and
   well-being than its work environment and employment conditions. Yet, the
   assumption that work is health promoting as well as rehabilitating is
   central in social insurance and labour market measures. Based on
   occupational health research and theories of motivation and stress,
   Basic Income is discussed here as a resource that motivates and enables
   further resource gain and protects against stress and related illnesses,
   such as depression and exhaustion. Applying research and theories from
   occupational health research to the demands and resources in what is
   here labelled the `psychosocial welfare environment' elucidates the
   effects of the conditionality and means testing of different welfare
   measures, as well as those of Basic Income in various experiments, on
   health, well-being and labour market participation. The difference
   between ethical and evidence-based arguments concerning Basic Income is
   discussed from the perspective of the workfare society, where the
   evidence-based effects of unconditionality meet ideological convictions
   concerning poverty and the myth of the work cure.},

Abstract = {`Convergence' stands out as a prominent signifier in discourse about the
   European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), recently also gaining
   prominence in debates within Comparative Political Economy (CPE) studies
   on the Eurozone crisis. However, these studies neglect the concept's
   endogenous deployment in EMU discourse and, therefore, how it influences
   capitalist restructuring efforts within it. This article tackles the
   latter by providing a critical policy discourse analysis of key texts
   throughout the Union's history, linking the use of the term to the
   institutional development of the EMU. By doing so, not only does it
   identify the concept's constitutive discursive role as a frame and
   problem of monetary integration, but it also showcases its limitations
   from a CPE perspective, specifically by combining insights from the
   aforementioned studies with those of Europeanisation research and by
   subsequently criticising the neoclassical and neofunctionalist
   assumptions guiding `convergence' efforts in EMU.},

Title = {Beyond Security: The Compliance Dimension of National Security Reviews
   in Singapore and Taiwan},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 9},
Abstract = {Growing concerns over Chinese investment have spurred stricter national
   security reviews globally, yet compliance and enforcement within these
   reviews remain understudied. This paper examines the enforcement
   mechanisms of national security review in Singapore and Taiwan, key
   trade partners with China. It contrasts Singapore's emphasis on rigorous
   ex post monitoring with Taiwan's focus on restrictive ex ante screening.
   To strengthen public enforcement, Singapore relies on privatized
   monitoring while Taiwan incorporates private enforcement. This study
   argues that robust state oversight through public enforcement is
   critical for compliance, but underscores the importance of extending
   enforcement beyond the initial investment stage to include post-entry
   monitoring. Additionally, incorporating market intermediaries as
   enforcement agents presents a promising approach. This comparative
   analysis contributes to a richer understanding of national security
   review enforcement beyond traditional US-centric framework.},

Title = {The Ukrainian Gambit: The Sacking of LH Mel'nykov and the Post-Stalin
   Succession},
Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 31},
Abstract = {A culminating moment in the post-Stalin struggle for power was the
   abrupt removal in May 1953 of the Ukrainian party boss Leonid Mel'nykov.
   With no clear succession procedure in place, the main contenders, Beria
   and Khrushchev, grasped for control over the institutions that might
   provide them a crucial advantage. Mel'nykov's sacking became a focus of
   speculation in Cold War Kremlinology, viewed as a fatal political error
   by Beria. Utilising more recently available archival sources and the
   current scholarship of Soviet patronage politics and nationality policy,
   this article reassesses the clash over the Ukrainian SSR and the likely
   motivations of the primary actors.},

   patterns},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 15},
Abstract = {Populism is often assumed to undermine the liberal world order, but this
   claim has never been tested systematically. In this study, we do so for
   the first time. Based on an understanding of populism as a
   ``thin-centered ideology{''} entailing anti-elitism and people-centrism,
   we expect populist governments to have foreign policy preferences
   opposed to the core features of the US-led liberal international order.
   Our empirical analysis assesses government preferences on the liberal
   international order as expressed through UN General Assembly votes. Our
   findings support the expectation that populism has a strong and
   statistically significant negative impact on foreign policy preferences
   related to the core norms of the liberal international order. Moreover,
   we find that populists with a left-wing ideology and those in less
   democratic countries tend to be more opposed to the US-led liberal
   international order. However, populist governments do not reject the
   UNGA as such, as they are not more likely to be absent from UNGA votes
   than other states. Thereby, this study makes a contribution both to the
   burgeoning literature on the international implications of populism and
   to debates on the crisis of the liberal order.},

Abstract = {Election violence is increasingly taking place online. However, we still
   do not know much about how such attacks affect the representation of
   politically marginalized groups such as women. This article develops and
   applies strategies for analyzing (gendered) exposure to and impacts of
   online attacks against political candidates. It focuses on the 2019
   parliamentary election campaign in Tunisia and combines manual analysis
   of Tunisian candidates' public Facebook pages with candidate interviews.
   We find no gendered patterns in exposure to online election violence in
   the Facebook data and a low general exposure to attacks. The interview
   data nevertheless suggests gendered perceptions and impacts of attacks,
   as well as a perception among the candidates that online election
   violence is widespread and problematic. These discrepancies highlight
   that we need a combination of methods and materials to capture the
   multifaceted nature of online election violence, and in particular those
   that directly link candidate exposure to impact.},

Title = {Leader ideology and state commitment to multilateral treaties},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 23},
Abstract = {The existing literature argues that the left is generally more
   supportive of multilateralism in foreign policy than the right. However,
   the impact of ideology on state commitment to multilateral cooperation
   have not yet been empirically tested adequately. We assess the presence
   of such a left-right divide on state commitment to multilateral treaties
   employing an original dataset, containing all the available information
   about the ratification of the multilateral treaties deposited with the
   UN Secretary General since 1945. Our results indicate that indeed
   countries led by left-wing leaders are generally faster at ratifying
   treaties than those led by right-wing leaders. However, the association
   between leader ideology and commitment to multilateral treaties is
   substantially conditioned by regime type and the international context.
   In fact, we find robust evidence of a significant gap in ratification
   duration between states led by left-wing and right-wing leaders in
   democracies but not in other regime types, and during the Cold War but
   not after. Through such findings, this article provides a contribution
   to the debate on the impact of ideology on international relations and
   the drivers of global support for multilateralism.},

   the 2020 US Presidential Election},
Journal = {POLITICS \& GENDER},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 20},
Abstract = {Due to the concern about relatively small samples, it has been
   conventional in previous research to analyze women voters together as a
   group. However, viewing women as a monolith results in `whitewashing,'
   obscuring variation at the intersection of race and gender in partisan
   vote choice. Utilizing the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-election
   Survey (CMPS), we disaggregate women voters by race and ethnicity and
   analyze the significance of a host of factors that contribute to
   partisan vote choice, with particular attention to the role of attitudes
   about race (i.e., ``racial resentment{''}) and gender (i.e., ``hostile
   sexism{''}) on support for Donald Trump in 2020. Our analyses
   demonstrate how intersectional positionality of race and gender together
   conditions how standard explanatory measures as well as attitudes about
   gender and race vary across women voters who are Black, Asian American,
   Latina, and white in their support for United States presidential
   candidates.},

Abstract = {The intersection of the International Monetary System (IMS) and
   ecological degradation and social inequality remains, despite some
   excellent examples, a relatively underexplored area. This paper draws
   upon the literature to argue that an ecological currency hierarchy (ECH)
   describes how a hierarchy of currencies grants Core countries
   considerable autonomy over their economic direction while Periphery
   countries are subject to conditions in the Core. As capital continuously
   seeks returns, Core economies can sell debt regardless of global
   economic circumstances, while the Periphery may only do so when returns
   in the Core are high and risk tolerance is high. When conditions in the
   Core offer low returns on investment, foreign direct investment floods
   into the Periphery driving up their debt levels and material extraction.
   This structural debt/material extraction dynamic is a function of having
   a non-Core currency and leaves Periphery countries unable to engage in
   long-term, autonomous economic planning. We conduct econometric analyses
   using World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and International
   Resource Panel data to confirm that having a Core currency increases
   demand for debt and lowers material extraction, while also confirming
   that rates of return on investment in the Core drive foreign direct
   investment, debt, and material extraction in the Periphery.},

Abstract = {Freedom of information (FOI) laws empower citizens to access public
   information from public organizations, enhancing government transparency
   and accountability. Previous studies have evaluated government
   transparency and FOI compliance based on the proactive release of
   information and governments' responses to citizens' requests. This study
   extends prior research by focusing on regulatory compliance mechanisms
   in German public organizations. Specifically, it investigates how these
   organizations respond to information requests under varying legislative
   frameworks across Germany's 16 states (L \& auml;nder). Based on six
   legal elements (de jure provisions), we examine FOI law stringency and
   investigate their association with government responsiveness to
   approximate de facto regulatory compliance. Based on an analysis of over
   100,000 requests directed at more than 7000 German public sector
   organizations, we find that not all six legal elements are directly
   associated with responsiveness. Only those elements that signify a
   broader organizational commitment to transparency are linked to higher
   responsiveness. This study contributes to public sector transparency
   literature by highlighting the complex interplay between variations in
   FOI laws and actual compliance, and underscores the need for further
   research on the assumed causal relationship between FOI law stringency
   and transparency outcomes.},

Abstract = {This article explores bottom-up responses to the Kremlin's approach to
   nation-building in a multi-ethnic state. How do residents of ethnically
   mixed cities navigate conflicting themes of unity and diversity in the
   federal discourse of Russia as a multi-ethnic nation (mnogonatsional'nyi
   narod)? This discourse runs counter to assimilative policies and a
   concurrent vision of Russia as a civilisation rooted in Slavic culture.
   In the diverse city of Kazan, the discourse is shown to be easily
   adopted by residents in narrating belonging, while being a problematic
   basis for nation-building. The discussion highlights the importance of
   regional and ethnic subject positions in bottom-up engagement with
   nation-building in Russia.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, public health researchers have been advancing the
   Intersectionality-Based Policy Analysis (IBPA) framework to examine
   differential impacts of health policy. This article extends an
   equity-oriented policy agenda by applying the IBPA framework to three
   domains of the criminal justice system: policing, corrections, and
   legislation. I present case studies of algorithmic policing, the housing
   of transgender persons in carceral settings, and U.S. firearm
   legislation as examples of this approach. Through these cases, I argue
   for equitable processes and outcomes in the creation and application of
   criminal justice policy and practice.},

   Twin Earth},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},

Abstract = {A growing body of literature studies how expert practices constitute
   issues such as climate change, migration, or public health as
   international objects of expertise. The article contributes to this
   research agenda by highlighting the role of digital visual technologies
   and infrastructures in the constitution and governance of these
   international objects. It develops the concept of visual objects and
   uses it to trace and explain the emergence of a new technological
   initiative conducted by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the EU: the
   vision of a `digital twin Earth' (DTE). The idea behind the DTE is to
   combine various technologies, including satellite Earth observation,
   advanced computer models, and AI, to build a digital replica of our
   planet and thereby govern risks emanating from environmental changes and
   other global challenges. The article provides a first analysis of the
   international politics of the DTE. It shows how the visual object of the
   DTE functions as an attractor of heterogeneous actors and practices
   involved in the European space policy field thereby temporarily
   stabilizing this complex assemblage. Finally, it traces how the DTE and
   its machinic ways of seeing enact the Earth not only as an object of
   knowledge but also as one of experimentation and intervention.
   Au sein de la litt \& eacute;rature, un nombre croissant de travaux \&
   eacute;tudient la fa \& ccedil;on dont les pratiques d'experts
   envisagent certaines probl \& eacute;matiques (changement climatique,
   migrations, sant \& eacute; publique, etc.) comme des sujets d'expertise
   internationaux. L'article contribue \& agrave; ce programme de recherche
   en soulignant le r \& ocirc;le des technologies et infrastructures
   visuelles num \& eacute;riques dans la constitution et la gouvernance de
   ces objets internationaux. Il d \& eacute;veloppe le concept d'objets
   visuels avant de l'employer pour retracer et expliquer l'apparition
   d'une nouvelle initiative technologique men \& eacute;e par l'Agence
   spatiale europ \& eacute;enne (ESA) et l'UE : la vision d'un << jumeau
   num \& eacute;rique de la Terre >> (JNT). L'id \& eacute;e qui se cache
   derri \& egrave;re le JNT est de combiner diff \& eacute;rentes
   technologies, y compris l'observation de la Terre par satellite, les mod
   \& egrave;les informatiques avanc \& eacute;s et l'IA, pour construire
   une copie num \& eacute;rique de notre plan \& egrave;te, et ainsi contr
   \& ocirc;ler les risques issus des modifications de l'environnement et
   d'autres d \& eacute;fis mondiaux. L'article pr \& eacute;sente une
   premi \& egrave;re analyse de la politique internationale du jumeau num
   \& eacute;rique de la Terre. Il montre que le JNT, en tant qu'objet
   visuel, attire des acteurs et pratiques h \& eacute;t \& eacute;rog \&
   egrave;nes dans le champ de la politique spatiale europ \& eacute;enne,
   et donc stabilise temporairement cet assemblage complexe. Enfin, il
   montre que le JNT et ses modes de vision machiniques repr \&
   eacute;sentent la Terre comme un objet de savoir, mais aussi comme un
   objet d'exp \& eacute;rimentation et d'intervention.
   Existe una creciente parte de la literatura que estudia c \& oacute;mo
   las pr \& aacute;cticas de expertos construyen temas como el cambio clim
   \& aacute;tico, la migraci \& oacute;n o la salud p \& uacute;blica
   caracteriz \& aacute;ndolos como objetos internacionales de experiencia.
   Este art \& iacute;culo contribuye a esta agenda de investigaci \&
   oacute;n destacando el papel de las tecnolog \& iacute;as e
   infraestructuras visuales digitales en la constituci \& oacute;n y
   gobernanza de estos objetos internacionales. El art \& iacute;culo
   desarrolla el concepto de objetos visuales y lo utiliza para seguir la
   pista y explicar el surgimiento de una nueva iniciativa tecnol \&
   oacute;gica llevada a cabo por la Agencia Espacial Europea (ESA, por sus
   siglas en ingl \& eacute;s) y la UE: la visi \& oacute;n de un ``gemelo
   digital de la Tierra{''} (DTE, por sus siglas en ingl \& eacute;s). La
   idea detr \& aacute;s del DTE consiste en combinar varias tecnolog \&
   iacute;as, incluyendo la observaci \& oacute;n satelital de la Tierra,
   modelos inform \& aacute;ticos avanzados e inteligencia artificial, con
   el fin de construir una r \& eacute;plica digital de nuestro planeta y,
   por lo tanto, de gobernar los riesgos que emanan de los cambios
   ambientales y de otros desaf \& iacute;os globales. El art \&
   iacute;culo ofrece un primer an \& aacute;lisis de la pol \& iacute;tica
   internacional de este gemelo digital de la Tierra. El art \& iacute;culo
   muestra c \& oacute;mo el objeto visual del DTE funciona como un
   atractor de agentes y de pr \& aacute;cticas heterog \& eacute;neas en
   el \& aacute;mbito de la pol \& iacute;tica espacial europea, que
   estabiliza, as \& iacute;, temporalmente este complejo ensamblaje. Por
   \& uacute;ltimo, el art \& iacute;culo esboza c \& oacute;mo el DTE y
   sus formas maqu \& iacute;nicas de ver representan a la Tierra no solo
   como un objeto de conocimiento sino tambi \& eacute;n como un objeto de
   experimentaci \& oacute;n e intervenci \& oacute;n.},

Title = {From Security-Space to Time-Race: Reimagining Borders and Migration in
   Global Politics},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 22},
Abstract = {In an apparent departure from responses to the so-called 2015
   ``migration{''} crisis, Ukrainians displaced by the war have been
   welcomed relatively unbureaucratically by European states. Yet, despite
   this, they are positioned as a problem to be solved, a disruption to the
   normal order and state system. This article asks what this
   problematization of ``migrants{''} reveals about the dominant system of
   thought that assigns people to place and how it might it be possible to
   think beyond its limits. It starts by demonstrating that the
   ``security-space{''} imaginary both excludes and relies upon highly
   problematic, concealed assumptions about time and race. It shows how
   questions of time and race continually haunt and disrupt the seemingly
   coherent and indomitable ``security-space{''} way of thinking. Following
   a strategy of deconstruction, the article arrives at the
   counter-intuitive conclusion that this dominant problematization of
   migration is temporal and structured by a relation to the future.
   Building on existing critical literature produced by scholars of
   Geopolitics, International Relations, and International Political
   Sociology, it offers an alternative imaginary, ``time-race,{''} which
   opens up new ground for reimagining borders and migration to overcome
   reproducing the never-ending cycle of ``migration crises,{''} to which
   there is apparently no alternative.
   En contradiction apparente par rapport aux r \& eacute;ponses \& agrave;
   la << crise migratoire >> de 2015, l'accueil des Ukrainiens d \&
   eacute;plac \& eacute;s \& agrave; cause de la guerre s'est d \&
   eacute;roul \& eacute; avec relativement peu de bureaucratie dans les \&
   Eacute;tats europ \& eacute;ens. Pourtant, on les consid \& egrave;re
   comme un probl \& egrave;me \& agrave; r \& eacute;soudre, une
   perturbation de l'ordre normal et du syst \& egrave;me \&
   eacute;tatique. Cet article s'interroge sur ce que laisse transpara \&
   icirc;tre cette probl \& eacute;matisation des << migrants >> au sujet
   du syst \& egrave;me de pens \& eacute;e dominant qui attribue une place
   aux gens, et sur les possibilit \& eacute;s de d \& eacute;passement de
   ses limites. D'abord, il d \& eacute;montre que l'imaginaire << espace-s
   \& eacute;curit \& eacute; >> exclut des hypoth \& egrave;ses dissimul
   \& eacute;es et extr \& ecirc;mement probl \& eacute;matiques quant au
   temps et \& agrave; la race tout en en d \& eacute;pendant. Il montre
   que les questions de temps et de race obs \& egrave;dent et perturbent
   constamment le mode de pens \& eacute;e << espace-s \& eacute;curit \&
   eacute; >>, a priori coh \& eacute;rent et invincible. En suivant une
   strat \& eacute;gie de d \& eacute;construction, l'article arrive \&
   agrave; une conclusion contre-intuitive : cette probl \&
   eacute;matisation dominante de la migration est temporelle et structur
   \& eacute;e par une relation avec le futur. En se fondant sur les litt
   \& eacute;ratures critiques existantes des chercheurs en g \&
   eacute;opolitique, relations internationales et sociologie politique
   internationale, il propose un autre imaginaire, << race-temps >>, qui
   offre de nouvelles possibilit \& eacute;s de repenser les fronti \&
   egrave;res et la migration. Ainsi, l'on \& eacute;viterait de reproduire
   l'\& eacute;ternel cycle de << crises migratoires >>, auquel il n'y
   aurait apparemment aucune alternative.
   Los ucranianos desplazados por la guerra han sido recibidos de forma
   relativamente poco burocr \& aacute;tica por los Estados europeos, lo
   que supone un aparente alejamiento de las respuestas a la llamada crisis
   ``migratoria{''} de 2015. Sin embargo, y a pesar de esto, se encuentran
   posicionados como un problema a resolver, una alteraci \& oacute;n del
   orden normal y del Estado-sistema. En este art \& iacute;culo nos
   preguntamos qu \& eacute; es lo que revela esta problematizaci \&
   oacute;n de los << migrantes >> sobre el sistema de pensamiento
   dominante, el cual asigna un lugar a las personas, y c \& oacute;mo podr
   \& iacute;a ser posible pensar m \& aacute;s all \& aacute; de sus l \&
   iacute;mites. El art \& iacute;culo comienza demostrando que el
   imaginario << seguridad-espacio >> excluye y se basa en supuestos
   altamente problem \& aacute;ticos y ocultos relacionados con el tiempo y
   con la raza. A continuaci \& oacute;n, demuestra c \& oacute;mo las
   cuestiones del tiempo y la raza acechan y perturban continuamente la
   forma de pensar, aparentemente coherente e indomable, del imaginario
   ``seguridad-espacio.{''} El art \& iacute;culo sigue una estrategia de
   deconstrucci \& oacute;n y llega a la conclusi \& oacute;n
   contraintuitiva de que esta problematizaci \& oacute;n dominante de la
   migraci \& oacute;n es temporal y que est \& aacute; estructurada por
   una relaci \& oacute;n con el futuro. Partiendo de la base de la
   literatura cr \& iacute;tica existente, producida por estudiosos de la
   Geopol \& iacute;tica, las Relaciones Internacionales y la Sociolog \&
   iacute;a Pol \& iacute;tica Internacional, el art \& iacute;culo ofrece
   un imaginario alternativo, << tiempo-raza >>, que abre un nuevo camino
   para reimaginar las fronteras y la migraci \& oacute;n con el fin de
   intentar superar la reproducci \& oacute;n del ciclo interminable de
   ``crisis migratorias{''} para el que, aparentemente, no existe
   alternativa.},

Abstract = {Cracks in the liberal international order (LIO) have been occurring
   since its very formation. Yet, some international relations scholarship
   frames the narrative about imminent threats to the LIO as if such
   threats were new. From a postcolonial vantage point, this essay contends
   that mainstream theorizing about international order is problematically
   Eurocentric and develops a three-pronged argument. In the first place,
   the essay argues for understanding order as a command or as an
   imposition. Order as a command renders visible power disparities,
   injustices, and inequalities of the international order as seen by
   actors from below. Second, the essay leans on Edward Said's contrapuntal
   reading method to show that experiences of order are plural rather than
   singular or universal. Third, the essay argues that from a postcolonial
   perspective, the opposite of order is not chaos or volatility but rather
   agency or the authorship to be a rule maker. A full picture of order as
   imposition requires understanding how togetherness and sameness are
   modes for Global South actors to find collective unity to resist the
   injustices and inequalities of the LIO.},

Abstract = {The discourse of tragedy has significant value in a military context,
   reminding us of the temptations of hubris, the prevalence of moral
   dilemmas, and the inescapable limits of foresight. Today, however, this
   discourse is drawn upon too heavily. Within the tragicized politics of
   nuclear and drone violence, foreseeable and solvable problems are
   reconceptualized as intractable dilemmas, and morally accountable agents
   are reframed as powerless observers. The tragedy discourse, when wrongly
   applied by policymakers and the media, indulges the very hubris the
   tragic recognition is intended to caution against. This article
   clarifies the limits of ``tragedy{''} in the context of military
   violence and argues for a renewed focus on political responsibility.},

Abstract = {Donald Trump and Trumpism have transformed the Heritage Foundation and
   the Federalist Society, two institutions at the heart of the
   conservative legal movement. In this article, I use the conservative
   philosophy of fusionism as a lens for understanding the causes and
   consequences of the transformation. The original fusionism of William F.
   Buckley and Frank S. Meyer brought disparate factions of conservatives
   together under the mantle of libertarian means to conservative ends.
   Here, I show that Trump and Trumpism have transmogrified that original
   concept into a ``new fusionism{''} of authoritarian means to Christian
   nationalist ends. I investigate the extent to which this ``new
   fusionism{''} has been embraced or endorsed by the Heritage Foundation
   and the Federalist Society and what the consequences might be for the
   respectability and efficacy of the conservative legal movement after
   Trump.},

Abstract = {The current Supreme Court's jurisprudence on issues of executive power
   differs markedly depending on the precise type of executive power in
   question. Although generally taking an expansive view of presidential
   power, it often seeks to narrow the authority of executive branch
   administrative agencies, especially those engaged in regulation. This
   contrast creates an appearance of inconsistency: At the same time that
   the court is expanding presidential power, it is pulling back on
   administrative action and thereby denying the presidency one of its most
   important sources of authority. But the court's approach is more
   coherent if it is understood as aimed at implementation of a
   conservative legal and political agenda. Moreover, by both expanding
   presidential powers and limiting administrative authority, the court's
   decisions aggrandize judicial power at the expense of the political
   branches.},

Abstract = {The global financial crisis in 2007 and, more recently, the Covid-19
   pandemic renewed interest in capitalist divergence and the evolution of
   growth models in the Eurozone. The varieties of capitalism (VoC)
   approach and more recently post-Keynesian research, especially the
   growth model (GM) perspective, have made important contributions to
   comparative political economy. However, the focus on either the
   `supply-side' or `demand-side' aspects of modern models of capitalism
   has offered a limited framework to explain capitalist diversity in the
   global economy. This article brings insights from both the VoC and GM
   perspectives and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the
   evolution of the growth models in Greece and Portugal. The argument is
   that although both countries implemented internal devaluation and
   contractionary policies to curtail domestic demand and transform their
   economies into export-led ones, they have been stuck in a suppressed
   demand-led growth model since the global financial crisis.},

Journal = {JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {62},

Abstract = {The European Union's (EU) regulatory power is an increasing focus of
   scholarly attention, but the lack of a consistent definition leaves room
   for refinement. Studies investigating the EU's role as a global
   regulatory actor yield different interpretations, some viewing the EU as
   a global market regulator, some as a power residing in the
   trade-regulatory nexus and others as a law-making entity that creates
   widely emulated rules. This article refines the definition of the EU's
   regulatory power by presenting a conceptual framework for better
   understanding the EU's regulatory actorness, encompassing its ends and
   means as a general regulator and/or a regulatory power. Using the
   proposed framework to analyse the transfer of EU geographical indication
   (GI) rules to Japan, this study finds that the EU's regulatory power is
   particularly conditioned on the interest constellation between the EU
   and a third country. Regarding the EU's goal of exercising regulatory
   power, interest promotion seems to take priority over rule exporting or
   norm sharing.},

Title = {Constitutionalizing dissent: The universe of opposition rules in African
   constitutions},
Journal = {GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 11},
Abstract = {Constitutions are the most important legal foundation of politics. At
   the same time, the existence of a viable parliamentary opposition has
   been regarded one of the most distinctive characteristics of democracy.
   Bringing the two perspectives together, the principle of opposition can
   be constitutionalized to gain the highest status. Importantly, we refer
   to norms recognizing the opposition as such. Such counter-majoritarian
   rules are distinct because they empower opposition forces irrespective
   of their seat share and explicitly acknowledge that power should not be
   monopolized. While our subject has attracted little interest from
   comparative constitutionalists, it is too important to be overlooked.
   This is particularly true for autocratizing regimes where incumbents
   seek to use legislative lawfare to repress their opponents. Empirically,
   the study focuses on Africa, which proves revealing for various reasons.
   Among others, it addresses the critique that constitutional law studies
   often concentrate on usual suspect cases used to reveal purportedly
   universal insights. Our exercise in comparative constitutional law leads
   to two main conclusions that go beyond the continent. First, while we
   find a high number of opposition-related rules, the variation in design
   details and scope suggests that referring to the principle of opposition
   in an abstract manner is somewhat obscuring. And second, the obvious
   virtues of constitutionalizing dissent face noteworthy pitfalls since
   pertinent rules can lack legal clarity and even suppress dissent. Hence,
   the dividends of nominally democratic rules might be smaller than
   expected even if constitutional designers sincerely intend to fully
   uphold them in practice.},

Abstract = {Corruption is a ubiquitous problem, but implementing serious
   anti-corruption measures is politically hard - the backlash from the
   corrupt is certain, but the broader political benefits are uncertain.
   Consequently, reformers face a dilemma in that even if they can pass
   reforms, it is not clear that the public will notice or reward them. To
   date, we have limited evidence on whether citizens notice
   anti-corruption reforms, how such reforms shape corruption perceptions,
   and whether there are real political benefits to reformers. In this
   article, we exploit a quasi-experiment embedded in the rollout of
   traffic police reform in Ukraine following the Euromaidan Revolution of
   2013-14 to address each of these issues in turn. We find that citizens
   do respond quite accurately and durably in their evaluations of the most
   immediately affected institutions, but the spillovers to other political
   institutions are limited, short-lived, and offer little electoral gain.},

Abstract = {Building on the existing literature on business power that has evolved
   against the background of a liberal economic world order, this article
   develops a novel analytical framework to capture business strategies in
   an altered, geoeconomic context. It addresses the research question
   whether and how business power has been affected by the more recent turn
   of European policy-makers to adopt geoeconomic measures in response to
   external geopoliticising pressures. The relevance of these categories
   for analysis is illustrated by discussing recent cases of business
   lobbying on the EU's geoeconomic agenda, as well as business responses
   to the sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.
   These illustrative examples show that whilst most business actors have
   adapted their strategies, there are also cases where business actors
   adhere to and defend the status quo. The article prepares the ground for
   further research on the understudied consequences of the geoeconomic
   turn for business power.},

Abstract = {This article suggests that the ongoing denial by the USA federal
   government of historical human rights infractions against African
   Americans and people of African descent led to a proliferation of local
   transitional justice efforts. Drawing from a university-driven
   transitional justice project, this article offers an analysis of local
   initiatives and highlights one of its six transitional justice
   collaborations. The university project sought to decolonize its
   structure and approach, drawing on methods of cultural humility,
   desire-based research and deep listening. This article responds to the
   success and challenges of decolonizing a transitional justice project
   within academia. Findings suggested that local initiatives face
   obstacles due to enduring legacies of harms and silenced histories,
   necessitating communities to substantiate their claims. Capacity issues
   and funding are challenged due to centuries of disinvestment. The
   article offers lessons learned for potential ally organizations who seek
   to advance transitional justice where government-sponsored redress
   continues to be denied.},

Abstract = {How does inclusion in social policy programs strengthen individuals'
   support for redistribution, and lead to spillovers in support for future
   social policy programs? We study a unique dataset of 1,300 Moscow
   residents to estimate the effect of participating in a
   government-sponsored redevelopment program on preferences for
   redistributive social policy. Our design exploits features of the
   program designed to foster institutional trust by engaging citizens in
   the policy design process. We report a positive effect: individuals in
   buildings slated for redevelopment are more likely to agree that the
   government should reduce income differences between rich and poor,
   provide for the unemployed, and provide public housing. Our findings
   suggest that increased trust in the government is a channel through
   which program participation affects redistribution preferences, show how
   programs can be used strategically to promote a redistributive agenda,
   and suggest a pathway for the co-persistence of redistribution
   preferences and redistributive state policies.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the external dimension of migration policy
   (EXMIPO) in the EU member states (MSs), through a policy tool approach.
   It offers an analytical framework for conceptualizing MS EXMIPO, by (1)
   unpacking its tools and (2) understanding their relationship with
   EU-level migration governance, as based on competition, convergence and
   complementarity. Empirically, it examines the case of Italy, building on
   an original dataset spanning over 30years and 125 instruments. Through
   the Italian case, this article demonstrates that MSs have developed an
   intense external action at the bilateral level in the field of
   migration, which has expanded quantitatively and qualitatively,
   alongside (and despite) EU initiatives.},

Abstract = {This article highlights some material aspects of informal governance by
   analysing the unsigned confidential documents intended to drive the
   future of the European automotive sector in 1991. Whilst it was long
   thought that the EEC-Japan agreement had been unwritten, this study
   reveals that it was a combination of oral and written statements,
   bilateral decisions and unilateral interpretations. These ambiguities
   have been used by the Commission to achieve the impossible: providing
   for one thing and its opposite in order to satisfy extremely divided
   opinions. Using public and private archives of several stakeholders, the
   article underlines the Commission's power over institutional (Member
   States and the European Parliament) and private (industry and NGOs)
   players. Whilst recent studies have pointed to repeated unwritten rules
   to temper informality leading to a democratic deficit, the 1991
   non-consensual consensus eluded any tacit rule because it lay in the
   grey area of diplomacy, economics and law.},

Abstract = {Organizational overlap is a ubiquitous feature in regional governance.
   Most studies have focused on member states, demonstrating that overlap
   enables states differently. We still know little about whether and how
   overlapping organizations impact international bureaucracies and how
   this shapes the relationship between bureaucratic actors within
   organizations. We argue that overlap can empower international
   bureaucrats, but not equally. Those with autonomous resources from
   member states are the most attractive interlocuters for bureaucrats from
   other organizations and, hence, likely to become most empowered.
   Substantive expertise and formal competence are less consequential in
   this context. We unpack this argument by looking at a policy domain
   understood to be heavily guarded by member states, security and defence
   policy. Based on primary documents and interviews, we show that the
   European Union (EU)-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) overlap
   has enabled the European Commission to leverage its position within the
   EU to its advantage and further encroach on the EU's security and
   defence activities.},

Abstract = {This article critically interrogates and evaluates the concept of
   political masculinities as part of enhancing dialogue between political
   science and critical studies on men and masculinities. It discusses what
   counts as masculinity, what counts as political and how they connect.
   The connections are all too clear in mainstream politics, not only in
   populist, authoritarian, ethnonationalist and militaristic politics but
   also in democratic, socialist and various activist politics. The
   evaluation of the concept of political masculinities is conducted by
   asking three main questions: how does the concept add to, complement or
   contradict existing and established external concepts and theories? How
   is the concept constructed internally, and with what structure, elements
   and interrelations? And how can the application of the concept be
   possibly extended into fields beyond those usually recognized and
   labelled explicitly as specifically political fields, including the
   politics of the everyday and the politics of multiple global crises?},

Abstract = {Territorial divisions are commonly believed to dominate the
   international realm, supposedly leaving no room for ideological
   distinctions to take shape. However, the formation of over fifty
   transnational political groups (TPGs) across thirteen international
   parliaments challenges this assumption, calling into question the
   previously accepted insignificance of ideology beyond the boundaries of
   the nation-state. Previously unexplored in comparative perspective, this
   paper investigates TPGs' puzzling existence and delineates the
   conditions for their emergence within international parliaments. The
   theoretical argument is that homogeneity across the member states of the
   international parliament along three dimensions - political systems,
   economic development levels and geographical proximity - fosters the
   creation of transnational political groups. Results from regression
   analysis on time series cross-sectional data lend support to the theory.
   With the rise of international parliamentary institutions and their
   increased involvement in supranational decision-making over time, it
   becomes highly important to understand how they organize as well as the
   implications of their institutional designs.},

Title = {Lessons from the Viral Body Politic: Borders and the Possibilities of a
   More-than-Human Worldmaking},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 3},
Abstract = {Bordering practices have been a central and controversial feature of the
   SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Closed borders, lockdowns, and restrictions on
   movement and individual ``freedoms{''} have revived concepts of the
   biopolitical ``state of exception{''} and state control. In this
   article, we argue that biopolitical critiques of responses to the
   pandemic fail to grasp the opportunity to rethink worldmaking and
   instead base their critiques on a desired ``return to normal{''} which
   foregrounds human-centric individualism at the expense of alternative
   worldmaking that accounts for the more-than-human. To do so, we bring
   the virus and the virome into our discussion to rethink bordering
   practices and how the SARS-CoV-2 virus affects bodies, worlds, and
   politics. We focus primarily on the Australian case, where the pandemic
   response began with lockdowns and then gave way to a militarized and
   individualistic approach. Responses to the pandemic have failed to
   produce a reimagining of human and more-than-human relations.
   Opportunities for ethical engagement have been missed, resulting in
   limited responses that stem from the failure of state capacity and
   entrenched modes of inequality that are harmful to vulnerable others,
   both human and more-than-human. This requires an ontological reframing
   of how we relate to a complex world from a more-than-human perspective.
   Les pratiques relatives aux frontieres constituaient une caracteristique
   decisive mais controversee de la pandemie de SARS-CoV-2. La fermeture
   des frontieres, les confinements et les restrictions des mouvements et
   des << libertes individuelles >> ont fait renaitre les concepts d'<<
   etat d'exception >> biopolitique et de controle de l'etat. Dans cet
   article, nous affirmons que les critiques biopolitiques des mesures
   liees a la pandemie ne saisissent pas l'opportunite de repenser la
   conception du monde, et fondent davantage leurs critiques sur le <<
   retour a la normale >> souhaite, qui met en avant l'individualisme
   anthropocentrique, plutot qu'une autre conception du monde qui prendrait
   en compte le plus qu'humain. Pour ce faire, nous introduisons le virus
   et le virome dans notre discussion pour repenser les pratiques relatives
   aux frontieres et les effets du virus SARS-CoV-2 sur les corps, les
   mondes et la politique. Nous nous concentrons principalement sur le cas
   australien, ou la reponse a la pandemie a debute par des confinements,
   puis a laisse place a une approche militarisee et individualiste. Les
   mesures prises pendant la pandemie n'ont pas reimagine les relations
   humaines et plus qu'humaines. Nous avons manque les opportunites
   d'engagement ethique, ce qui a limite nos reponses a cause de
   l'incapacite des etats et des modes d'inegalites tenaces, nocifs pour
   les autres vulnerables, tant humains que plus qu'humains. Aussi est-il
   necessaire de resituer sur le plan ontologique notre relation a un monde
   complexe d'apres une perspective plus qu'humaines.
   Las practicas fronterizas han sido una caracteristica importante y
   controvertida de la pandemia de SARS-CoV-2. Los cierres de fronteras,
   los confinamientos y las restricciones a la circulacion y a las <<
   libertades >> individuales han revivido los conceptos del << estado de
   excepcion >> biopolitico y el control estatal. En este articulo
   argumentamos que las criticas biopoliticas a las respuestas contra la
   pandemia no aprovechan la oportunidad de repensar la construccion del
   mundo y, en cambio, basan sus criticas en un deseado << retorno a la
   normalidad >> que pone en primer plano el individualismo centrado en el
   ser humano a expensas de la creacion de mundos alternativos que tienen
   en cuenta mas de lo que es el ser humano. Para ello, utilizamos tanto el
   virus como el viroma en nuestra discusion con el fin de repensar las
   practicas fronterizas y como el virus SARS-CoV-2 afecta a los
   organismos, a los mundos y a la politica. Nos centramos principalmente
   en el caso australiano, donde la respuesta a la pandemia comenzo con
   confinamientos y, a continuacion, dio paso a un enfoque militarizado e
   individualista. Las respuestas a la pandemia no han logrado producir una
   reinvencion de las relaciones humanas y mas que humanas. En
   consecuencia, se han perdido oportunidades para lograr un compromiso
   etico, lo que ha dado lugar a respuestas limitadas que se derivan del
   fracaso de la capacidad del Estado y de modos arraigados de desigualdad
   que son perjudiciales para otros seres vulnerables, tanto humanos como
   mas que humanos. Esto requiere un replanteamiento ontologico de como nos
   relacionamos con un mundo complejo desde una perspectiva mas que humana.},

Abstract = {Theories of international recognition posit that states' identities are
   formed through dialogical relations with other states. However, they
   often overlook the ways in which weaker states' struggles, constrained
   within the languages of the powerful, produce misrecognition and inhibit
   identity formation. This is the experience of many post-colonial
   francophone African states whose search for international recognition
   has been inhibited by their special relationship with France, their
   former coloniser. This article shows how such struggles for recognition
   can fail. It draws on two examples of francophone African countries,
   showing how their search for recognition sprung from the misrecognition
   of colonial experiences. Each has made explicit attempts to attract
   richer forms of state recognition through purposive acts but has
   continued to do so within post-colonial conditions. Using citizens'
   understandings of these struggles, the article explores what drove them,
   how they manifested and how they unravelled. It draws on Frantz Fanon's
   account of misrecognition, making a novel interpretation based on his
   concept of `speaking proper French', or how experiences of `identity
   alienation' can only produce further misrecognition.},

Abstract = {When the US Supreme Court's conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade
   (1973) in late June 2022, it created legal, political, and practical
   chaos in the US, as abortion - previously a fundamental right under the
   US Constitution - was now under state jurisdiction. In this special
   issue, we cover a range of theoretical and practical implications of the
   Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision and the
   stratification of reproductive freedoms across the US. We ask the
   important questions of: how did we get here, who bears the burdens of
   the Dobbs decision, and what complications will likely occur in the
   future because of this decision? Our contributors come from
   interdisciplinary fields which illustrate the wide ranging the
   implications of this opinion. We show how these pieces add significantly
   to the growing scholarly conversations focused on the political, legal,
   and social significance of the fall of Roe v. Wade.},

Abstract = {Since the introduction of the euro, German growth has been primarily
   based on exports. Signs of an exhaustion of Germany's export-led growth
   model were already evident before the energy crisis of 2022-23, which
   hit the country hard. German elites could have capitalized on the shock
   to rebalance their growth strategy. But the opposite happened: the
   government's adjustment strategy has aimed at doubling down on
   export-led growth and protecting the core export industries. This
   article investigates the politics of Germany's economic policymaking in
   hard times. We show that the government's economic policy responses were
   driven largely by an export sector growth coalition led by cross-class
   alliances in the chemical, metalworking, and engineering sectors. In
   contrast to previous corporatist decision-making, which aimed to include
   broader societal concerns in peak-level concertation, German corporatism
   has undergone a functional transformation toward the predominance of
   export sector distributive coalitions. This article's findings
   contribute to the emerging literature on the politics of growth models
   in comparative political economy.},

Abstract = {What drives ordinary citizens to want their country to join or stay in
   the European Union (EU)? Whilst scholarship addressed value-based
   dispositions as drivers of pro-EU positions, material benefits dominate
   explanations of support for EU accession and membership. New research
   suggests that it is precisely the growing import of being an adherent of
   liberal democratic values that drove citizens in countries as disparate
   as Ukraine, Poland and Belarus to support EU accession and remained the
   key driver for those already in the Union wanting to stay in. Employing
   national surveys and regression analyses, this article shows that (a)
   not only is a shift to supporting EU accession accompanied by citizens
   also moving towards supporting democracy in Ukraine; (b) this EU
   democratic pull phenomenon can also be identified amongst citizens of
   other EU neighbourhood countries, as well as in EU member states.},

Abstract = {Do locals discriminate against themselves by favoring foreigners with
   higher expected purchasing power? Drawing on theories of prejudice,
   discrimination, and colonialism, I argue that in colonized and
   post-colonial countries, local home sellers discriminate against local
   potential homebuyers while favoring foreigners with expected higher
   purchasing power, anticipating a more profitable transaction. I support
   this argument with evidence from a preregistered online audit study
   targeting discriminatory attitudes toward local home buyers. In the
   study, fictitious home buyers with distinctive language and ethnic names
   emailed 1,512 home sellers (realtors and homeowners) across all
   municipalities in Puerto Rico. Home sellers reported more houses
   available to Americans and invited them to more house showings than
   Puerto Ricans. My estimates indicate that ethnic discrimination exists
   in the Puerto Rican housing market. These findings provide new insights
   into ethnic dynamics in colonized and post-colonial societies and
   underscore concerns about recent legislation that turned Puerto Rico
   into a tax haven.},

Abstract = {This article traces how the ` freedom indispensable for scientific
   research' was introduced into the International Covenant on Economic,
   Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). The review of the drafting history
   covers ICESCR Article 15.3 and that of its precursor, Article 27 in the
   Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). It pays particular
   attention to arguments presented during negotiations over the UDHR
   (adopted in 1948), as well as over the ICESCR (adopted in 1966), and it
   reflects on observable norm entrepreneurship. Following the end of the
   Cold War, details on the right to science and the status of higher
   education personnel were further elaborated in soft law, notably in the
   form of two General Comments and two UNESCO Recommendations. These
   specifications and the earlier traveaux pr \& eacute;paratoires reveal a
   multifaceted and rich debate about science, development, dignity and
   freedom at the United Nations, including positions that span variations
   of a liberal science script as well as persistent illiberal
   contestations.},

Abstract = {The decline in democratic quality and the increasing electoral
   popularity of illiberal populist parties are among the most notable
   global phenomena in the past 20 years. This article builds a bridge
   between the growing body of political science literature addressing how
   democratic backsliding impacts linkages between governments and
   organized interests and the public administration literature exploring
   how illiberal populists reshape the bureaucracy. Focusing on regulatory
   agencies in four post-communist countries that have recently experienced
   varying degrees of democrating backsliding, we explore whether and how
   interactions between bureaucrats and interest groups have changed amid
   democratic decline. We find that even in the context of backsliding,
   professionalization (i.e. internal organizational development) and
   expertise provision are strong positive predictors of interest groups'
   access to regulators. However, our analysis unequivocally shows that
   exclusion by illiberal populist incumbent parties has a profound and
   negative effect on organizations' ability to reach bureaucracies. We
   draw on a new survey dataset, which grasps relationships between
   organized interests and political institutions (i.e. governments,
   parties, regulatory agencies, parliaments) in the region.},

Abstract = {Scholarship on the administration of international organizations (IOs)
   has extensively discussed how autonomy influences their performance.
   While some argue that autonomy increases performance through greater
   adaptability, others warn that it may increase the risk of agency slack.
   Authors typically distinguish between three types of performance:
   output, outcome, and impact performance. We focus on core funding as a
   key source of IO autonomy and argue that projects with more core funding
   show decreased output performance but an increased outcome and impact
   performance. Our empirical analysis relies on results from data on up to
   3590 development projects run by the United Nations Development Program
   (UNDP) in 128 recipient countries between 2004 and 2020. Subsequently,
   we test the impact of more core funding on project volumes (output
   performance), objectives achieved in individual projects (outcome
   performance), and their effects on sub-national human development in
   project regions (impact performance). Our findings suggest that,
   although reliance on core resources is associated with lower output
   performance (less funding), it may result in stronger outcome and impact
   performance, as reflected by more objectives achieved and a higher
   sub-national HDI where UNDP projects are implemented. Our findings have
   important implications for debates on the effectiveness of global
   governance.},

Title = {Out of Sight, Out of Mind? UK-EU Member States Bilateralism as an
   Enabler of Europeanisation},
Journal = {JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 29},
Abstract = {Whilst an extensive scholarship has questioned the role of the United
   Kingdom in multilateral and mini-lateral venues, less attention has been
   devoted to the signature of 24 bilateral declarations between the United
   Kingdom and EU member states from 2021 to 2023. Bilateralism has indeed
   been one of the preferred UK strategies to achieve foreign policy
   co-ordination with EU member states post-Brexit. Questioning the
   intentionality of the United Kingdom in initiating and investing these
   arrangements, we find that despite the clear attempts to deEUise its
   foreign policy, we are also not witnessing purposes of
   de-Europeanisation that would imply a repudiation of European shared
   values, a divergence from common priorities and an end to social
   encounters between UK and EU member states' officials. Instead, through
   a frame analysis of these declarations and interviews, we highlight that
   bilateralism has enabled continued Europeanisation, even though to a
   lesser extent in comparison with the pre-Brexit situation. Closer
   relations with European capitals are thus enabling Europeanisation of UK
   foreign policy to persist. In other words, we conclude that whilst there
   has been, on the side of the United Kingdom, a repudiation of the EU as
   a political entity, there has been no rejection of common European
   values and priorities, which remain shared with EU member states.},

Abstract = {Based on the Latin American structuralist theory, but advocating for a
   need of framing the discussions in the current historical context -
   characterised by financialisation and financial globalisation -, this
   article investigates the centre-periphery configuration of the global
   economy with the focus on the monetary-financial sphere. More
   specifically, it aims to analyse the role of the peripheral countries
   for the current International Monetary and Financial System (IMFS). In a
   dialogue with the discussions related to the International Division of
   Labour (IDL), the article thence proposes and conceptualises the
   International Division of Finance (IDF), as well as its corresponding
   structural differentiation and structural tendency. It argues that the
   IDF is not accidental, but plays a fundamental role in the modus
   operandi of the reproduction of wealth in international financial
   circuits. Through an empirical analysis with data from 212 countries for
   the period 2000-23, the article demonstrates a structural tendency of
   transfer of wealth from periphery to central countries. Along with the
   IDL (in its contemporary format), it generates a `double-capture of
   wealth'. As a result, the IDL and the IDF have feedback effects,
   deepening the subordination, the lack of autonomy for economic policy
   and the vulnerability of peripheral countries.},

Abstract = {While foreign policy is a reserved matter for the British government in
   Westminster, it is clear that the Scottish government aspires to, and
   indeed has implemented, an expanding programme of independent external
   relations. It is not the first sub-state political actor to do so.
   Whether as a part of the UK, or as potentially an independent country,
   Scotland has put considerable effort into developing an identity as a
   good global citizen. One area in particular where this has occurred is
   in human rights, where it has demonstrated leadership on a number of
   issues and sought to connect its domestic commitments to human rights to
   its external persona. This article will examine the dynamics of this
   development, looking at both the constraints and the possibilities for
   Scotland as an international human rights actor.},

Title = {Two Norms Collide: EU Policy on Fragile and Conflict-Affected Countries},
Journal = {JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 11},
Abstract = {The European Union's (EU's) policy towards fragile and conflict-affected
   (FCA) countries has been framed by a normative solidarity narrative that
   promotes and legitimises collective action. Over the past two decades,
   the EU's commitment to protecting the security of its citizens has
   increasingly become a strong, competing normative driver of EU
   engagement in FCA countries. In tracing its evolution, this symposium
   article shows how the collision of the `solidarity' and `protection'
   norms has shaped the EU's approach towards state fragility. We
   illustrate this by discussing the policy frameworks for the EU's
   engagements in Mali and Libya. We argue that whilst the increasing
   relative strength of the protection norm has not united EU Member States
   around a common set of objectives, the solidarity norm has proven to be
   resilient at the discursive level. However, the increasing prevalence of
   the protection norm has weakened the solidarity norm's influence on
   policy practice. This has had systemic effects and contributed to
   incoherencies in the EU's foreign policy approach.},

Abstract = {This essay argues that Russia's war on Ukraine and the post-Soviet
   experience, more generally, reveal ethical, empirical, and theoretical
   problems in the study of nationalism in the region; namely, the tendency
   to designate anti-colonial, non-Russian nationalism as a ``bad{''}
   ethnic type and the related tendency to see opposition to it as a
   ``good{''} civic, nationalist agenda while in reality, the latter agenda
   can be imperial. Conflation of imperialism with civic nationalism and
   underappreciation of the democratic potential of non-Russian nationalism
   are problematic. The essay argues that these problems stem from
   theorizing about ethnic and civic nationalism that is rooted in abstract
   principles and does not take into account the empirical realities in
   which specific policies originate. I suggest that a more ethically and
   theoretically accurate characterization of types of nationalism as good
   or bad can be achieved by applying a methodology that takes into account
   not only formal markers of ``ethnic{''} and ``civic{''} policies but
   also the realities proponents and opponents of a given policy seek to
   establish and undo, the methods by which these realities come into
   being, and the constraints on employing illiberal methods that political
   actors face.},

Abstract = {While states have accelerated the energy transition in some sectors,
   they have also obstructed fossil phase-out in other sectors. Aviation
   has an outsized and rapidly growing climate impact, and associated
   policy decisions have perpetuated fossil fuel use. Since aviation is
   dependent on high energy density that only fossil fuels can (currently)
   provide, the industry faces fundamental constraints to green its
   capital. Yet, the industry does not operate in isolation. In this paper,
   we show how the state performs a variety of roles that benefit from and
   support aviation, creating conflicts with the state's climate targets.
   We analyze state-industry relations as they relate to the emergence of
   air transport and its ongoing carbon-dependent formulations. Combining a
   relational account of the state and the method of critical
   problem-solving, we characterize the roles of the state vis-\&
   agrave;-vis the industry as owner, sponsor and customer and point to
   strategies of how the associated capacities can be leveraged to drive
   fossil phase-out in aviation. Since a rapid and comprehensive phase-out
   of fossil fuels is required for climate stabilization, we argue that
   political economists can make important contributions by focusing on the
   socio-material relations that constrain state agency to phase-out fossil
   fuels in specific sectors.},

Abstract = {The various and diverse academic responses to the Conference on the
   Future of Europe's efforts at democratic renewal, including those by Ben
   Crum, Markus Patberg and Sandra Seubert, speak not only to the lack of a
   clear institutional locus or pathway associated with the Conference, but
   also to differing understandings of the basic conditions of existence -
   or political ontology - of the European Union. These differing
   understandings are reflected in different attitudes to the European
   Union's constitutional standing and prospects. This article explores how
   the special place of constitutional retrofitting in the European Union -
   of reconstructing and reimagining an originally pre-constitutional
   system in constitutional terms - helps to illuminate the different
   understanding of political ontology in play, and helps clarify what is
   at stake in the continuing debate over fundamental reform.},

Abstract = {After allegations of the US intelligence community conducting illegal
   operations that targeted American citizens, 1975 became known as the
   Year of Intelligence. The subject dominated national discourse and led
   to competing programmes of intelligence oversight proposed by Congress
   and the executive branch. This article examines the Ford
   administration's programme that started with the Rockefeller Commission
   in January 1975 and ended with the issue of Executive order 11,905 in
   1976. It argues that neither were enough to stave off Congress intruding
   on executive control of the intelligence community, because the Ford
   administration inaccurately measured the public's demands for genuine
   reform.},

Abstract = {Interfirm self-regulation through trade associations is common but its
   effectiveness is debated and likely varies by time, country, and
   industry. This study examines self-regulation of pharmaceutical
   marketing, characterized by delegation of major regulatory
   responsibilities to trade associations' self-regulatory bodies. In
   addressing critical research gaps, this study first analyzes 1,776
   complaints against pharmaceutical companies in the UK over 18 years
   (2004-2021). Findings regarding severe, repeat, and complex offending,
   and delays in complaint resolution raise significant concerns about the
   adequacy of UK's self-regulation in deterring wrongdoing. Second, the
   study conducts international comparisons using recent complaints data
   from 30 European pharmaceutical industry self-regulatory bodies. Despite
   shortcomings of UK's self-regulation, it appears more adept at
   identifying potential breaches compared to most other countries,
   suggesting significant underdetection or underreporting of drug company
   misconduct in Europe. On balance, our findings are concerning given the
   negative effects of poorly regulated pharmaceutical marketing on medical
   practice and health.},

Abstract = {The Colombian Truth Commission (2018 to 2022) provides a unique
   opportunity to delve into the participation of ex-military personnel and
   former guerrillas within truth-seeking bodies. While existing literature
   highlights the importance of their involvement in facilitating the
   assumption of responsibilities, rebuilding relations with their victims
   and undergoing personal transformation, it tends to overlook their
   potential contribution to truth and memory. After conducting interviews
   with former Commissioners, staff, soldiers and ex-guerrillas over a
   two-year period, our research reveals that former fighters maintained
   confrontational attitudes toward their previous adversaries. They
   primarily focused on promoting historical memory narratives rather than
   making substantial contributions to uncovering the truth. Conversely,
   the Commission took a moral stance in supporting the victims but failed
   to prevent conflicting narratives from hindering the path to
   reconciliation. The Colombian experience underscores the need for
   strategies to ensure that truth-seeking and memory spaces play a
   constructive role postconflict, and to accommodate perpetrators'
   contributions to historical clarification without condoning their
   actions.},

Abstract = {This article explores the intricate relationship between the Israeli
   state and Jewish settlers in the occupied Palestinian West Bank after
   the Oslo Accords (1993). It shows that, despite the accords, which
   prohibited the establishment of new settlements, such activities
   persisted. Instead, the accords triggered the seemingly spontaneous
   emergence of numerous illegal ``hilltop settlements,{''} tolerated by
   higher echelons of government and actively supported by lower levels.
   These settlements subsequently underwent a gradual post hoc
   formalization process, ultimately leading to their full legalization.
   The article elucidates how a faction within Israeli society influenced
   segments of the government, employing blame games as a strategy to
   rationalize the legitimization of the Israeli land grab. Notably, it
   highlights the strategic and deceptive tactics employed by various
   Israeli governments in their dealings with the settler movement. The
   article concludes by reflecting on the political implications of the
   settler movement's success for the democratic character of the Israeli
   state.},

Abstract = {This article considers the role of central bank interventions in credit
   and financial markets in support of decarbonization. Drawing on the
   critical macrofinance literature, we argue that central banks are
   constrained in greening financial flows by their continued adherence to
   monetary dominance - prioritizing short-term price stability - and the
   structural demands of global market-based finance. This has led to a
   narrow focus on `market-fixing' and `de-risking' policy interventions,
   implicitly outsourcing the green transition to private finance whilst
   asserting that central banks cannot be seen as `climate policymakers'.
   Moving beyond the constraints of this macrofinancial regime remains
   challenging, as we illustrate with the European Central Bank's (ECB)
   tilting of its corporate asset purchase program. We explore the lessons
   from the Post-World War II credit guidance regimes employed in many
   countries and consider how these could be updated to meet the challenges
   posed by market-based finance. Such a shift would require an evolution
   in the role of the central bank as a public agency, challenging current
   norms around independence and market neutrality.},

Abstract = {Decades of mobilization preceded the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe
   v. Wade. Yet while the outcome of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
   Organization was highly predictable, the decision nonetheless came as a
   shock to the political and legal systems-and, based on the justices'
   first encounters with the post-Dobbs world during the 2023-2024 term, it
   was perhaps even a shock to the court itself. Women played little more
   than a walk-on role both in the recognition of a constitutional right to
   abortion (a decision essentially about doctors) and in the repudiation
   of that right (a decision essentially about fetuses). But now, in the
   half of the country where even medically necessary abortion is
   unavailable after Dobbs, concerns for pregnant women and their fate
   dominate, and the justices appear no longer so certain that they are
   finished with abortion. Their work, in fact, may be just beginning.},

Abstract = {This article investigates whether populism affects the foreign policy of
   European Union (EU) member states towards China and, if so, through what
   mechanisms. In order to answer this question, we examine the cases of
   Italy and Czechia, both of which went through turbulent relations with
   China in the recent decade whilst also experiencing several government
   changes between populist and non-populist parties. Our analysis reveals
   that whilst populist-led governments appeared to be more China-friendly
   than non-populist governments, the impact of populism is not direct but
   mediated through other variables, namely, thick ideology, economic
   pragmatism and international positioning. We propose this model as a
   hypothesis for testing in future research. In addition, our findings
   suggest a need to rethink the relationship between thin-thick ideologies
   in the study of populism and to emphasise the role of `economic
   pragmatism' as a mediating variable, which has been largely missing from
   the literature on populist foreign policy.},

Abstract = {This article explores the European Union's (EU's) assistance to Ukraine
   through the lens of critical geopolitics with a view to ascertaining
   whether the EU has become more geopolitical in its thinking and actions
   towards Eastern Europe. Our findings point to a mixed picture. Whilst
   the EU `mindscape' appears to have shifted in relation to Eastern
   Europe, Ukraine and itself as an actor in the region, it is less
   apparent that the EU's foreign and security policy action has become
   geopoliticised. The 2022 Russian invasion has certainly seen a step
   change from the hesitant and self-conscious approach that characterised
   the EU's engagement with Eastern Europe prior to 2022. However,
   declarations such as that by the High Representative and Vice President
   of the European Commission (HRVP) around the `birth of geopolitical
   Europe' appear to be somewhat premature, as there is limited evidence at
   this stage that the EU is willing to provide leadership on the
   geospatial (re)ordering of the region.},

Title = {Individual agency in South-South policy transfer: China and Ethiopia's
   industrial park development},

Pages = {1544-1568},

Abstract = {This article process-traces Ethiopia's adoption and implementation of
   the industrial park development strategy from the mid 2000s to the late
   2010s. How does policy transfer unfold, and what characterizes China's
   influence on Ethiopia's Special Economic Zone (SEZ) strategy? Drawing on
   extensive interviews conducted during multiple field trips to Ethiopia
   and China between 2017 and 2023, complemented by secondary sources, we
   argue that policy transfer involves navigating both structural
   opportunities-providing incentives and resources for individuals-and
   individual agency to surmount structural constraints. Contributing to
   the growing body of literature on South-South policy transfer, our study
   underscores the pivotal role of individual agency in overcoming
   prevalent structural constraints within South-South contexts,
   characterized by fluid power relations and less defined policy transfer
   networks. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of scrutinizing the
   agency of host-country actors in their engagements with a rising China,
   rather than assuming China's impacts in a deterministic manner. Our
   detailed documentation offers a nuanced perspective on China's influence
   in Ethiopia's industrialization. We show that primary agency in the
   policy transfer process should be attributed to Ethiopian actors,
   whereas the roles of Chinese actors range from initiation, facilitation,
   and occasionally, reluctant responses in this intricate process.},

Abstract = {Regulators are increasingly concerned about deceptive, online choice
   architecture, including dark patterns and behavioral sludge. From a
   behavioral science perspective, fostering a regulatory environment which
   reduces the economic harm caused by deceptive designs, while
   safeguarding the benefits of well-meaning behavioral insights, is
   essential. This article argues for a principles-based approach and
   proposes behavioral audits as a tool to support this approach.},

Title = {How Best to Be Egyptian? The ``Honorable Citizen{''} and the Making of
   the Counter-revolutionary Subject},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Despite growing interest in studying counter-revolution in Egypt,
   scholars have neglected the ways in which the regulation of normativity
   governs conduct and discourages resistance. This article argues that
   discourses of normativity in Egypt have produced counter-revolutionary
   subjectivities, without whom the counter-revolution could not have
   succeeded. These subjectivities are constructed through the mobilization
   of normal/deviant binary logics, which are encapsulated in the normative
   figure of the honorable citizen. I suggest that the honorable
   citizen-which informs how best to be Egyptian-is a contradictory figure
   that is made possible by the ongoing interaction between (post)colonial
   and neoliberal governing rationalities. By employing Foucault's work on
   governmentality, and Cynthia Weber's queer analysis of figuration, I
   conceptualize normal/deviant logics through what I call
   counter-revolutionary governmentality (CRG). CRG reduces the originality
   of Egyptian resistance by associating it with the desire to be
   Westernized and constructs revolutionary aspirations as a threat to
   sovereignty. I argue that figurations of normative ``Egyptianness{''}
   fortify Egypt's ``backwardness{''} in contemporary international
   orderings of progressive versus backward states and maintain
   international hierarchies that privilege Western modes of socio-economic
   and political organization. Such maintenance is not only the work of the
   global North but is also reproduced in the South.
   Malgr \& eacute; un int \& eacute;r \& ecirc;t croissant pour l'\&
   eacute;tude de la contre-r \& eacute;volution en \& Eacute;gypte, les
   chercheurs ont n \& eacute;glig \& eacute; les fa \& ccedil;ons dont la
   r \& eacute;glementation de la normativit \& eacute; r \& eacute;git le
   comportement et d \& eacute;courage la r \& eacute;sistance. Cet article
   affirme que les discours de normativit \& eacute; en \& Eacute;gypte ont
   produit des subjectivit \& eacute;s contre-r \& eacute;volutionnaires,
   sans lesquelles la contre-r \& eacute;volution n'aurait pu r \&
   eacute;ussir. Ces subjectivit \& eacute;s s'\& eacute;tablissent en
   mobilisant des logiques binaires Normal/D \& eacute;viant, r \&
   eacute;sum \& eacute;es dans le portrait normatif du citoyen honorable.
   Je propose que le portrait du citoyen honorable-le meilleur \&
   Eacute;gyptien que l'on puisse \& ecirc;tre-s'av \& egrave;re
   contradictoire et qu'il n'aurait pu voir le jour sans les interactions
   continues entre les rationalit \& eacute;s (post)coloniales et n \&
   eacute;olib \& eacute;rales de gouvernance. En employant le travail de
   Michel Foucault sur la gouvernementalit \& eacute; et l'analyse de la
   figuration de Cynthia Weber, je conceptualize les logiques Normal/D \&
   eacute;viant par le biais de ce que j'appelle la gouvernementalit \&
   eacute; contre-r \& eacute;volutionnaire (GCR). La GCR r \& eacute;duit
   l'originalit \& eacute; de la r \& eacute;sistance \& eacute;gyptienne
   en l'associant au d \& eacute;sir d'occidentalisation et envisage les
   aspirations r \& eacute;volutionnaires telle une menace pour la
   souverainet \& eacute;. J'affirme que les figurations du << caract \&
   egrave;re \& eacute;gyptien >> normatif renforcent le retard de l'\&
   Eacute;gypte dans les ordres internationaux contemporains d'\&
   Eacute;tats progressistes et d'\& Eacute;tats arri \& eacute;r \&
   eacute;s, tout en entretenant des hi \& eacute;rarchies internationales
   qui favorisent les modes occidentaux d'organisation socio \&
   eacute;conomique et politique. Ce sch \& eacute;ma ne revient pas qu'aux
   pays du Nord ; le Sud le reproduit aussi.
   A pesar del creciente inter \& eacute;s por estudiar la contrarrevoluci
   \& oacute;n en Egipto, los acad \& eacute;micos han descuidado las
   formas en que la regulaci \& oacute;n de la normatividad gobierna la
   conducta y desalienta la resistencia. Este art \& iacute;culo argumenta
   que los discursos de normatividad que han tenido lugar en Egipto han
   producido subjetividades de car \& aacute;cter contrarrevolucionario,
   sin las cuales la contrarrevoluci \& oacute;n no podr \& iacute;a haber
   triunfado. Estas subjetividades se construyen a trav \& eacute;s de la
   movilizaci \& oacute;n de l \& oacute;gicas binarias normal/desviaci \&
   oacute;n, las cuales se engloban dentro de la figura normativa del
   ciudadano honorable. Sugerimos que la figura del ciudadano honorable, la
   cual informa sobre la mejor manera de ser egipcio, es una figura de car
   \& aacute;cter contradictorio, cuya existencia es posible gracias a la
   interacci \& oacute;n en curso entre las racionalidades en materia de
   gobierno, tanto (pos)coloniales como neoliberales. Utilizamos el trabajo
   de Foucault sobre la gubernamentalidad, y el an \& aacute;lisis << queer
   >> de la figuraci \& oacute;n de Cynthia Weber, para conceptualizar las
   l \& oacute;gicas normales y las l \& oacute;gicas desviadas a trav \&
   eacute;s de lo que llamamos gubernamentalidad contrarrevolucionaria
   (CRG, por sus siglas en ingl \& eacute;s). La CRG reduce la originalidad
   de la resistencia egipcia, asoci \& aacute;ndola con el deseo de ser
   occidentalizada, y construye las aspiraciones revolucionarias como una
   amenaza a la soberan \& iacute;a. Argumentamos que las figuraciones en
   materia de la ``egipciedad{''} normativa fortalecen el ``retraso{''} de
   Egipto dentro de los ordenamientos internacionales contempor \&
   aacute;neos de Estados progresistas frente a Estados retrasados y
   mantienen jerarqu \& iacute;as internacionales que privilegian los modos
   occidentales de organizaci \& oacute;n socioecon \& oacute;mica y pol \&
   iacute;tica. Este mantenimiento de las jerarqu \& iacute;as no es s \&
   oacute;lo obra del Norte global, sino que tambi \& eacute;n se reproduce
   en el Sur.},

Title = {Madonna versus ``Mother Russia?{''} Visual Anthropology of Loneliness
   and Gendered Nationalism on Russian 2021-2023 Political Posters},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {This article is aimed at transdisciplinary (critical International
   Relations, visual anthropology, and existential philosophy) analysis of
   Russian gendered nationalism and masculine ontological insecurities. It
   explores and re-imagines how visual representations of ``Mother
   Russia{''} became signifiers of the phallocentric voice of the Russian
   gendered state. What can return the voice back to the ``invisible
   women{''}? I claim that the political activism of the singer Madonna in
   the spheres of resistance to warfare and protection of gender minorities
   may shed new light on hidden manipulations with masculine anxieties in
   modern Russia. Besides original empirics, the article proposes
   theoretical avenues to integrate into gendered nationalism studies
   research on what I call masculine ``politics of loneliness.{''} I also
   look at the role such politics plays in constituting Russia's domestic
   narcissistic master narratives of the collective self and its frontiers
   with transnational celebrity activism. Based on feminism and narrative
   IR, this article investigates the ``sociological dimension{''} of
   Russian loneliness. It examines the alienation of femininity as
   reflected on Russian street posters photographed during 2021-2023 and
   represented in the form of five ``dialectical collages.{''}
   Cet article vise a analyser de maniere transdisciplinaire (IR critique,
   anthropologie visuelle, philosophie existentielle) le nationalisme genre
   russe et les insecurites ontologiques masculines. Il explore et
   reimagine comment les representations visuelles de la << Mere-Russie >>
   sont devenues des signifiants de la voix phallocentrique de l{''}etat
   genre russe. Qu{''}est-ce qui peut rendre la parole aux << femmes
   invisibles >>? Je pretends que l{''}activisme politique de la chanteuse
   Madonna dans les spheres de la resistance a la guerre et la protection
   de la diversite sexuelle peut jeter un nouvel eclairage sur les
   manipulations cachees des angoisses masculines dans la Russie moderne.
   Outre des donnees empiriques originales, l{''}article propose des pistes
   theoriques pour integrer dans les etudes sur le nationalisme genre des
   recherches sur ce que j{''}appelle << la politique de la solitude >>. Je
   me penche egalement sur le role que joue cette politique dans la
   constitution des recits narcissiques nationaux russes du moi collectif
   et de ses frontieres avec l{''}activisme transnational des celebrites.
   S{''}appuyant sur le feminisme et relations internationales narratives,
   cet article etudie la << dimension sociologique >> de la solitude russe.
   Il examine l{''}alienation de la feminite telle qu'elle se reflete dans
   les affiches de rue russes photographiees entre 2021 et 2023 et
   representees sous la forme de cinq << collages dialectiques >>.
   Este articulo tiene como objetivo el analisis transdisciplinar (RI
   critica, antropologia visual, filosofia existencial) del nacionalismo de
   genero ruso y las inseguridades ontologicas masculinas. Explora y
   reimagina como las representaciones visuales de la ``Madre Rusia{''} se
   convirtieron en significantes de la voz falocentrica del Estado de
   genero ruso. Que puede devolver la voz a las ``mujeres invisibles{''}?
   Afirmo que el activismo politico de la cantante Madonna en las esferas
   de la resistencia a la guerra y la proteccion de las minorias de genero
   puede arrojar nueva luz sobre las manipulaciones ocultas con ansiedades
   masculinas en la Rusia moderna. Ademas de empiricas originales, el
   articulo propone vias teoricas para integrar en los estudios sobre el
   nacionalismo de genero la investigacion sobre lo que yo llamo ``politica
   de la soledad.{''} Tambien examino el papel que desempena dicha politica
   en la constitucion de las narrativas narcisistas domesticas rusas del yo
   colectivo y sus fronteras con el activismo transnacional de las
   celebridades. Basandose en el feminismo y el narrativa IR, este articulo
   investiga la ``dimension sociologica{''} de la soledad rusa. Examina la
   alienacion de la feminidad tal y como se refleja en los carteles
   callejeros rusos fotografiados durante 2021-2023 y representados en
   forma de cinco ``collages dialecticos.{''}},

Abstract = {In this article, I consider critical writings on territory in
   International Relations, focusing on recent work on U.S. practices of
   extraterritorial jurisdiction. I suggest that, while such work has
   importantly traced the multiple ways in which U.S. authority often
   exceeds the supposed territorial boundaries of the United States, it has
   nonetheless failed to reckon with the contested and uneven nature of
   U.S. authority within such supposed boundaries. In particular, IR
   scholarship has failed to engage with the ways in which U.S. authority
   has been, and continued to be, contested by Indigenous people and
   nations. This failure is the product of an assumption that lies at the
   heart of the discipline-the assumption that Indigenous people are
   internal to colonizing or settler states. I suggest that the
   internalization of Indigenous people and Indigenous political
   organization that is at play in much IR scholarship is not simply a
   product of a generalized ``state-centrism{''} or a product of histories
   of settler colonialism, writ large. Rather, at the heart of the
   territorial assignations and allotments of IR scholarship are
   assumptions about legal authority or jurisdiction-about who has
   jurisdiction to define and assign land, about who does not, and what law
   means at all. Critiquing these assumptions and their political
   implications, I show the importance of asking: ``by what
   jurisdiction{''}? That is, what is the legal authority that we
   implicitly accept and assert when we designate territory in particular
   ways? The question insists that there are multiple laws (including
   multiple international laws) at play in global politics and opens up
   space for critical and postcolonial IR scholars to better take
   responsibility for their (often implicit) choices between multiple laws.
   Cet article s'int \& eacute;resse aux \& eacute;crits critiques relatifs
   au territoire en RI, en se concentrant sur des travaux r \& eacute;cents
   concernant la juridiction extraterritoriale des \& Eacute;tats-Unis. Ces
   \& eacute;crits importants ont retrac \& eacute; les fa \& ccedil;ons
   dont l'autorit \& eacute; am \& eacute;ricaine d \& eacute;passe souvent
   les limites territoriales suppos \& eacute;es des \& Eacute;tats-Unis,
   mais n'ont pas tenu compte de la nature contest \& eacute;e et in \&
   eacute;gale de l'autorit \& eacute; am \& eacute;ricaine au sein de ces
   fronti \& egrave;res. Plus particuli \& egrave;rement, la recherche en
   RI ne s'est pas encore int \& eacute;ress \& eacute;e aux mani \&
   egrave;res dont l'autorit \& eacute; am \& eacute;ricaine a \& eacute;t
   \& eacute;, et est toujours, contest \& eacute;e par les peuples et
   nations autochtones. Cette lacune d \& eacute;coule de l'hypoth \&
   egrave;se centrale de la discipline selon laquelle les peuples indig \&
   egrave;nes renvoient \& agrave; la colonisation et aux \& Eacute;tats
   colonisateurs. Selon moi, au c oe ur des attributions et r \&
   eacute;partitions territoriales de la recherche en RI se trouvent des
   hypoth \& egrave;ses quant \& agrave; l'autorit \& eacute; l \&
   eacute;gale ou la juridiction, quant au pouvoir ou non de d \&
   eacute;finir et d'attribuer des terres. Je remets en question ces hypoth
   \& egrave;ses et montre l'importance de demander : << de quelle
   juridiction >> ? Quelle est l'autorit \& eacute; l \& eacute;gale que
   nous acceptons implicitement et affirmons quand nous d \& eacute;signons
   un territoire d'une fa \& ccedil;on pr \& eacute;cise ? La question
   souligne que de nombreuses lois interviennent en politique mondiale,
   avant de laisser la possibilit \& eacute; aux chercheurs en RI critiques
   et postcoloniales d'assumer leurs choix entre les lois des colons et des
   indig \& egrave;nes.
   Este art \& iacute;culo considera algunos escritos cr \& iacute;ticos en
   materia del concepto de territorio dentro del \& aacute;mbito de las
   RRII, centr \& aacute;ndose en el trabajo reciente llevado a cabo sobre
   la jurisdicci \& oacute;n extraterritorial de los Estados Unidos. Estos
   escritos han estudiado de manera detallada las formas mediante las
   cuales la autoridad de los Estados Unidos excede, con frecuencia, los
   supuestos l \& iacute;mites territoriales de los Estados Unidos, pero no
   han tenido en cuenta la naturaleza controvertida y desigual de la
   autoridad de los Estados Unidos dentro de dichos l \& iacute;mites. En
   concreto, los estudios realizados dentro del \& aacute;mbito acad \&
   eacute;mico de las RRII no se han comprometido con las formas mediante
   las cuales la autoridad de los Estados Unidos ha sido, y es, cuestionada
   por las poblaciones y las naciones ind \& iacute;genas. Este fracaso es
   el producto de una suposici \& oacute;n arraigada en el coraz \&
   oacute;n de la disciplina: que las poblaciones ind \& iacute;genas se
   consideran como internas con relaci \& oacute;n a los Estados
   colonizadores o conquistadores. Sugerimos que, en la esencia de las
   asignaciones territoriales y las asignaciones llevadas a cabo dentro del
   \& aacute;mbito acad \& eacute;mico de las RRII se encuentran las
   suposiciones sobre la autoridad legal o la jurisdicci \& oacute;n y
   sobre qui \& eacute;n tiene jurisdicci \& oacute;n para definir y
   asignar la tierra, y qui \& eacute;n no. Demostramos, a trav \& eacute;s
   de una cr \& iacute;tica a estos supuestos, la importancia que tiene
   preguntarse: \& iquest;<< mediante qu \& eacute; jurisdicci \& oacute;n
   >>? \& iquest;Cu \& aacute;l es la autoridad legal que aceptamos y
   reivindicamos impl \& iacute;citamente cuando designamos territorio de
   maneras particulares? Esta pregunta reafirma que hay m \& uacute;ltiples
   leyes en juego dentro de la pol \& iacute;tica global, y abre un espacio
   para que los acad \& eacute;micos y cr \& iacute;ticos poscoloniales
   dentro del campo las RRII asuman la responsabilidad relativa a las
   elecciones que realizamos entre las leyes de los colonos y las leyes ind
   \& iacute;genas.},

Abstract = {This article poses the question of how incorporating the ``subjugated
   knowledge{''} of queer histories of the Troubles in Northern Ireland
   affects understandings of the conflict in international relations and
   security studies. It argues that while the centrality of the ``two
   communities{''} model drives all other issues to the political margins
   and perpetuates division, adopting a queer approach can deconstruct the
   identities of those communities and suggest ways to move beyond that
   model. It uses Jack Halberstam's queer methodology as a ``scavenger
   methodology{''} to draw on existing published interviews, as well as
   plays and films representing queer experiences during the Troubles, and
   a queer theoretical approach that seeks to both foreground queer
   experiences and challenge normative and binary understandings of
   identity in this context. Focusing on queer lives during the conflict
   reveals that constructing the identities of the two communities depends
   on excluding the queer subject, that queer people's security during the
   conflict was shaped by their queer identity, and that queerness can and
   has been mobilized to deconstruct received narratives and the apparently
   essential identities of the two communities, demonstrating some
   possibilities for dismantling the unionist/nationalist dichotomy.},

Abstract = {For Western intelligence communities, charged with providing advance
   notice of adverse developments around the world, Russia under Putin has
   had to become top priority for study, as was the Soviet Union during the
   Cold War. Using secret intelligence to help assess the motives and
   intent of the Kremlin leadership is essential but remains as hard, not
   least because of the extreme violence of the regime towards anyone
   suspected of betraying confidences to assist the West. Putin has
   provided his own explanation for his invasion of Ukraine in 2022 that
   illuminates his world view and belief in Russia as a Slavic nation, of
   which Ukraine is seen as part. Putin's background in the KGB is regime
   is seen as providing continuity with the brutal repressions of the
   Stalin era. The different methods used by Western intelligence to assess
   Russia are reviewed highlighting the additional digital sources
   available today. The warning failures of Western intelligence to provide
   strategic notice of Putin's aggressive actions are explained by
   inadequate situational awareness, erroneous explanation of his motives,
   leading to poor estimation of his subsequent moves, the exception being
   US and UK prediction of the 2022 invasion itself.},

Title = {Backsliding by Elite Collusion: Authoritarianism and Democratic
   Resurgence in Guatemala},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {712},
Number = {1, SI},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Guatemala is a case study in democratic backsliding led not by an
   aggrandized executive, but by a coalition of elites who collude to
   maximize and protect their collective power. Beginning in the mid-2010s,
   a decentralized but deeply entrenched network of elites dismantled
   democracy when anticorruption efforts threatened their common interests.
   The 2023 election was widely expected to consolidate this authoritarian
   turn but, instead, delivered an unexpected democratic resurgence when a
   moderate anticorruption reformer secured a shocking victory and then
   successfully resisted a ``slow-motion coup{''} aimed at preventing the
   transfer of power. The Guatemalan case suggests that, under elite
   collusion, elites can be more prone to splits and strategic errors than
   in other authoritarian settings. These missteps provide unexpected
   opportunities to reverse backsliding, but democrats must be prepared to
   capitalize on regime errors and repel authoritarian counteroffensives by
   building broad coalitions that work simultaneously across multiple
   arenas of democratic contestation.},

Abstract = {Feminist advocacy for `gender transformative' approaches to development,
   public policy and humanitarian action that account for social norms has
   surged in recent years. This article intervenes in the debate around
   norms and implications for transformative approaches. We draw on a
   unique set of quantitative, global `gender data' collected in 2020 and
   2021 and examine how social norms inform women's experiences of economic
   empowerment, as well as how these relationships map onto the current
   debates around interventions to address social norms and the form these
   interventions ought to take. Our data show that social norms matter for
   access to and control over resources; in addition, they illustrate that
   an individual belief in gender equality is fairly common around the
   world but that such individual beliefs frequently do not coincide with
   what people think their neighbours believe. These findings suggest a
   need for consideration of factors beyond individual attitudes towards
   and beliefs in gender-transformative interventions for women's economic
   empowerment.},

Abstract = {Rules lie at the core of many disciplines beneath regulatory studies.
   Such a broad interest inevitably comes with fragmented understandings
   and technical choices that hinder knowledge cumulation and learning.
   This introduction tackles these limitations through an encompassing
   analytical blueprint from measurement theory. First, it addresses
   ambiguities to establish formal rules as a distinct research object.
   Then, it builds on legal, institutional analytic, and computational
   linguistic frameworks to pinpoint their constituting elements. Last, it
   revises strategies for assigning meaningful numbers to objects and
   outlines how the contributions to this Special Issue foster different
   aspects of the blueprint.},

Abstract = {The US Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
   Organization has potentially profound implications for contraception.
   Contraceptives came up frequently in oral arguments and constitutional
   protections for abortion and birth control are fundamentally linked
   (Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 US 479, 1965). Moreover, in recent
   decisions (Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. 573 US 682, 2014) the
   court has endorsed the position of some religious groups that certain
   forms of contraception are ``abortifacients,{''} essentially a form of
   abortion. This legal blurring of distinct scientific boundaries between
   abortion and birth control provides legal pathways for birth control
   restrictions. That said, in the immediate wake of Dobbs, policy change
   on birth control has been limited, media coverage on the risks posed to
   birth control have been scarce, and public support of birth control
   access has remained robust. We review the current landscape of birth
   control politics and policy after Dobbs, including state and federal
   policy responses, elite rhetoric, interest group advocacy, media
   coverage, and public opinion. Our analysis contributes to an emerging
   literature on birth control politics and policy.},

Abstract = {After Dobbs, abortion access advocates try to make clear the harm of
   abortion criminalization. Two figures came to dominate the landscape:
   the reproductive martyr and the tragic abortion provider. Their stories
   focus on the threat to the health and life of women who need abortion
   for medical reasons. While such stories can produce sympathy for
   individuals and outrage at abortion bans, they occlude more important
   accounts of the loss of abortion rights that focus on the gender
   inequality of bodily violability. Understanding abortion rights as an
   issue of freedom and equality provides better grounds for understanding
   their loss.},

Title = {Developmental channels: (Incomplete) development strategies in
   democratic Latin America},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1210-1231},

Abstract = {In the early 2000s, Latin America witnessed a resurgence in debates
   concerning the state's economic role, coinciding with a political
   transformation as new parties emerged to power. Existing literature on
   the ``return of Industrial Policy{''} in the region largely offers a
   descriptive perspective, bypassing the intricacies of policy
   typifications and their associated political foundations. This paper
   addresses these gaps with two main contributions: First, it posits that
   the state's proactive economic interventions in Latin America were not
   comprehensive, but instead divided into two distinct channels: the
   sectoral and the macroeconomic. Second, by employing a fuzzy-set
   Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) of 59 democratic Latin American
   administrations, the paper delves into the political dynamics that
   underlie each channel. A detailed comparative analysis between Brazil
   and Chile serves as a focal point, illuminating their notable policy
   divergence. The research concludes that labor-supported parties are
   predisposed toward adopting active developmental roles, especially in
   contexts lacking complex economic structures. However, even incomplete
   strategies require the presence of robust developmental institutions and
   is contingent upon a government's capability to establish developmental
   coalitions and countervail opposing interests.},

Title = {Navigating Anxiety: International Politics, Identity Narratives, and
   Everyday Defense Mechanisms},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 3},
Abstract = {How do individuals navigate international politics and mitigate the
   anxieties it elicits in the everyday? Giddensian literature on
   ontological security suggests that (collective) internalized routines
   and narratives provide a sense of certainty and stability that enable
   individuals to ``go on{''} with their daily lives. This article adopts a
   Kleinian psychoanalytical approach to show that when faced with anxiety
   about their internalized narratives being ruptured, individuals do not
   necessarily, as Giddens suggests, fall into ``chaos.{''} Rather, they
   rely on psychodynamic defense mechanisms such as denial and idealization
   to protect their sense of self and, by extension, maintain a sense of
   ontological security. The article investigates everyday practices of how
   people cope with anxiety related to international politics. It focuses
   on the case of the European Union by analyzing the reactions to
   political cartoons of participants from eighteen focus groups conducted
   in Belgium, France, and Italy. The findings provide, in turn, a deeper
   understanding of individuals' everyday defense mechanisms in response to
   threats to collective narratives of being and belonging. The article
   thereby advances our theoretical and empirical knowledge of how
   international politics can affect individuals' everyday life and sense
   of self as well as shape political behavior and attitudes.
   Comment les individus s'y retrouvent-ils en politique internationale et
   attenuent l'anxiete qu'elle suscite au quotidien ? La litterature
   giddensienne sur la securite ontologique suggere que les routines et
   recits (collectifs) internalises offrent un sentiment de certitude et de
   stabilite qui permet a tout un chacun de vaquer a ses occupations. Cet
   article adopte une approche psychanalytique kleinienne pour montrer que
   lorsqu'ils ressentent de l'anxiete vis-a-vis d'une remise en question
   des recits internalises, les individus ne sombrent pas forcement dans le
   << chaos >>, comme le suggere Antony Giddens. Ils se reposent plutot sur
   des mecanismes de defense psychodynamiques, comme le deni ou
   l'idealisation, pour proteger leur sentiment de soi et, par extension,
   maintenir un sentiment de securite ontologique. L'article examine les
   pratiques quotidiennes qui permettent aux gens de vivre avec leur
   anxiete vis-a-vis de la politique internationale. Il se focalise sur le
   cas de l'Union europeenne en analysant les reactions a des caricatures
   politiques de participants issus de 18 groupes de discussion organises
   en Belgique, en France et en Italie. Les conclusions, quant a elles,
   ameliorent notre comprehension des mecanismes de defense employes au
   quotidien par les individus quand les recits collectifs du soi et de
   l'appartenance sont menaces. Aussi l'article avance-t-il nos
   connaissances theoriques et empiriques des effets de la politique
   internationale sur la vie quotidienne des personnes et leur sentiment de
   soi, ainsi que sur le comportement et les attitudes politiques.
   Como es la relacion de los individuos con la politica internacional y
   como mitigan las ansiedades que esta provoca en el dia a dia? La
   literatura giddensiana en materia de seguridad ontologica sugiere que
   las rutinas y narrativas (colectivas) internalizadas proporcionan una
   sensacion de certeza y estabilidad que permite a los individuos <<
   continuar >> con su vida cotidiana. Este articulo adopta un enfoque
   psicoanalitico kleiniano con el fin de demostrar que los individuos,
   cuando se enfrentan a la ansiedad de que sus narrativas internalizadas
   puedan llegar a desmoronarse, no caen necesariamente en el << caos >>,
   como sugiere Giddens. Por el contrario, mas bien, recurren a mecanismos
   de defensa psicodinamicos como la negacion y la idealizacion con el fin
   de proteger su sentido de si mismos y, por extension, con el fin de
   mantener una sensacion de seguridad ontologica. El articulo investiga
   las practicas cotidianas con relacion a como las personas lidian con la
   ansiedad relacionada con la politica internacional. El articulo se
   centra en el caso de la Union Europea analizando las reacciones a las
   caricaturas politicas de los participantes de 18 grupos focales
   realizados en Belgica, Francia e Italia. Las conclusiones proporcionan,
   a su vez, una comprension mas profunda de los mecanismos de defensa
   cotidianos de los individuos en respuesta a las amenazas contra las
   narrativas colectivas de ser y pertenecer. De este modo, el articulo
   proporciona nuevos avances en materia de nuestro conocimiento teorico y
   empirico acerca de como la politica internacional puede llegar a afectar
   a la vida cotidiana y al sentido de si mismos de los individuos, asi
   como a moldear el comportamiento y las actitudes politicas.},

Abstract = {Policymaking that aims to protect families and foster economic growth
   ought to be informed by a clear understanding of how employment,
   benefits, and family well-being interact. Here, we conduct a broad
   assessment of employment trends among low-income Americans, showing
   that, in recent decades, people with low income have become more highly
   educated and less likely to be married, and the share that is Hispanic
   has increased. We also find that these shifting characteristics do
   little to explain change in employment over time. Our findings also
   contribute to a growing literature that documents how social benefits
   for nonelderly adults increasingly reward and encourage work: benefits
   have become more generous to low-income adults with children who have
   substantial earnings, while they have remained relatively stable for
   childless adults. Low-income families with children and substantial
   earnings received more income from social benefits in the past decade
   than they did 30 years ago.},
