Abstract = {This paper investigates geography textbooks of the 1930s in Turkey,
   contending that geographical knowledge played a pivotal role in shaping
   nationhood within a modernising state. This study's critical discourse
   analysis (CDA) of the early republican geography textbooks showcases how
   (1) Turkey's spatial formation was reimagined in 1930s; (2) defining
   markers of Turkishness and the Turkish nation were forged through
   erasures and breakups of minority groups, and (3) the new national
   identity was ``bridged{''} to the geography of the newly founded
   Republic. This paper posits that a nation's portrayal of its geography
   and global positioning is not merely a factual recording, but also a
   reflection of ideological and political choices. Such portrayals are
   complete social constructs, inherently influenced by power dynamics and
   disputes. Beneath the ostensibly impartial depictions of space and
   spatial relations, invisible power dynamics and assertions underlie the
   assignments of specific meanings to geographic areas.},

Title = {``Always they look at you as a stranger{''}: affective encounters with
   the border among irregularised African migrants in Israel},
Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 18},
Abstract = {From 2005-2013, migrants travelled through Egypt's Sinai Desert to cross
   into Israel in search of asylum. The first were Sudanese people escaping
   conflict in Darfur, with Eritreans arriving subsequently. With no
   established legal framework for processing asylum claims, Israel's
   government prevented these migrants from making formal asylum
   applications, granting temporary collective protection, and began to use
   language of infiltration and policies of detention and deportation. In
   response, irregularised Africans organized a protest movement, claiming
   the right to a fair asylum process, the contours of which illustrated
   the complex entanglements of collective affects that were central to
   making a new political subject. The article asks how experiences of
   Israel's border regime disclosed a particular world, how the border was
   felt in affective encounters and relations through which migrants were
   hailed as infiltrators. The violence of bordering led to despair,
   stuckness, and dissipating hopes, but migrants' shared suffering also
   produced inter-connection and solidarity in ways that reflected the
   valuing of established identities as well as being together in
   difference. Positive and negative affects coexisted, the latter leading
   not to political inaction but demonstrating the generative potential of
   loss when it shapes shared affective spaces and expressions of
   collectivity.},

Abstract = {This study seeks to deepen our understanding of how Spanish-speaking
   Latinos interact with and view public lands and parks to shape policies
   that meet their needs. Employing Salt Lake City as a case study, a focus
   group was used to gather insights on community experiences with an
   emphasis on the importance of the proximity, maintenance, and safety of
   parks. The study supports findings found in existing literature
   regarding the significance of diversity, accessibility, inclusivity,
   livability, and cultural vibrancy in parks. However, it also brings
   attention to challenges that Spanish-speaking Latino communities
   encounter, such as lower usage rates, less diversity of people, and the
   necessity for parks to serve as substitutes for limited private outdoor
   areas. Furthermore, Spanish-speaking Latinos expressed concerns about
   losing parks to new developments in their community because of
   gentrification. The study emphasizes that addressing these issues is
   crucial for public lands and parks that promote stewardship,
   inclusivity, equity, and community welfare.},

Abstract = {Scholars have undertaken much conceptual development of
   ``polycentric{''} climate governance (PCG). Yet, there has been limited
   empirical examination of whether this descriptive, analytical, and
   normative concept can aid climate change mitigation; it may even
   undermine our efforts in certain contexts. Thus this special issue
   examines the empirical realities of PCG. Building from a shared
   definition of the concept, the constitutive articles analyze an
   exploratory range of systems, across policy styles, governance levels,
   and types of actors. Here we consolidate the findings of the articles by
   identifying five key themes that are drawn from across the special
   issue, for consideration in future research. These themes are
   operationalization of PCG systems; voluntary action; temporality; power;
   and, crucially, effectiveness in mitigating climate change. Our findings
   provide evidence from a wide range of contexts, from which we build to
   propose new research streams on this topic.},

Abstract = {The Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought war back to the European
   continent and led to considerable change in EU member states' foreign
   policies. The consequential degree of EU foreign policy unity, as well
   as shifts in long-lasting national and collective security and defence
   taboos, has represented a significant departure from past practices. We
   use these processes of change as a starting point to set the scene for
   this special issue and to inform its main research question: in what
   manner, if at all, has the EU come of age as a foreign and security
   actor during Russia's war on Ukraine? This introduction situates the
   main question of the special issue into the wider scholarly debates on
   actorness and the EU's geopolitical ambitions. It conceptually develops
   the analogy of ``coming of age{''} to examine a prospective maturation
   process of the EU as a foreign and security actor. In doing so, it not
   only interrogates what the EU as a mature foreign and security actor
   would look like, but it also develops the framework, identifies four
   maturation processes and reflects on necessary caveats for drawing
   inferences about the state of maturation of the EU as foreign and
   security actor.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an innovative experience involving students and
   professors from diverse backgrounds and regions that was designed to
   integrate corporate sustainability (CS) knowledge into undergraduate
   programs. An action research approach was adopted, with the course
   running over one semester. The course involved 146 students with diverse
   academic backgrounds from universities across Brazil along with eight
   professors from Brazil, Chile, and South Africa. The proposed approach
   provides actionable insights into the integration of sustainability
   concepts in the higher educational setting, thereby contributing to the
   development of a more environmentally and socially conscious generation
   of professionals. The learning outcomes are discussed in the light of
   the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Agenda, particularly SDG 7
   (affordable and clean energy), SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and
   infrastructure), and SDG 13 (climate action). In addition, it is
   important to highlight that the dissemination of the course's key
   features can be useful for universities, professors, and researchers
   engaged in training future professionals capable of addressing
   real-world problems of innovation and sustainability. By employing an
   action research methodology and fostering collaboration among students
   and professors with diverse academic backgrounds and from different
   countries, including Brazil, Chile, and South Africa, this paper
   presents a multiregional and interdisciplinary perspective that sets it
   apart from conventional practices. The emphasis on providing actionable
   insights and its potential applicability for universities, professors,
   and researchers involved in training future professionals further
   underscore its distinctive contribution to education for sustainable
   development.},

Title = {Synthetic Replacements for Human Survey Data? The Perils of Large
   Language Models},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 17},
Abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) offer new research possibilities for social
   scientists, but their potential as ``synthetic data{''} is still largely
   unknown. In this paper, we investigate how accurately the popular LLM
   ChatGPT can recover public opinion, prompting the LLM to adopt different
   ``personas{''} and then provide feeling thermometer scores for 11
   sociopolitical groups. The average scores generated by ChatGPT
   correspond closely to the averages in our baseline survey, the 2016-2020
   American National Election Study (ANES). Nevertheless, sampling by
   ChatGPT is not reliable for statistical inference: there is less
   variation in responses than in the real surveys, and regression
   coefficients often differ significantly from equivalent estimates
   obtained using ANES data. We also document how the distribution of
   synthetic responses varies with minor changes in prompt wording, and we
   show how the same prompt yields significantly different results over a
   3-month period. Altogether, our findings raise serious concerns about
   the quality, reliability, and reproducibility of synthetic survey data
   generated by LLMs.},

Abstract = {After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, EU enlargement rebounded from the
   sidelines to take centre stage in the European debate. The overall
   support of the EU towards Kyiv was framed by a sudden moral imperative
   to help Ukraine enter the EU even though it had been stuck in the
   perpetual waiting room of Eastern Partnership for quite some time.
   France repeatedly attempted to form a pan-European body and created the
   European Political Community (EPC), allegedly intended primarily to help
   Ukraine. However, France has had an ambiguous attitude to EU enlargement
   which is domestically a politically sensitive topic. We examined to what
   extent a rationalist or securitisation-driven stance to EU enlargement
   prevails in France. To do so, an analysis of the geopolitical ambitions
   of France in Central and Eastern Europe together with its pan-European
   projects such as EPC was carried out. Our analysis proves that despite
   all the political statements of support for the EU candidate states, the
   French ruling elite and society do not favour enlargement. Potential
   member states are securitised in the political discourse and potential
   cons of their entry are emphasised. Moreover, French president Emmanuel
   Macron openly stated he expects the accession process of Ukraine would
   take decades.},

Abstract = {There are many different types of terrorist attacks, but some types of
   terrorist attacks are infrequent. One example of an infrequent attack
   type is one that employs chemical, biological, and radiological weapons.
   There are also types of attacks that have never happened, such as a
   nuclear terrorist attack. Given the lack of historical incidents, how
   can counterterrorism researchers, policymakers, and practitioners
   utilise a data-driven approach to analyse these types of attacks? To
   address this question, we introduce the Automated Adversary Template
   Generation (AATG) process to generate synthetic terrorist incidents that
   are realistic. The AATG process uses semi-stochastic sampling to
   simulate terrorist adversary behaviours and activities and produce
   thousands of CBRNE terrorist attack scenarios. Using these scenarios,
   individuals researching and working in counterterrorism can analyse
   possible on-the-horizon Weapons of Mass Destruction/Terror (WMD/WMT)
   attacks and explore these threat spaces with greater fidelity. In
   particular, this novel methodology is very useful for red teaming
   purposes conducted by researchers or counterterrorism practitioners.},

Abstract = {There has been little empirical or conceptual work on conspiracy
   theories within a policing context. This gap is concerning given
   emerging evidence suggesting that conspiracy beliefs can have
   significant consequences in several important personal, social, and
   political dimensions. Some of these consequences may also impact both
   the operational environment of policing and the police workforce. To
   address the research gap, this study reviewed research into conspiracy
   antecedents applicable to police work conditions, the nature of police,
   and police officers to identify a core set of antecedents which may lead
   to conspiracy thinking in policing. To account for the often context
   dependent nature of policing, case studies were drawn from the
   Australian and New Zealand context, identified using the open-source
   intelligence (OSINT) method. 12 case studies were ultimately identified
   as suitable for inclusion. Applying the core set of antecedents to the
   case studies through content analysis revealed that cynicism related to
   policing organisations or police work is a key antecedent, alongside the
   `social function' antecedent where conspiracy theories serve to protect
   a group from perceived threats. Lastly, to provide practical guidance to
   police organisations and leadership, the article proposes four possible
   intervention strategies against conspiracy theories in policing.},

Abstract = {Creating an environmentally aware society is not an easy task and
   requires knowledge about what affects the formation of environmental
   views. At the same time, to contribute to environmental protection,
   individuals with different educational backgrounds need to have
   environmental awareness, because their decisions as future professionals
   may affect the environment. The problem, however, is that there is not
   adequate research on the association between educational background and
   environmental views. To address this gap, the aim of this study is to
   investigate whether scientific background affects environmental views
   and attitudes. Specific objectives are to examine whether scientific
   background affects university students' views on environmental issues as
   well as their attitudes towards the solution to environmental problems.
   To achieve this aim, a comparative study was performed on two student
   groups: students attending environmental studies and students attending
   classical studies. The results showed that non-environmental students
   were less willing to change their habits to protect the environment and
   to participate in environmental actions compared to environmental
   students who expressed a pronounced willingness to do so. However, both
   student groups did not acknowledge their personal environmental
   responsibility. Categorical regression revealed that students' certain
   sociodemographic variables affected their willingness to change habits.
   However, other additional variables are recommended to be analyzed in
   future studies. The results from this study provide support for making
   changes in the curricula of non-environmental departments and for
   carrying out actions to reinforce the participation of students in
   initiatives aimed at raising environmental awareness.},

Abstract = {In 2002, a few months after 9/11, I published one of the very first
   academic examinations of environmental terrorism: what was included in
   this term and what wasn't, who might commit such terrorism, and what
   sorts of environmental resources were vulnerable. Since then, it has
   been the subject of academic and government analyses. Now, twenty years
   later, it is time to revisit the concept in light of worsening
   anthropogenic climate change, the rise of authoritarian states and
   ecofascism, and gray-zone conflicts in international relations.},

Abstract = {In 2018, 70 years after it was founded, the State of Israel accepted a
   new nationality law, one which reshaped the identity of the state.
   Supporters of this constitutional law argue that it is necessary since
   the Jewish-national character of the state is under threat, and since
   liberal-democratic principles and policies have acquired undesired
   dominance in public life. The nationality law, however, does much more
   than restore a lost or imagined collective identity: it is a significant
   setback to both the liberal and republican understandings of a
   democratic state, as well as to Jewish-Arab relations. More broadly
   still, the law displays the growing distance between the ethical and
   political spheres in Israel; this distance is expressed in the law's
   remarkable modifications of the three Zionist revolutions pertaining to
   the material (land), the linguistic and the political-communal
   dimensions of Jewish, national life.},

Title = {Still on the same path? Italian foreign and defence policy in the
   Enlarged Mediterranean},

Abstract = {What is the vital strategic area for Italian foreign and defence policy?
   As a G-7 member and prominent contributor to international security with
   leading roles in NATO, UN and EU missions, Italy's regional and global
   outlook deserves specific attention. For years, Italian governments have
   attributed relevance to the `Enlarged Mediterranean' (EM) as a crucial
   region for protecting and promoting national interests. Yet, after
   Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the rising strategic competition in
   Asia, some authors have observed a significant expansion of Italy's
   foreign and defence policy towards Eastern Europe and the Indo-Pacific.
   Thus, one might question whether the strategic significance of the EM
   for Italy has diminished due to the growing political, economic, and
   military engagement in other regions. Despite the above-mentioned
   novelties, this paper argues that `Enlarged Mediterranean' still
   represents the most relevant `path' for Italian foreign and defence
   policy. Relying on secondary and primary sources (interviews with
   Ministers, Undersecretaries, MPs, Generals, and experts; official
   documents; etc.), the manuscript assesses our claim, paving the way for
   further broader reflection on the future of Italian (and European)
   foreign policy.},

Abstract = {How do Georgian political elites frame the EU and EU integration in
   their discourse? Why do they simultaneously support and contest the EU?
   How does the membership perspective recently opened for Georgia alter
   this discourse and contestation? In this chapter, we argue that the EU
   became the cornerstone of domestic political struggle in Georgia. Local
   elites regard the EU and EU integration as a strategic process,
   producing new opportunities and challenges. They contextualize events
   related to the EU and EU integration through the lenses of their
   interests and expectations. This reveals the limits of the EU's
   transformative power, and therefore conditionality, even within the
   membership perspective, especially in the liminal periphery with
   competing forces such as Russia. Along with secondary data regarding
   Georgia-EU relations, the chapter draws on original interviews with
   members of the Georgian parliament, both from the ruling party and the
   opposition, and their public statements.},

Title = {Racing whiteness in Asian bodies: The influence of American conservatism
   on Singaporean anti-colonial nationalism},
Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 29},
Abstract = {In contemporary Singaporean sociopolitical discourse, comparisons with
   the West-particularly the USA and the UK-have become pervasive across a
   wide range of critical social issues. These comparisons often serve to
   reinforce the political positions of the Singaporean state by
   contrasting them with perceived shortcomings in the Western world.
   Utilizing a linguistic anthropological framework, this paper explores
   the phenomenon of anti-colonial nationalism, wherein state
   representatives dismiss challenges to the Singaporean status quo as
   unpatriotic, Western-influenced, and thus dangerously ``white.{''} By
   demonstrating how Singapore's anti-colonial politics is paradoxically
   shaped by the anti-liberal and populist rhetoric of the contemporary
   American right, this paper argues that anti-colonialism is a product of
   twenty-first-century neoliberal nationalism. Underscoring the importance
   of examining how political rhetoric crosses international borders, this
   study seeks to invite a conversation on the dynamics of nationalist
   discourses in the twenty-first century, and how the language of
   decolonization can be co-opted by new forms of state power and control
   through a racing of ``whiteness.{''}},

Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},

Month = {2024 DEC 29},
Abstract = {Theory suggests that the meaning of identity categories can vary across
   populations and change with time. By implication, the analytical
   usefulness of a given category as a measure of ethnic identity can also
   change, varying along with its cognitive and social usefulness to the
   examined population. In a prior study, we claimed that the usefulness of
   different measures of ethnic identity in Ukraine had changed in response
   to a revolution and the initiation of violent conflict with Russia in
   2014. We now test this theory with new data on a new cataclysm, Russia's
   2022 full-blown invasion of Ukraine. Our analysis confirms that
   international conflict enhances the usefulness of categories related to
   external delimitation from foreigners while rendering less useful those
   pertaining to internal differentiation in Ukrainian society.},

Title = {Drinking Water Quality Management for Broiler Performance and Carcass
   Characteristics},

Abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to assess the impact of water quality as
   determined by its physical, chemical, and biological composition
   collected from five distinct points in Maragheh, Iran, on the
   performance and carcass traits of Ross-308 commercial broilers (mix of
   male and female) during the grower (11-24 days) and finisher (25-42
   days) periods. Materials and methods: A total of 240 broilers were
   involved in the study, divided into five treatments with four replicates
   and 12 birds per replicate. In this study, a randomized design was used.
   Water samples were collected from five different points, and broilers
   were provided with these water sources during the grower and finisher
   periods. Water samples for testing were prepared from the water wells of
   the meat poultry farms located in the northern, eastern, western, and
   southern lands, and the experimental farm, using hygienic and scientific
   methods. Performance parameters, including body weight, feed conversion
   ratio (FCR), and water intake, were measured. Results: During the grower
   period, no significant effects on performance and water intake were
   observed across the different water sources (p > 0.05). However, in the
   finisher period, significant differences were noted (p >= 0.05). The use
   of water from point A (control group) led to reduced water consumption,
   body weight, and increased FCR (p < 0.05). The northern water source
   exhibited the optimum FCR during the finisher period (p < 0.05).
   Throughout the entire experimental period, the water source
   significantly influenced broiler performance, with the northern water
   source (point B) corresponding with the highest weight gain and
   production index with the least feed intake (p < 0.05). Despite these
   variations, no significant changes were observed in the broilers'
   carcass traits across different water sources (p >= 0.05). Conclusions:
   In conclusion, the study revealed that various drinking water sources,
   while not significantly impacting carcass quality traits, exerted
   notable effects on broilers' performance. The northern water source
   emerged as particularly favorable, demonstrating superior weight gain
   and a production index with efficient feed utilization. These findings
   underscore the importance of water quality in poultry management,
   particularly during the finisher period, and highlight its potential
   influence on broiler performance.},

Abstract = {Since proclaiming independence in 1960, Senegal has faced economic and
   demographic imbalances across its regions. To address these disparities,
   the government launched decentralization policies in three major phases,
   aiming to stimulate socio-economic growth at the local level. This study
   examines the impact of these policies on urban-rural development using
   socio-economic data between 2000 and 2020, and a multiple linear
   regression model in the entirety of Senegal. The findings reveal
   significant correlations between rural population growth, access to
   electricity, fertilizer availability, and per capita cultivated land,
   all positively associated with agricultural productivity. Additionally,
   rapid urbanization (47.3\%) and weak land tenure (88.6\%) adversely
   affect ecological systems and contribute to the proliferation of slums.
   A notable lack of health facilities per capita highlights a severe gap
   in healthcare accessibility. The study suggests increasing agricultural
   income, creating jobs, and promoting policies that support rural
   collective entrepreneurship as critical steps. It also recommends
   adopting a ``one ecological zone, one economic activity{''} strategy to
   reduce economic disparities and encourage sustainable development in
   rural Senegal.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a normative justification regarding the fairness of
   `coercively' protecting minority languages in mixed societies where the
   minority group already knows the majority language. To do so, it adopts
   first a theory-testing approach and examines, by using the Catalan case,
   the validity of the arguments presented in Morales-G \& aacute;lvez's
   (2017) `protectionist' theory of linguistic justice. In this vein, it
   argues that some of the ideas this author uses to defend the `coercive'
   protection of minority languages still work when the minority group is
   bilingual. Yet, there are others that appear to be problematic. As such,
   this paper then unfolds using a theory-building approach and reframes
   these concepts with the objective of proposing complementary arguments.
   This article concludes that `coercive' policies to protect the language
   of a bilingualised minority group are fair and necessary if they aim to
   accomplish active reciprocal bilingualism and hence ensure equal rights
   for all speakers.},

Abstract = {This speech forecasts continued US government resolve to counter
   multifaceted and often very serious challenges posed by the behavior of
   the government of the People's Republic of China, and accompanying
   greater American support for Taiwan. It explains the reasons for US
   resolve developed over the past six years, highlighting the role of
   bi-partisan majorities in Congress. It anticipates smooth continuity in
   the US government resolve if President Biden is reelected and some
   serious complications if the former President Trump is reelected, though
   the hardening of US policy against China will endure.},

   do not prevent fraud, they can instill confidence in voting. However,
   this reasoning ignores the historical and contemporary racial biases in
   the enactment and administration of restrictive voting policies in the
   United States. This legacy likely colors the extent to which Black and
   white voters see reforms as deterring fraud versus increasing
   suppression, and as such, how confident they are in election outcomes.
   We examine how increasing voter restrictions affects voter fraud beliefs
   and voter confidence among Black and white voters. We find that the
   enactment of restrictive policies decreases fraud beliefs among white
   voters but has no effect on fraud beliefs for Black voters; however,
   Black voters are less confident in elections when conducted with more
   restrictive policies while white voters are not. Finally, we find
   suggestive evidence that the racial gap in the effects of restrictive
   voting policies on voter confidence is partially undergirded by racial
   elite signaling.},

Abstract = {Following the 2017 siege of Marawi, the Philippines' counter-terrorism
   approach has grappled with an increasingly fragmented and unpredictable
   landscape. Despite claims of victory, the aftermath of Marawi
   underscores the need to reassess and critique the country's
   counter-terrorism strategy. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis
   of the post-Marawi terrorist environment and evaluates the efficacy of
   strategies adopted by Philippine security forces. While detailing
   changes in strategy, policy and capacity-building efforts, the paper
   argues that the focus on the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in Sulu has
   overshadowed broader security concerns, including the resurgence and the
   proliferation of other rebels. The paper concludes that 7 years after
   Marawi, while steps have been taken in the right direction, the
   opportunity to fundamentally reset counterterrorism has been squandered.
   A more nuanced and comprehensive approach requiring further investment
   and infrastructure is needed. This represents the first assessment of
   both the new military and non-military interventions by the Philippine
   state. The analysis reveals how US security assistance to the
   Philippines has become more politicized on anti-corruption and human
   rights issues and how progressive policy changes will be undone if
   Marawi itself is not rescued from bad governance and the neglect of the
   community that lost the most.},

Abstract = {The European Union experienced several significant crises before the
   eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic that could result in paradigmatic
   changes that advance either the EU's coordination or its disintegration.
   This paper investigates responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and
   explains the policy changes during the crisis using a comparative
   framework of neo-functionalism and intergovernmentalism in European
   integration theory. Tracking integration theories and comparing the new
   dynamics arising from the pandemic, we demonstrate that the pandemic has
   intensified long-standing trends in EU governance, resulting in the
   shift in EU governance during the pandemic being interpreted as both a
   reconceptualization of interests and a reframing of norms. The pandemic
   is therefore a wake-up call for the EU about the lack of deep European
   integration and incremental change, particularly with respect to the
   EU's relative ineffectiveness in influencing its members' health
   policies and reforms.},

Abstract = {Agriculture subsidies are estimated to increase by US\$ 2 Trillion in
   2030. Many countries are critical of policies such as market price
   support and input subsidies due to their adverse environmental impacts,
   climate change, and biodiversity loss. Recently, in addition to trade
   distortion, environmental concerns are playing a crucial role in
   disciplining agriculture subsidies at the WTO. Many members and
   international organisations have called for a substantial reduction in
   the subsidy entitlement of individual members to address these concerns.
   The reduction is proposed to be proportionate to the size of the
   members' current and future trade-distorting entitlements. The paper
   examines whether the proposed methodology to discipline agriculture
   subsidies promotes agriculture sustainability from the perspective of
   social, economic, and environmental concerns. The results suggest that
   the proposals based on proportionate methodology undermine not only
   social and economic sustainability but also leave the existing
   imbalances in the AoA unaddressed, disregard special and differential
   treatment, and negate the decade-long efforts made by developing country
   members in finding a permanent solution for public stockholding for food
   security.},

Abstract = {The populist radical right (PRR) has been actively engaged in the
   discursive struggle over the notion of democracy in Europe and beyond.
   This article examines how in practice PRR parties discursively construct
   and manipulate the concept of democracy. By taking a longitudinal
   comparative perspective on the political discourse of Jaros \& lstrok;aw
   Kaczy \& nacute;ski, the leader of the Polish Law and Justice (PiS)
   party, in five consecutive electoral campaigns between 2007 and 2023,
   the article identifies key discursive strategies used to construct PRR
   conceptions of democracy. The analysis of PiS's discourse in government
   and opposition shows that the PRR strives to fully appropriate the
   concept of democracy: when in power, the PRR discursively constructs
   (preserving) democracy as inseparable from the political status quo;
   while in opposition, it conditions (restoring) democracy with its
   accession to power. Despite numerous references to majoritarian
   conceptions of democracy and plebiscitary mechanisms and its claims to
   promote a radical democratic renewal, the PRR tends not to question the
   underlying principles of parliamentary representation. In practice, it
   discursively constructs a severely restricted version of democracy in
   which democratic participation essentially boils down to participation
   in elections. Hence, references to democracy are primarily used by the
   PRR to (emotionally) mobilise voters.},

Abstract = {In the years following the 2011 overthrow of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali,
   the international democracy promotion community enthusiastically
   embraced Tunisia's burgeoning civil society. Ten years later, however,
   when the democratically-elected president Kais Saied began to dismantle
   the country's democratic institutions, civil society largely stood on
   the side-lines. This paper examines what happened during the intervening
   decade that left civil society's international funders so disappointed.
   The paper finds that three key changes over time help explain the gap
   between donor expectations and what civil society ultimately delivered:
   the development of an antagonistic and uncooperative relationship
   between civil society and the state; differences between Tunisian civil
   society activists and international donors on the types of issues they
   prioritized and other matters; and an overall lack of trust and lack of
   cohesion among civil society activists in working towards common goals -
   despite some successful coalition work around particular legislation -
   which came on full display after July 2021. This paper contributes to
   studies of Tunisian civil society's development process in the context
   of its transition experience between 2011 and 2021, and of how and why
   donors continue to `miss the mark' in their efforts to support civil
   society as a means of promoting democracy.},

Abstract = {When researchers design an experiment, they usually hold potentially
   relevant features of the experiment constant. We call these details the
   ``topic{''} of the experiment. For example, researchers studying the
   impact of party cues on attitudes must inform respondents of the
   parties' positions on a particular policy. In doing so, researchers
   implement just one of many possible designs . Clifford, Leeper, and
   Rainey (2023. ``Generalizing Survey Experiments Using Topic Sampling: An
   Application to Party Cues.{''} Forthcoming in Political Behavior.
   https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-023-09870-1) argue that researchers
   should implement many of the possible designs in parallel-what they call
   ``topic sampling{''}-to generalize to a larger population of topics. We
   describe two estimators for topic-sampling designs: First, we describe a
   nonparametric estimator of the typical effect that is unbiased under the
   assumptions of the design; and second, we describe a hierarchical model
   that researchers can use to describe the heterogeneity. We suggest
   describing the heterogeneity across topics in three ways: (1) the
   standard deviation in treatment effects across topics, (2) the treatment
   effects for particular topics, and (3) how the treatment effects for
   particular topics vary with topic-level predictors. We evaluate the
   performance of the hierarchical model using the Strengthening Democracy
   Challenge megastudy and show that the hierarchical model works well.},

Abstract = {This article sheds new light on the Aramean movement in northern Israel,
   drawing from studies on nationalism, racialisation, ethnic conflict and
   minority mobilisation. In 2014, Israel allowed members of several
   churches to identify as Aramean. The pivotal role in the Aramean
   minority's distancing of itself from the Arab identity was played by the
   Israeli Christian Aramaic Association (ICAA). Specifying and partially
   adapting Yusri Hazran's concept of `Druzification', meaning the
   Israelis' conscious policy of minoritising indigenous populations and
   encouraging their conscription to the army, the term `Druzification from
   below' is proposed to stress the bottom-up character of the Aramean
   movement in the north of the country as well as the agency of Middle
   Eastern Christians. My general standpoint is that `Druzification from
   below' can be perceived as an adaptive strategy-a survival response to
   structural political conditions and urbicidal practices of the
   ethnocratic state and adaptation to external threats.},

Abstract = {Political polarization is a systemic-level and multifaceted process that
   severs cross-cutting ties and shifts perceptions of politics to a
   zero-sum game. When it turns pernicious, political actors and supporters
   view opponents as an existential threat and the capacity of democratic
   institutions to process political conflict breaks down. The article
   identifies four common fault lines of polarization globally - who
   belongs, democracy, inequality and social contract. It argues that while
   Latin American countries experience, to varying degrees, all four of the
   fault lines, it is the deep-seated, persistent social hierarchies
   oriented around class, race, and place that stand out relative to other
   countries. Reaching consensus on reforms that may renew or reformulate
   agreements on the terms of the social contract, boundaries of community
   membership, and redressing social inequality is a tall task. Yet the
   region's sustained consensus on the democratic rules of the game can
   provide the mechanisms for addressing this task if new majority
   coalitions can be formed.},

   Applying Edith Stein\&apos;s theory of the state},
Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 4},
Abstract = {To get a better picture of the relation between nationalism and global
   environmental problems within the state-dominated situation, I present
   the inherent logic of international environmental politics as a version
   of the famous Prisoner's Dilemma. I argue that the same contingent bonds
   that relate the members of nations to their respective nation-states are
   part of the contemporary difficulty of actually working together for the
   common good on the international level by creating exclusive feelings of
   solidarity-the `Prisoners' of the Dilemma. To reveal the experiential
   background of nation-states in this situation, I rephrase and apply
   Edith Stein's theory of the state as a collective entity. Stein was an
   inter-war political philosopher who is now mainly read within religious
   studies and philosophy of mind. As my argument implies, her work also
   has relevance for further affect nationalism studies.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a novel method of assessing the risk that online
   users will engage in acts of violent extremism based on linguistic
   markers detectable in terrorist manifestos. A comparative NLP analysis
   was carried out across fifteen manifestos on a scale from violent
   terrorist to non-violent politically moderate. We used a dictionary
   approach to measure the statistical significance of narratives
   previously identified in terrorism literature in predicting violence.
   The NLP analysis confirmed our research hypothesis, finding that the
   linguistic markers of identity fusion (an extreme form of group
   alignment whereby personal and group identities become functionally
   equivalent), dehumanising language towards the out-group and violence
   condoning norms were statistically significantly higher in manifestos of
   authors who engaged in acts of violent extremism. Building on our prior
   qualitative text analysis of terrorist manifestos, this study is among
   the first to offer a statistical analysis of the narrative patterns and
   associated linguistic markers distilled from terrorist manifestos.
   Beyond its academic contribution, the assessment framework presented
   here might assist security and counter-terrorism professionals in using
   psycholinguistic indicators to estimate the risk that online users will
   engage in offline violence and to make decisions on internal resource
   allocation in ongoing investigations.},

Abstract = {Previous research has found that entrapment - inducing suspects to
   commit crimes they were not already predisposed to commit - is
   widespread in US terrorism sting operations, particularly those
   involving Muslims and racial minorities. To test whether the sunk cost
   effect and/or intergroup biases could explain decisions to authorise
   these operations, we conducted an experiment in which college student
   and MTurk participants (n = 1009) from the US and India decided whether
   to approve an operation featuring apparent entrapment. Sunk costs and
   suspect characteristics were manipulated across experimental conditions.
   Results for US participants (n = 792) show that high sunk costs
   increased approval of the operation only for relatively young
   participants, and only in scenarios with non-Muslim suspects. Scenarios
   with Muslim suspects yielded higher approval rates for participants who
   were confident in their decision. Indian participants (n = 217) were
   more likely than US participants to approve the operation and were
   unaffected by suspect religion and sunk costs. Results suggest that the
   sunk cost bias may play some role in entrapment, although other factors,
   such as outgroup bias, may also contribute to these decisions. The
   observed cross-cultural differences could result from international
   variations in susceptibility to the sunk cost effect, among other
   factors.},

Abstract = {A highly controlled experimental setting using a sample of questions
   from the European Social Survey (ESS) and European Values Study (EVS)
   was used to test the effects of integrating machine translation and
   post-editing into the Translation, Review, Adjudication, Pretesting, and
   Documentation (TRAPD) approach in survey translation. Four experiments
   were conducted in total, two concerning the language pair English-German
   and two in the language pair English-Russian. The overall results of
   this study are positive for integrating machine translation and
   post-editing into the TRAPD process, when translating survey
   questionnaires. The experiments show evidence that in German and Russian
   languages and for a sample of ESS and EVS survey questions, the effect
   of integrating machine translation and post-editing on the quality of
   the review outputs-with quality understood as texts output with the
   fewest errors possible-can hardly be distinguished from the quality that
   derives from the setting with human translations only.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to explore how past experiences impact the credibility
   of external states and change their public statements regarding other
   civil conflicts. While existing research on third-party intervention
   often explores the reasons behind external states' involvement in
   conflicts, there has been a notable oversight in understanding how
   verbal expressions evolve across diverse conflicts. The paper compares
   the United States' presidential statements regarding the Bosnia and
   Kosovo conflicts and highlights how the United States employs different
   frames for these distinct conflicts to restore its credibility. The
   paper concludes by proposing the need for a new measure of third-party
   attitudes towards civil conflicts to gain a more nuanced understanding
   of the role of external states in civil conflicts by measuring their
   resolve.},

Abstract = {Disinformation has become a central topic in the European Union (EU)
   since the mid-2010s due to the disinformation campaigns used by the
   Russian Federation during the hybrid war against Ukraine in 2014, the
   Brexit referendum, the 2017 French presidential election and the 2019
   European Parliamentary (EP) election. This paper aims to provide an
   overview and analysis of the EU's counter-disinformation policy and
   measures within the theoretical framework of militant and defensive
   democracy with the aim to fill the gap in the relevant literature. The
   paper hypothesises that the concepts of militant and defensive democracy
   are applicable to the EU in its fight against foreign interference and
   disinformation. The main research questions are: What kind of measures
   has the EU developed to counter disinformation? Can we identify rights
   restrictive measures, in other words, does the EU follow a militant
   strategy in defending its democratic order? The paper finds that
   democratic self-defence is a crucial contemporary issue for the EU
   regarding foreign interference and more specifically disinformation, and
   that the concepts of militant and defensive democracy provide
   appropriate theoretical framework for analysing not only the challenges
   of democracy emerging inside the EU, but threats from the outside as
   well.},

Abstract = {Defence effort is often discussed in terms of relative military spending
   - as \% of GDP. The aggregate nature of this measure, however, hides
   important within-budget dynamics. Specifically, states have to make hard
   choices about distributing their spending among personnel and equipment
   expenditures. NATO has adopted a recommendation that 20\% of the defence
   budget should go to equipment. Our paper contributes to the emerging
   literature on determinants of personnel vs. equipment share. We perform
   panel data regression on NATO countries between 2005 and 2019. Our
   results indicate that (i) equipment is more elastic to overall military
   expenditures than personnel, and (which is a novel contribution of our
   paper) (ii) that larger All-Volunteer Forces (AVF) create demands for
   increased personnel spending even well after the transitioning period,
   (iii) How mature is the AVF plays no role, while relative personnel
   costs is an important predictor. The second result yields especially
   important implications for the renewed policy debates on the limits of
   the AVF model in the context of European security.},

Abstract = {Transnational governance initiatives (TGIs) are increasingly recognized
   as central actors in the governing of climate change and biodiversity
   loss. Yet, their role in linking these domains has yet to be explored.
   As the climate crisis comes to be increasingly interlinked with the loss
   of biodiversity, such initiatives are increasingly combining this
   challenge of climate change with action on biodiversity loss through the
   deployment of nature-based solutions, with significant consequences for
   the ways in which the nature problem and its solutions are framed and
   implemented. Employing a governmentality approach, this research reveals
   two overarching rationales by TGIs of biodiversity as a means to climate
   change and ``asset-at-risk{''} that are rendered governable through
   myriad techniques ``at a distance{''} and ``in proximity.{''} By
   revealing how biodiversity is made to fit with the climate arena, this
   research finds that these governable biodiversity spaces could generate
   rather regrettable solutions along these shifting and unfolding
   climate-biodiversity frontiers.},

Abstract = {This paper begins by reviewing rational choice institutionalism's
   explanation of how political institutions incentivise patronage networks
   emphasising ethnic cleavage. Acknowledging the limits of rationalist
   institutionalism in explaining societal norm constructions and mass
   behaviour, the paper then adopts discursive institutionalism to analyse
   the social affects of institutional design. The case study of violence
   against Amharas deemed `settlers' in Ethiopia's contemporary ethnic
   federation highlights how new cleavages create new norms and new
   historical narratives, influencing group dynamics. These dynamics result
   in group-based mass violence when rents-based orders and patronage
   networks collapse during times of institutional instability or change.
   Thus, precipitated by the discursive effects of hyper-ethnicised
   institutional design, mass violence against Amhara in different ethnic
   regions in Ethiopia emerges as an unexpected outcome of regime change
   and democratic transition in the country. These incidents of targeted
   violence are not simply explained by institutions, but rather by the
   socio-political climate effected by the interaction between institutions
   and discourse under ethnic federalism. In short, this study demonstrates
   how institutions go beyond incentivising or constraining elite
   behaviour, producing discursive markers that normalise violence during
   periods of institutional `lapse', when formal provisions of social order
   temporarily collapse.},

Abstract = {Robotised propaganda has become a new stage in the dissemination of
   manipulative content online, exploited for its low entry costs and high
   effectiveness. State actors, non-state actors, and politically and
   business-focused actors can spread ideas, share thoughts or sow
   half-truths and lies with the help of hundreds of automatised accounts
   and contribute to the manipulation of people's minds. In a short time,
   robotised propaganda gained the attention of academics as well as
   international organisations. Especially, Russian influence operations
   utilising the newest advantages of technological development stand at
   the epicentre of research interests in the Central and Eastern European
   region. In our research, we aim to test the hypothesis that information
   from media which are presented as pro-Russian were connected to a higher
   percentage of accounts classified as bots. The research sample covers
   all the media categories in the Czech Republic, as stated by the
   Political Capital study `The Weaponization of Culture: Kremlin's
   traditional agenda and the export of values to Central Europe'. For
   robotised accounts activity analysis, we use a script based on a
   tweetbotornot R package by Kearney. As the results show, pro-Russian
   positive media have a statistically significant higher probability for
   bot account activity than media expressing neutral opinions.},

Abstract = {Within the scholarship on the causes of civil wars, GDP per capita
   represents a strong and robust variable. Less attention, however, is
   paid to the role of economic decline. When it is included at all,
   scholars tend to consider it only in the period just prior to the onset
   of war. This paper argues that the impact of economic decline has been
   underestimated, for in addition to its short-term effects, evidence from
   case studies reveals that a particular pattern is often evident during
   periods of sharp economic decline, in which ethnonationalist actors
   ascend in political power while scapegoating minority populations. The
   resulting increase in interethnic tensions raises the risk of
   large-scale civil violence even many years after a major recession. The
   cases of Yugoslavia, Ivory Coast and India show the long-term effects of
   a common exogenous shock- the global recession of the late 1970s- in the
   form of rising ethnonationalist political actors, setting the stage for
   large-scale interethnic civil violence long after the initial economic
   shock.},

Abstract = {The European Commission in its 2015 study on the perceptions of the EU
   acknowledged that mutual perceptions held by actors in the international
   arena affect their expectations about the other's behaviour and hereby
   guide the interpretation of the other's actions. Knowledge of how and
   what image of the MENA countries and of the EU is conveyed by country
   delegations is important for understanding whether the information that
   influences EU foreign policy-making is representative, and of whom. EU
   delegations are an acknowledged source of knowledge that feed into EU
   policymaking, and proposals have even been made for strengthening their
   role. Based on interviews with heads of delegations/Ambassadors in 2021,
   four interlinked categories of concerns affecting the perceptions of the
   EU are identified: historical legacy; knowledge about and expectations
   towards the Union; competing values and aims; and the EU's internal
   policy inconsistencies. The findings in the interviews are
   contextualized through an analysis of previous research on the
   perceptions of the EU. Further, the article discusses the role of
   delegations in EU policy-making and invites to take a critical view of
   Ambassadors ` `perceptions of the perceptions of the EU'.},

Abstract = {Building and strengthening the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS)
   workforce in counterterrorism operations starts with effectively trained
   and educated intelligence analysts. However, identifying and
   establishing standards for effective training and core competencies for
   intelligence analysts can be a challenge. By drawing on ethnographic
   interviews with members of the Intelligence Community (IC) and
   conducting domain analysis, this article sets out to understand those
   challenges and examine what is required to solve them. More
   specifically, we sought to identify benchmarks for core competencies
   associated with intelligence analysis as well as gaps in standardisation
   and the current implementation of intelligence training and education.
   Based on our findings, we recommend a conceptual framework for homeland
   security intelligence training and education and chart a path to build a
   more innovative and efficient intelligence workforce able to conduct
   analysis and develop intelligence products that contribute to the
   missions of DHS.},

Abstract = {Creativity, specifically creative problem solving, is often excluded
   from Homeland Security Enterprise efforts to train and develop their
   workforces. To determine if this lack of training was a key knowledge
   gap in the communities, we drew on organisational creativity literature.
   Using the personnel databases O{*}NET and Careers in the Military
   Database, we conducted a training needs assessment by identifying
   relevant job tasks, knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA) that align
   with the creative process. More specifically, we sought to identify the
   need for creative problem-solving training and designated creative
   thinking time (e.g. red teaming) to influence innovative intelligence
   capabilities. Based on our findings, we recommend creativity training to
   facilitate creative thinking and action. Moreover, we outline
   situational and individual factors that will affect the transfer of the
   training, such as organisation environment, leadership, and creative
   self-efficacy. The impact of these recommendations will aid security,
   counterterrorism, and intelligence communities to efficiently detect and
   prevent emerging threats, as well as develop intelligence products to
   further support the Homeland Security Enterprise mission.},

Abstract = {Green bonds have become a key instrument for combating the climate
   crisis. To mitigate the risk of greenwashing, nongovernmental
   organizations and market participants have established transnational
   standards and certification schemes for the global governance of green
   bonds. This research aims to explain the variation in the adoption of
   certifica- tion across bonds and countries. By analyzing a data set of
   4,682 green bonds from fi fty- fi ve countries between 2016 and 2020,
   the multilevel mixed-effects models indicate that an increase in
   participants in the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures
   within a country positively correlates with the likelihood of domestic
   green bond issuers adopting the certification from the Climate Bonds
   Initiative (CBI). In countries with stronger state capacity to adopt
   climate laws and policies, green bond issuers are more likely to
   participate in the CBI certification. This study has implications for
   addressing the issue of greenwashing in the development of the green
   bond market.},

Title = {Ideological backtracking in ethnic parties: The case of the Swedish
   People's Party of Finland},
Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 19},
Abstract = {Scholars have examined the effects of mainstreaming on ethnic parties in
   various geopolitical contexts throughout Europe. These ethnic parties
   consistently promote socially liberal policies, constrain `illiberal'
   actors and prevent democratic backsliding. However, the mainstreaming of
   right-wing populist (or far-right) parties in Europe is causing
   mainstream ethnic parties to change their behaviours in some unexplored
   ways, too. In this analysis, we argue that right-wing populists can
   cause ethnic parties to experience political relapse-that is, to
   backtrack on non-ethnic ideological issues, thereby appearing to
   compromise on socially liberal policies. Political relapse occurs when
   ethnic and right-wing populist parties must work together (such as in
   coalition governments). While political relapse can polarize and
   fragment ethnic parties, it also yields some strategic upshots-namely,
   by appealing to more conservative and disaffected voters. Based on the
   Swedish People's Party of Finland, this analysis explores the aftermath
   of the political relapse, which occurred as a result of the leadership's
   decision to form a coalition government with Finland's influential
   right-wing party, the Finns Party, in 2023.},

Abstract = {The article analyses an original database of 177 Latin American women
   activists killed that had some connection with feminist social movements
   from 2015 to 2023. A growing body of literature has focused on the
   killings of socio-environmental activists in Latin America and where
   they occurred. However, their activisms are under-researched, precisely
   because feminist social movements and activists have frequently been
   killed while advocating for women's rights in the subcontinent. This
   article focuses on the circumstances, a few reasons portrayed in
   newspaper events, and the perpetrators of such violence. Based on a
   literature review, I argue that taking into account the recent
   narcodynamics of the region, it is possible to understand such violence
   within the context of drug-related violence, but also-and more likely-to
   consider those killings as political feminicides. Political feminicides
   are then examined largely through transfeminicides and
   peasant/communitarian activists.},

Title = {Development Pathways and the Political Economy of Maladaptation: The
   Case of Bioenergy as a Climate Strategy in Brazil},
Journal = {STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 17},
Abstract = {Although it is well known that large-scale bioenergy expansion erodes
   different environmental, social, and economic dimensions of sustainable
   development, in countries like Brazil, bioenergy is institutionalized as
   a flagship climate strategy aimed to cut down CO2 emissions in
   transport. These trade-offs have serious implications for climate change
   governance and sustainable development; however, conventional approaches
   have not yet properly explained this seeming paradox. This article
   addresses this gap from a critical development pathways approach to
   bioenergy as a maladaptive strategy in Brazil. I propose an analytical
   framework to observe how different ideas, interests, and institutions
   interplay in the historical institutionalization of bioenergy as a
   climate strategy. The analysis shows that bioenergy institutionalization
   has been driven by the endemic economic crisis in the sugar sector and
   governmental interests associated with security and developmental
   imperatives. The unsustainable co-evolution of development pathways and
   bioenergy, marked by deforestation, land colonization, and agricultural
   expansion, has narrowed the adaptation space in agriculture, gearing
   current climate policy towards path-dependent maladaptive strategies
   like bioenergy. Paradoxically, framing bioenergy as a climate strategy
   has been useful to justify more expansive policies in favor of the
   sugarcane industry, and to greenwash the Brazilian climate policy in the
   international arena of climate governance.},

Abstract = {Post-election audits are thought to bolster voter confidence in
   elections, but it is unclear which aspects of audits drive public trust.
   Using preregistered vignette and conjoint survey experiments
   administered by YouGov on a sample of 2,000 American respondents, we
   find that how an audit is conducted is more important than what an audit
   finds. Structural features of audits, like who conducts it and how its
   results are announced, turn out to be more consequential to voter
   evaluations of election results than the actual discrepancy found.
   Moreover, while Democrats and Republicans have increasingly divided
   views of the state of democracy in the United States, they are similarly
   receptive to information presented about audits and largely agree that
   audits are effective tools for detecting errors in vote counting. Our
   findings thus reinforce the expectation that audits do increase voter
   trust and highlight that election administrators can strengthen voter
   confidence by making audits as transparent as possible.},

   formal policy- and decision-making modes within the CFSP/CSDP have
   changed little during the past 25 years, the EU's international identity
   did still change over time, potentially indicating a ``coming of
   age{''}. How can we explain this maturation of the EU's foreign and
   security identity despite the critique of the EU's inefficiency and lack
   of adequateness in security policy? By means of re-interpreting existing
   scholarship, we argue that the relative maturation of the EU's foreign
   and security identity since the Lisbon Treaty is not so much linked to
   formal institutional change ({''}maturation by design{''}), but rather
   to changing informal institutional practice and the selection and use of
   respective instruments ({''}maturation by practice{''}). This dynamic,
   we argue, is due to an interplay of internal and external factors,
   accompanied by ongoing socialisation of member states in how they
   perceive the nature of the CFSP/CSDP and the EU as an international
   foreign and security actor.},

Abstract = {Almost 30 years since the Maastricht Treaty provided an explicit legal
   basis in the health realm, the European Union (EU) declared global
   health an ``essential pillar{''} of its external action. Yet, it is
   still seeking to ``come of age{''} as a global health actor. This might
   be facilitated by the securitisation of health, which was evident during
   the COVID-19 crisis, often framed as a war against a common enemy.
   However, the literature is yet to establish whether these analogies were
   systematically embraced by EU institutions, signalling a Zeitenwende -
   or ``epochal tectonic shift{''} - in the EU's health-related discourse.
   Through an analysis of key strategic documents and public statements,
   this article determines the extent to which COVID-19 drove the attempted
   securitisation of global health in the EU. Relatedly, it discusses
   whether this framing might be conducive to an enhanced EU actorness on
   the world stage. The article concludes that, after COVID-19 struck, some
   EU institutions did intensify their ``health security{''} rhetoric in
   pursuit of an expanded, more ``mature{''} role. While this shift was
   neither widespread nor enduring enough to be characterised as
   ``epochal{''}, it does denote the EU's turn towards a less altruistic
   conception of its global health action.},

Abstract = {Italy plays a performative role in constructing the (Southern) border of
   the European Union (EU). The actions of Italy affect and are
   simultaneously affected by the European border and its connotation.
   Offering an original contribution from International Relations theory,
   this article looks at how ontological (in)security affects bordering
   dynamics in a context of recurrent co-constitution between the European
   Union and the state. Italy is analyzed in this article by looking at the
   main securitizing narratives, their legitimizing arguments, and matching
   bordering practices considered adaptive strategies. Methodologically,
   this article uses primary and secondary sources to retrieve
   securitization instances throughout three different administrations
   running the country from 2016 to 2020. It is argued that three bordering
   exercises have repeatedly surfaced: the definition of Italy's external
   borders as equivalent to those of the Union; the expansion of the
   borders of the EU toward southern Libya; and the demarcation of the
   borders of its national community through the allowance and/or denial of
   rights to immigrants already in Italy. They all come imbued with
   critical consequences for Italy and the EU, which are examined in this
   work.},

Abstract = {Two decades after the 2004 enlargement of the European Union, the three
   small nations of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have emerged as a
   steadfast and resilient Baltic political, cultural, and geographic
   region. Influenced by the political and economic liberalization of the
   early 1990s, the small nations have undergone significant systemic
   re-structuring and transformations, accompanied by socio-cultural
   volatility and contemporary vulnerabilities such as escalating
   inequalities, signs of populism and polarization, and indications of
   social discontent standing out amongst the most emblematic ones.
   Adopting a `process-focused' approach, this paper aims to depict how
   democratic institutions in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, with a
   specific emphasis on conventional news media, aspire to uphold
   distinctive characteristics of a shared democratic culture amidst
   intensified information disruptions, including the surge of online
   disinformation, information manipulations and a decline in institutional
   trust. It presents evidence based on the two pillars of what is referred
   to as the so-called `Baltic resilience': the media's institutional
   position and the agentive aspect, which refers to the public's
   self-efficacy and perceptions, emergent to counter manifold
   `inforuptions' in the Baltic region.},

Abstract = {Like much of the rest of the world, East Asia (Northeast and Southeast
   Asia) has recently experienced a democratic ``fall{''} in which several
   electoral democracies have undergone autocratization. This synchronized
   with China's rise through what can be called illiberal realignment as
   autocratizing regimes in the region have sought increasing material and
   ideological support from Beijing in the face of Western human rights
   criticism and occasional (although usually only the threat of)
   sanctions. China has viewed this regress as a rejection of
   ``Western-style democracy.{''} Yet a democratic ``spring{''} which
   preceded the fall left a legacy of democratic normativity in the region
   as backsliding regimes continued to seek legitimacy through (however
   unfair and unfree) elections and (partial) liberalization. Residual
   democratic normativity combined with geopolitical insecurities have
   limited the region's illiberal realignment toward China during this
   democratic fall.},

Abstract = {Between 1972 and 1986, Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines headed an
   autocratic system that allowed him to rule with little to no
   accountability. Some 36 years after FM (as he is popularly called) and
   family were driven from power into exile in Hawaii, his son, Ferdinand
   `Bongbong' Marcos, Jr., was overwhelmingly elected President in the May
   2022 general elections. This turnaround seemed puzzling to many, but
   others saw a long-term deliberate process of rehabilitation after the
   family returned to the Philippines. Our paper explores how Filipinos
   remembered FM in the years after his ouster. What drives the memory of
   dictatorship in the Philippines? Using time series data on public
   opinion about FM post-ouster, we find that a generally positive
   appreciation of Marcos as former president had crystallised early on
   across nearly all the major variables of age, sex, education, location
   and ethnicity.},

Abstract = {EU attitudes are multidimensional and likely to matter differentially
   for voting across different parties. The 2019 European Parliament (EP)
   elections offer a unique setting for testing the differential effects of
   multidimensional EU attitudes, as the election results entailed
   increased political fragmentation - with notable pro- and anti-EU party
   groups in the EP gaining strength. This article examines the importance
   of EU attitudes on electoral choice and zooms in on the influence of
   specific EU attitudes on party voting in EP elections ('EU issue
   voting'). We use original survey data collected around the 2019 EP
   elections in ten EU member states, which include a fine-grained
   measurement of EU attitudes. We find evidence for EU issue voting in all
   countries, albeit not equally structured across countries. EU issue
   voting matters across all party groups with affective and performance
   evaluations having the strongest effects.},

Abstract = {Driven by the motivation to raise the ambition level of climate action
   and to foster the transformation of economies, current climate policy
   discourse revolves around ways to improve cooperation between
   industrialized countries and emerging economies. We identify three broad
   types of initiatives-multilateral-cross sectoral, multilateral, sector
   specific, and climate and development partnerships-and assess them for
   potentials to deliver on such objectives with a specific focus on
   industry transformation. This paper provides new reflections on the
   institutionalization of international climate cooperation. Specifically,
   we demonstrate the urgent need to understand what values, norms, and
   underlying principles drive a cooperation in order to draw conclusions
   on how to best institutionalize climate cooperation rules.in-use. We
   conclude that an overemphasis on a CO2 price and on carbon border
   adjustment mechanisms, such as in the context of the initial proposals
   for a cross-sectoral climate club envisaged by G7 countries, would have
   contributed to a further polarization of the international landscape. We
   find, however, that multilateral, sectoral alliances play an important
   role for international goal setting and the convergence on standards,
   metrics, and benchmarks. Based on our analysis, we recommend
   strengthening multilateral, sector-specific partnerships. These can be
   focused on sectoral topics as a connector between countries, allowing
   for a strategically-aligned, increasingly deep collaboration. However,
   for any initiative to succeed, processes of international
   institutionalization will be needed in order to agree on rules for
   implementation based on aligned interests and equity. Building such
   institutions may well serve as a steppingstone toward more durable
   cooperation structures between developed economies and emerging
   economies. In sum, no existing cooperation approach is perfect, but
   three actions may be taken to move the agenda forward: First, reform of
   the carbon border adjustment mechanism and removing it from the center
   of climate club discussions, second, coupling sectoral alliances with
   climate and development partnerships, and three, designing them in a way
   to address fears of political influence seeking and superimposition of
   global north agendas on the global south.},

Abstract = {Brazil, for many scholars and pundits, showcased the risk of democratic
   breakdown with the election of a far-right populist like Jair Bolsonaro.
   Against pessimistic expectations, however, not only has Brazilian
   democracy survived but politics has returned to business as usual. What
   can explain this supposedly unanticipated outcome? This article provides
   an analytical assessment of this this puzzle and offers an alternative
   explanation. We argue that both the diagnoses of Brazilian institutions
   and the predictions made were misguided. We explore the role played by
   the Supreme Court, party system, media, and congressional politics in
   restricting Bolsonaro's illiberal initiatives.},

   States, Spain, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and the United Kingdom, have
   witnessed massive protest movements over the past decade. Numerous
   recent studies have underscored the pivotal role of the interaction
   between protest movements and party politics. However, our understanding
   of why certain movements profoundly impact the political landscape,
   sometimes triggering the collapse of existing party systems, while
   others barely alter conventional politics, remains limited. Drawing from
   case studies of Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Turkey, we conduct a
   systematic comparative analysis of the impact of protest movements
   during the 2010s. We aim to elucidate why and how some protests have
   proven more effective in reshaping party politics, while others have
   faltered. Our contention is that the dynamics of the party system play a
   pivotal role in determining the capacity of social movements to
   instigate transformative changes in party politics.},

Abstract = {Does the perception of sharing values strengthen the EU citizens' sense
   of belonging to the European Union? The present study uses the concept
   of social identity derived from social psychology to explore this
   question. It assumes that the perception that EU citizens share the same
   value orientations with each other strengthens identification with the
   EU's political community. To empirically test this thesis, two-level
   regression models are conducted on the basis of survey data from the
   2019 Eurobarometer (EB 92.3). The empirical results show that the
   subjective perception of being similar in terms of value orientations is
   positively associated with EU identity.},

Abstract = {Even amid the unprecedented public health challenges attributable to the
   COVID-19 pandemic, opposition to vaccinating against the novel
   coronavirus has been both prevalent and politically contentious in
   American public life. In this paper, we theorize that attitudes toward
   COVID-19 vaccination might ``spill over{''} to shape attitudes toward
   ``postpandemic{''} vaccination programs and policy mandates for years to
   come. We find this to be the case using evidence from a large, original
   panel study, as well as two observational surveys, conducted on American
   adults during the pandemic. Specifically, we observe evidence of
   COVID-19 vaccine spillover onto general vaccine skepticism, flu shot
   intention, and attitudes toward hypothetical vaccines (i.e., vaccines in
   development), which do not have preexisting attitudinal connotations.
   Further, these spillover effects vary by partisanship and COVID-19
   vaccination status, with the political left and those who received two
   or more COVID-19 vaccine doses becoming more provaccine, while the
   political right and the unvaccinated became more anti-vaccine. Taken
   together, these results point to the salience and politicization of the
   COVID-19 vaccine impacting non-COVID vaccine attitudes. We end by
   discussing the implications of this study for effective health
   messaging.},

Abstract = {This brief report reviews some recent research on the politics of sea
   migration at the Southern European border, and in particular Italy, with
   two primary objectives. First, I seek to briefly illustrate how public
   attitudes towards migrants at sea in this region are neither monolithic
   nor unconditionally concentrated in certain areas; rather, public
   reactions correspond to a combination of emotional and utilitarian
   considerations that exist across many receiving communities and make
   public opinion sensitive to migrants' life experiences. Second, I note
   the implications of sea migration events and their associated public
   reactions for policy and agenda setting. I hereby discuss how public
   opinion activation is fundamental for policy reactions, and why
   institutional responsiveness has been disrupted and limited.},

Abstract = {This paper probes the relationship between nationalism and belonging. In
   the context of the enactment of the `Nation-State Law' in Israel, it
   addresses a twofold question: how do members of the Druze community
   articulate the minority group's sense of belonging to the national
   community, and what do their constructions of belonging suggest about
   how Druze might shape and secure their belonging in the Jewish
   nationalist project? Our analytical approach draws on theoretical
   accounts of the politics of belonging and nationalist projects centred
   on culture and political values; civic identifications and attachments;
   and the racialized positioning of social groups. The analysis of 18
   semi-structured interviews evoked four metaphors through which we
   elaborate the impact of the Nation-State Law on Druze belonging and
   explore the implications for Druze engagement with this Jewish
   nationalist project. We envision the possibility of Druze pursuing a
   transversal intersectional political project of belonging as non-Jews in
   Israel.},

   Syria},

Abstract = {Captagon is an illegal amphetamine that is widely used in the Middle
   East. Since the civil war started in 2011, Syria has become an
   international hub for Captagon production. A main Captagon trafficking
   route runs from Syria to the Arabian peninsula via Jordan. This has
   caused increasing domestic consumption of Captagon in Jordan. This
   article asks how Captagon trafficking and use in Jordan intersects with
   war in Syria and its wider impact. It illustrates how drug trafficking
   can be the product of violence and can also become a conduit for further
   violence. The article firstly analyses the drugs-conflict nexus in Syria
   and emphasizes Captagon trafficking as a new case study to this
   literature. It unpacks the role of the state in the crime-conflict
   nexus. The second half of the article draws on critical border studies
   literature to illustrate how the illegal Captagon trade has increased
   violence by contributing to an increasingly militarized border, with
   significant consequences for the communities who live and work there.
   The study concludes by considering the implications of Captagon
   trafficking for peace and stability in Syria and the region.},

Title = {Lithium's Northern Buzz: Extractivism, Energy Transitions, and Resource
   Frontiers in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Québec},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {61-82},
Abstract = {In the ``buzz{''} before extraction begins in earnest, landscapes,
   financial interests, and communities are reshaped in anticipation of
   economic windfalls-even if a project never materializes. The buzz around
   critical minerals necessary for decarbonization technologies adds the
   existential threat of the climate crisis to the financial, social, and
   political pressures that normally drive resource extraction. As this
   article illustrates in its study of the emerging lithium frontier in
   Abitibi-T \& eacute;miscamingue, Qu \& eacute;bec, these processes are
   always overdetermined, blurring simple causal explanations-particularly
   in the early and sustaining ``buzz{''} of extraction. Drawing from
   interviews with frontline communities and decision makers, I aim here to
   assess the relationship between extraction and energy transitions at
   emerging energy frontiers of the Global North. Path dependency,
   geopolitics, and local dynamics all inform the (re)formation of resource
   frontiers and, in the process, offer new ways to consider the politics
   of extraction and energy transitions in the context of intensifying
   climate crises.},

Abstract = {Previous studies demonstrate that politicians' issue positions and
   rhetorical style have grown increasingly extreme. It remains unclear,
   however, whether extremity pays off electorally. Using two preregistered
   conjoint experiments conducted in the United States (N=2,006) and Israel
   (N=1,999), we investigate whether citizens reward or penalize candidates
   for taking extreme positions (i.e., proposing radical solutions to
   societal problems) and using an extreme rhetorical style (i.e.,
   communicating in a way that signals rigidity and dogmatism). The results
   are consistent in showing that extremity is costly for candidates.
   Across countries, citizens penalize both in-party and out-party
   candidates for both extreme positions and an extreme rhetorical style,
   and the average penalty for being extreme is a 16-percentage-point
   decrease in candidate support. Our results are in line with scholarship
   demonstrating that citizens disapprove of elite extremity. They also
   indicate that citizens react independently to elites' substantive policy
   positions and their communication style.},

Abstract = {This article explores the social mechanisms that facilitate the
   transformation of micro-level bonds into coherent nationalist narratives
   of solidarity. The aim is to explain the paradox: while the armed forces
   are highly nationalist institutions, most ordinary combatants detest
   nationalist rhetoric on the battlefield. Drawing on the interviews with
   the combatants who fought in the 1991-1995 wars in Croatia and Bosnia
   and Herzegovina together with the analysis of the mass media reports, I
   examine how deep bonds of micro-solidarity forged in the violent
   experiences are transformed into coherent nationalist discourses. I
   explore how social ties generated in the protracted face-to-face
   interactions can be enveloped by the specific social organisations and
   then `translated' into nationalist ideologies that project deep
   comradeship as `national solidarities'. I aim to show that the direct
   war experience does not automatically generate strong bonds of national
   solidarity. Instead, nationalism is always a product of protracted
   coercive-organisational, ideological and micro-interactional work.},

Title = {Post-Salafism in Cambodia: From counterreligion to accommodation},
Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 6},
Abstract = {Over the last decade, Salafism among Cambodia's Muslim minority has
   undergone substantial transformation. Initially, it functioned as a
   counterreligion, with participants claiming to hold the absolute truth
   and aiming to purify `corrupted' Muslim practices like celebrating the
   Prophet's birthday, following the shafi'ilegal school, and engaging in
   rituals influenced by Cham, Malay, and Khmer traditions. Recently, young
   Salafis have revised their attitudes, seeking cooperation and
   understanding with their main competitors, the shafi'is and the Jama'at
   al-Tabligh movement. The article explores the factors that triggered
   these developments and examines how they are unfolding in the
   sociopolitical context of Cambodia's Muslim minority. The article delves
   into the establishment of Salafism in Cambodia and analyses the
   contributing factors to its remarkable success among the country's
   Muslim minority. Then, it explores the emergence of post-Salafism
   through a process of indigenization by presenting two ethnographic case
   studies. The first investigates aspirations of the young Muslim middle
   class and the influence of post-Salafi trends from South Thailand and
   Malaysia. The second examines how post-Salafism reinterprets young
   Muslims' sense of belonging to Cambodia and their relationship with
   national symbols. The article chiefly relies on semi-structured
   interviews with dozens of young Cambodian Muslims conducted between 2019
   and 2023.},

Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},

Month = {2024 SEP 30},
Abstract = {We develop a new class of spatial voting models for binary preference
   data that can accommodate both monotonic and non-monotonic response
   functions, and are more flexible than alternative ``unfolding{''} models
   previously introduced in the literature. We then use these models to
   estimate revealed preferences for legislators in the U.S. House of
   Representatives and justices on the U.S. Supreme Court. The results from
   these applications indicate that the new models provide superior
   complexity-adjusted performance to various alternatives and that the
   additional flexibility leads to preferences' estimates that more closely
   match the perceived ideological positions of legislators and justices.},

Abstract = {This research article analyses the conditionality related to conflicts
   in the Western Balkans. It examines the qualitative nature of conflict
   conditionality and its evolution in three different stages of
   contractual relations between the EC/EU and the Western Balkan states.
   Utilising a six-dimensional comparative framework in a longitudinal case
   study design, the study reveals that conflict conditionality comprises
   two different categories: reactive and preventive. These two groups
   differ primarily in their purposes, but also in their qualitative nature
   and evolution. The findings also indicate that the EU still lacks the
   resolve to settle conflicts between non-member neighbouring countries.
   However, this approach bears the risk of further slowing the Western
   Balkans' EU integration.},

Abstract = {The implementation of EU law has been investigated since the 1980s
   without pinpointing any general explanatory mechanisms, while most
   studies focus on highly specific empirical analysis without going beyond
   basic conceptual descriptions. Theoretically, this paper proposes an
   alternative comparative framework to conceptualize and analyze
   differentiated policy implementation based on concept structural
   considerations. Empirically, existing case studies are compared in a
   meta-study by transferring their statements on explanatory conditions
   and outcomes into a parsimonious, procedural model. This approach
   enables a theory-guided, systematic comparison of qualitative case
   studies which has long been considered a desideratum in the
   implementation literature. The paper addresses the question under which
   conditions correct implementation (i.e. transposition and application)
   of EU directives occurs. Starting from a literature assessment,
   explanatory patterns are extracted and formalized as set-theoretic
   conditions connected to transposition and application as outcomes. The
   resulting concept structural model links the conceptual and explanatory
   levels of the underlying concepts. Using fuzzy set QCA, cases from
   environmental and social policy directives are assessed empirically
   based on case study data. The results largely confirm the expectation
   that only a conjunction of willingness- and ability-related conditions
   leads to correct implementation, particularly conjunctions of favourable
   attitudes and compatible institutional structures or capacities.},

Abstract = {Nation branding as a concept and practice of highlighting the country's
   most important performance indicators has been important for the state's
   conduct in the last 30 years. Although not fully grounded within
   existing theories, its association with neoliberal state conduct
   explains its application in the post-socialist countries of Central and
   Eastern Europe. Slovakia, as an example of a new, small, and
   post-socialist country, has been trying to impact its visibility by
   means of nation branding. Key to it were the motivations and milestones
   of European Union accession and the presidency of the Council of the
   European Union. Despite these significant events, the management and
   content development of the Slovak brand stands as a particularistic
   example with creative ideas but lack of brand continuity. Explored by a
   qualitative approach demonstrating nation branding as a process, of
   process-tracing and content analysis, this paper follows the trajectory
   of nation branding in the Slovak sovereign statehood with an emphasis on
   the European Union. The analysis confirms the particular standing of the
   Slovak brand.},

Abstract = {While it is often assumed that the core debates about nationalism were
   settled by modernist scholars already in the 1980s, there are reasons to
   question this theoretical `consensus', especially because it fails to
   anticipate the wave of nationalist geopolitics that is currently
   sweeping through the world. Contemporary studies of nationalism
   typically refrain from conceptualising politics in spatial terms, while
   overstating states' ability to shape ethno-national identities
   irrespective of their ethnic roots and offering little empirical
   validation. To overcome these limitations, it is useful to analyse how
   nationalism transforms the state, rather than the reverse. This article
   reports findings from an EU-funded research project that uses historical
   maps covering borders of states and ethnic groups to show how
   nationalism causes increasing congruence between these borders and how a
   lack thereof makes conflict and border change more likely. This risk is
   further increased by `restorative' narratives bemoaning supposedly lost
   independence and unity. Further research traces the spread of reactive
   nationalism through modernisation processes driven by railroad expansion
   until the early 20th century. Yet this does not mean that state
   partition offers the only, or the best, solution to nationality
   problems. Power sharing can pacify at least as well as ethno-nationalist
   border change.},

Abstract = {This study aims to contribute to advancing the understanding of
   entrepreneurial ecosystems, Latin American development, and the
   evolution and future perspectives of the Middle East. It used a
   cross-sectional research design and quantitative data with 750
   observations from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, specifically the
   National Experts Survey and the Adult Population Survey. The results
   were analyzed by the Partial Least Squares Technique (PLS-SEM) by
   grouping countries into two balanced samples of underexplored regions:
   the Middle East and Latin America. The two regions, Latin America and
   the Middle East, have diverse entrepreneurial ecosystems; each condition
   impacts entrepreneurial activities in different ways. In Latin America,
   the most significant variable is ``Physical Infrastructure{''}, while in
   the Middle East, the most significant determinants are ``Commercial and
   Professional Infrastructure{''} and ``Entrepreneurship Culture{''}. This
   study shows that to support entrepreneurial activities, each region
   requires different settings for their entrepreneurial ecosystems. It
   contributes to the literature on regional entrepreneurial ecosystems and
   to less explored regions to advance our understanding, which will drive
   better policies and actions.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the Czech Republic's evolving understanding of its
   Europeanness and its position within the European Union (EU) during its
   first two decades of membership. The study focuses on the country's two
   EU Council Presidencies in 2009 and 2022 as significant platforms for
   renegotiating its European identity and engaging with questions of the
   country's role and vision within the EU. Despite the Czech Republic's
   continued ambiguity towards European integration, we observe a
   surprising discursive shift between the two Presidencies; from a
   reluctant to a model European. Primarily driven by the political
   leadership rather than the lived experiences of EU membership among the
   Czech population, this shift testifies to the influence of the EU
   Council Presidency as an institution in shaping member states' positions
   and the difficulty of deviating from the broader course of European
   integration.},

Abstract = {This study examines the evolution of ethnic symbol consumption in the
   Basque Country following the end of ETA's violent activities in 2011. It
   delves into the shifting political and cultural context of the Basque
   provinces during this period, underscoring the impact that terrorism and
   its cessation have had on creating distinct patterns of cultural
   consumption. The focus then turns towards the case of the `Hand of
   Irulegi', an Iron Age relic discovered in 2022 that allegedly contains
   the oldest inscription in an ancestor of Euskera-the Basque language.
   The paper argues that the rapid adoption of the Hand of Irulegi by
   Basque society as an ethnic symbol is directly related to
   transformations in the conception of Basque identity in the aftermath of
   ETA's dissolution. These transformations include, mainly, the
   intentional forgetting of recent historical events by a large segment of
   Basque citizens and the emergence of Euskera as the main fulcrum of
   contemporary Basque cultural identity. The Hand, due to its
   chronological remoteness and its exclusive association with the Basque
   language, seems to be custom-made to serve as a symbol for this new type
   of identification.},

Abstract = {Conjoint analysis is a popular experimental design used to measure
   multidimensional preferences. Many researchers focus on estimating the
   average marginal effects of each factor while averaging over the other
   factors. Although this allows for straightforward design-based
   estimation, the results critically depend on the ways in which factors
   interact with one another. An alternative model-based approach can
   compute various quantities of interest, but requires correct model
   specifications, a challenging task for conjoint analysis with many
   factors. We propose a new hypothesis testing approach based on the
   conditional randomization test (CRT) to answer the most fundamental
   question of conjoint analysis: Does a factor of interest matter in any
   way given the other factors? Although it only provides a formal test of
   these binary questions, the CRT is solely based on the randomization of
   factors, and hence requires no modeling assumption. This means that the
   CRT can provide a powerful and assumption-free statistical test by
   enabling the use of any test statistic, including those based on complex
   machine learning algorithms. We also show how to test commonly used
   regularity assumptions. Finally, we apply the proposed methodology to
   conjoint analysis of immigration preferences. An open-source software
   package is available for implementing the proposed methodology. The
   proposed methodology is implemented via an open-source software R
   package CRTConjoint, available through the Comprehensive R Archive
   Network https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CRTConjoint/index.html.},

Title = {Making a Difference: The Consequences of Electoral Experiments},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 8},
Abstract = {While experiments on elections represent a popular tool in social
   science, the possibility that experimental interventions could affect
   who wins office remains a central ethical concern. I formally
   characterize electoral experimental designs to derive an upper bound on
   aggregate electoral impact under different assumptions about
   interference. I then introduce a decision rule based on comparison of
   this bound to predicted election outcomes to determine whether an
   experiment should be implemented. Researchers can mitigate the
   possibility of affecting aggregate outcomes by reducing the saturation
   of treatment or focusing experiments in districts and electoral systems
   where treated voters are less likely to be pivotal. These conditions
   identify novel trade-offs between adhering to ethical commitments and
   the statistical power and external validity of electoral experiments.
   More broadly, this paper shows that the formalization of an ethical
   objective facilitates a closer mapping between ethical considerations
   and experimental design than is currently practiced.},

Abstract = {The events of 7 October, spurred by Hamas' `Al-Aqsa Flood' operation and
   Israel's subsequent fierce military retaliation on Gaza, reverberated
   throughout Shi'a Islamist communities with ties to the Iran-led Axis of
   Resistance. This article aims to delve into the responses of various
   Iraqi Shi'a Islamist factions to the unfolding conflict, shedding light
   on their stances towards Israel and its Western allies, shaped by
   intricate domestic and transnational considerations aimed at bolstering
   their legitimacy and influence. To grasp the nuanced array of reactions,
   I provide a brief overview of the main Shi'a Islamist actors involved in
   resistance politics in Iraq, examining their embeddedness within the
   state apparatus and their relationships with both regional and global
   actors. Subsequently, this discussion will explore how their strategy
   reflects not only their ideological underpinnings but also their
   long-standing interests predating the events of 7 October.},

   National Congress},
Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 10},
Abstract = {Perhaps more than any other organisation, the African National Congress
   (ANC) has defined who belongs in South Africa. Yet, how does the
   organisation imagine national belonging, and how has this developed? We
   explore these questions through a discourse analysis of the
   organisation's annual `January 8' statements. First, the ANC has
   historically embraced a `tapestry nationalist' approach to belonging,
   which rejects majority-minority distinctions in favour of a single
   people and celebrates cultural diversity without reifying groups into
   distinct political constituencies. Second, while the ANC framed `the
   people' as a militant democratic mass during the anti-apartheid
   struggle, from the 1990s the organisation reimagined `the people'
   primarily as economic subjects in need of services. Third, the avoidance
   of majority-minority distinctions is increasingly challenged by the
   political salience of racial inequalities in land ownership, to which
   the ANC has struggled to respond. The ANC's approach challenges common
   accounts of nationalism, such as liberal nationalism, multicultural
   nationalism, and post-nationalism.},

   Authoritarian Rule},

Abstract = {From ceremonial spectacles to repressive laws, the Thai state has
   strategically utilized fear to assert its control over the populace and
   legitimize the ruling classes. Through the efforts of the monarchy,
   military and other influential forces, a climate of fear has been
   cultivated and disseminated to maintain the status quo. In Thai
   politics, fear is not just a byproduct of authoritarian rule, but rather
   a conscious and calculated tactic employed by those in power. This
   article examines the ways in which fear is created, perpetuated and
   upheld through both legal and cultural means, starting with King
   Bhumibol Adulyadej and continuing with King Vajiralongkorn. Drawing upon
   the concepts of cultural hegemony by Gramsci and the concept of the
   ``theatre state{''} by Geertz, it sheds light on the utilization of fear
   as a means of exerting power in Thai society, reinforcing the monarchy's
   central role in maintaining political stability and social order.},

Abstract = {How do leaders respond to costly demands to re-nationalise political
   control? The re-shaping of state-society relations engendered by
   globalisation has produced a backlash in the form of populist demands to
   ``take back control{''}, yet leaders face significant costs in
   responding to demands to re-nationalise highly interdependent economies.
   In this article, we show how leaders respond to these demands by
   crafting new discourses of their polity's position in the international
   system, a process we term ``discursive externalisation{''}.
   Externalisation is a cheap way of responding to domestic pressures which
   avoids powerful domestic veto players while benefiting from the rallying
   effects of foreign policy renewal. By keeping rhetoric broad,
   externalisation can co-opt elements of the status quo in favour of new
   representations of state-society relations and a new basis for political
   legitimacy. We demonstrate our argument empirically by examining the
   articulation of new discourses in the foreign and security policy domain
   after the 2016 Brexit referendum in both the UK and the EU. We show how
   ideas of ``Global Britain{''} and ``European strategic autonomy{''} both
   helped to rearticulate the relationship between the polity and its
   citizens by externalising agendas for internal reform, transforming
   crises of legitimacy into discourses of international renewal.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the extent to which participating in
   Independence Day practices influences people's national identity while
   taking into consideration the differences between public top-down
   practices and private bottom-up habits. It is a longitudinal study that
   uses a four-wave panel survey to inspect levels of national identity
   across time as well as participation in various Independence Day
   practices over two successive years. There was an increase in the levels
   of some dimensions of national identity among those who participated in
   Independence Day practices - both top-down and bottom-up - while there
   were no changes in these levels among those who did not participate.},

Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 6},
Abstract = {Nationalism studies tend to focus on a relatively closed and abstract
   nation. This paper addresses these features by analysing the case of
   Girmitiya nationalism, a nationalism in the Indian diaspora that
   broadens the exclusive focus on the nation. It introduces the concept of
   lived culture that makes the nationalism of an ethnic diaspora community
   concrete and specifies the interaction between global forces and local
   life. Using data obtained as a member of the studied ethnic community
   and deploying additional concepts such as ethnogenesis, Creole hegemonic
   nationalism, ethnification, diaspora bonding and Girmitiya ideology, the
   paper demonstrates the usefulness of the concept of lived culture. The
   concept of lived culture thus discloses the specificities of Girmitiya
   nationalism, while countervailing the tendency to restrict the focus on
   the nation and offering a route to broaden the focus.},

Title = {Towards an exclusionary social contract: Narratives of a revanchist city
   in (post)war Syria},
Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 20},
Abstract = {This article asks to what extent national narratives drive changes in
   social contracts on both national and local level. Societal and
   especially state actors can use narratives to underline or omit specific
   rights and duties in social contracts, or to privilege particular
   contracting parties. In the Syrian case, repression and foreign
   intervention triggered changes in the national social contract, yet the
   exclusionary narrative functioned as a catalyst for these changes and
   entrenched them on both, the national and the city level. We show that
   housing, land and property (HLP) policies in (post-)war Damascus have an
   urban scope but a national impact. Not only wartime destruction but also
   post-war demolition have been particularly high in selected
   neighbourhoods and (re-)construction favoured upscale urban mega
   projects. This approach to urban planning reflects an exclusionary
   national narrative, which stigmatizes parts of the population as
   `terrorists' and suspects them of stirring up public disorder. In
   consequence, these groups are marginalized or even `evicted' from the
   social contract. For those Syrians still covered by the social contract,
   the narrative seeks to offer a justification for the large-scale
   exclusion of fellow citizens. Our analysis is based on an extensive
   review of literature from human geography, with a focus on the physical
   and social urban fabric, and political science, on intra-societal power
   relations.},

Title = {Three Republics of Armenia: The Soviet Past and the Politics of Memory
   in Post-Soviet Armenia (1991-2018)},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Deciding how to relate to the Soviet past is a key question in the
   politics of memory for the societies and political elites of the
   post-Soviet countries. Throughout the post-Soviet decades Armenian
   political and intellectual elites tried to form a complex attitude to
   the Soviet past, neither rejecting, nor appropriating the Soviet legacy
   completely, but assimilating it within the paradigm of national history.
   Within this paradigm Soviet Armenia is viewed as a stage in the
   development of Armenian nationhood, as ``the second republic{''}, which
   links the first ``attempt{''} at building a nation-state, ``the first
   republic{''} c{''} of 1918-1920, 920, to the ``3rd rd republic{''}, i.e.
   the post-Soviet state of Armenia. This paradigm, in which the Soviet
   past is neither completely rejected, or accepted, but certain elements
   of it are integrated into the national history narrative, is optimal for
   post-Soviet Armenia, given both the peculiarity of Armenia's a's
   historical experience (particularly the role played by Russia/USSR in
   the context of Armenian-Turkish relations), as well as the current
   geopolitical setting, in which Armenia and Russia are formal allies.
   This attitude, which can be described as ``mnemonic ambiguity{''},
   allows the assertion of an independent and sovereign Armenian state as
   legitimate, while at the same time avoiding a confrontation with an ally
   in the realm of memory politics.},

Title = {Who defines moderation? Adapting Islamist and Salafi identities in

Abstract = {The idea of Tunisian `moderation' as an essential constituent part of
   national identity has been historically used by autocratic governments
   as an instrument of securitization, investing the state with the unique
   authority to suppress movements - in practice, usually the Islamist
   opposition - deemed antithetical to this identity and thus threatening
   to the nation and its people. This paper explores how, after the Arab
   Uprisings in 2010-2011, diverse groups of Islamists responded to
   pre-existing discourses of Tunisian national identity as moderate. After
   the revolution, Tunisian Islamists and Salafis initially both contested
   the assumptions behind pre-revolutionary conceptualizations of national
   identity that had previously excluded them from the boundaries of
   normative citizenship by reframing the nature of the threat or
   attempting to redefine and expand the nature of moderation. Both groups
   encountered different outcomes in their attempts to recalibrate the
   notions of identity, religion and the state. These divergences can be
   traced to their differing ideologies, political situations and
   incentives. Nevertheless, the fact that each group engaged with - rather
   than dismissed - this discourse suggests the centrality of the
   state-moderation-security nexus in structuring past and present
   conceptualizations of Tunisian moderation.},

Title = {NonRandom Tweet Mortality and Data Access Restrictions: Compromising the
   Replication of Sensitive Twitter Studies},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 17},
Abstract = {Used by politicians, journalists, and citizens, Twitter has been the
   most important social media platform to investigate political phenomena
   such as hate speech, polarization, or terrorism for over a decade. A
   high proportion of Twitter studies of emotionally charged or
   controversial content limit their ability to replicate findings due to
   incomplete Twitter-related replication data and the inability to recrawl
   their datasets entirely. This paper shows that these Twitter studies and
   their findings are considerably affected by nonrandom tweet mortality
   and data access restrictions imposed by the platform. While sensitive
   datasets suffer a notably higher removal rate than nonsensitive
   datasets, attempting to replicate key findings of Kim's (2023, Political
   Science Research and Methods 11, 673-695) influential study on the
   content of violent tweets leads to significantly different results. The
   results highlight that access to complete replication data is
   particularly important in light of dynamically changing social media
   research conditions. Thus, the study raises concerns and potential
   solutions about the broader implications of nonrandom tweet mortality
   for future social media research on Twitter and similar platforms.},

Abstract = {What is the relationship between counterinsurgency and
   institution-building? When do wartime institutions persist once conflict
   has ended? Classic theories examine how war spurs new institutions
   within the central state, while extensive research on rebel governance
   examines how insurgent actors forge new rules to garner civilian
   compliance and cement control. However, the legacies of armed conflict
   for state institutions in the theater of war remain relatively
   neglected. We theorize the process of local counterinsurgent
   institution-building and the drivers of institutional endurance
   following counterinsurgency. By analyzing two local counterinsurgent
   institutions in Nicaragua and a shadow case drawn from Indonesia, we
   find that while state leaders may generate new institutional
   arrangements to elicit information and garner resources, institutional
   persistence is driven by local reappropriation as communities pursue
   their own postwar governance and development goals. Overall, this paper
   contributes a new understanding for the divergent postwar paths of local
   institutions generated amid counterinsurgency.},

Abstract = {Recent allegations that Pope John Paul II turned a blind eye to clergy
   sexual abuse as archbishop and pope have ignited much controversy in
   Poland. In this study, we utilize data from an original representative
   survey of Polish adults to examine predictors of defensive political
   reactions to these allegations. We hypothesized that national and
   Catholic collective narcissism (an exaggerated belief in in-group
   greatness that requires consistent external validation) would predict
   defensive attitudes in the face of the allegation, and that
   nonnarcissistic in-group satisfaction with national and Polish
   identities would be less related to defensive attitudes. Using a variety
   of statistical approaches, we find support for these predictions among
   Polish Catholics.},

Abstract = {Survey experiments are an important tool to measure policy preferences.
   Researchers often rely on the random assignment of policy attribute
   levels to estimate different types of average marginal effects. Yet,
   researchers are often interested in how respondents trade-off different
   policy dimensions. We use a conjoint experiment administered to more
   than 10,000 respondents in Germany, to study preferences over personal
   freedoms and public welfare during the COVID-19 crisis. Using a
   pre-registered structural model, we estimate policy ideal points and
   indifference curves to assess the conditions under which citizens are
   willing to sacrifice freedoms in the interest of public well-being. We
   document broad willingness to accept restrictions on rights alongside
   sharp heterogeneity with respect to vaccination status. The majority of
   citizens are vaccinated and strongly support limitations on freedoms in
   response to extreme conditions-especially, when they vaccinated
   themselves are exempted from these limitations. The unvaccinated
   minority prefers no restrictions on freedoms regardless of the severity
   of the pandemic. These policy packages also matter for reported trust in
   government, in opposite ways for vaccinated and unvaccinated citizens.},

Title = {The Domestic Determinants of Hedging in Singapore's Foreign Policy},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SOUTHEAST ASIA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In response to the intensifying US-China rivalry, Singapore ostensibly
   ``hedges{''}, a strategy that avoids choosing between Washington and
   Beijing and maximizes gains from cooperating with both powers while
   avoiding confrontation. Hedging also extenuates Singapore's central
   location in Asia and its role as an established commercial and financial
   hub. As such, it appears to reflect the imperative of any small state:
   survival. However, in contrast to the argument that domestic politics
   does not matter in Singapore's foreign policy, this article demonstrates
   how the domestic imperative of legitimizing the political dominance of
   the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) shapes the government's hedging
   strategy.},

Abstract = {Hitherto renowned for its economic and political development, Taiwan has

   agricultural, demographic, trade, and economic security problems
   altogether form a ``polycrisis{''} that makes it difficult to solve one
   set of problems without aggravating the others, and the democratic
   electoral process has unfortunately so far been unable to table a
   comprehensive ``polysolution.{''}},

Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article examines bureaucracies using a novel dataset of Chilean
   central government employees from 2006 to 2020. Unlike perception-based
   sources, this dataset provides objective, disaggregated, and
   longitudinal insights into bureaucrats' characteristics and careers. The
   authors validate it against official employment statistics and conduct
   an exploratory and descriptive analysis, presenting six descriptive
   findings about the Chilean bureaucracy that cannot be discovered using
   available aggregate data. The analysis reveals significant degrees of
   personnel stability and professionalization in the civil service, but
   with considerable rigidity in careers and substantial interagency
   heterogeneity in turnover, wages, and exposure to political cycles.
   These findings suggest that the Chilean national bureaucracy is mostly
   well developed along Weberian lines, though not uniformly so. These
   measurements also serve as a benchmark for comparing other Latin
   American bureaucracies in the future.},

Abstract = {This chapter explores the transformative dynamics in Turkiye-EU
   relations post-2010, particularly within the context of Turkish
   political elites' perceptions. The chapter underscores the profound
   impact of the strained Turkiye-EU ties, marked by blocked negotiation
   chapters and democratic backsliding. Emphasizing the shift from
   conditionality to transactionalism, it scrutinizes the evolving
   geopolitical landscape and realpolitik considerations, notably in light
   of the Ukraine war. The analysis centres on Turkish members of
   parliament involved in the Turkiye-EU Joint Parliamentary Committee,
   probing their perspectives on economic, security, and identity
   dimensions. Historical context, key events, and the concept of
   `peripherality' are examined, employing interviews and Committee meeting
   minutes. The chapter culminates in an assessment of recent perceptions
   of the EU perceptions among Turkish political elites, examining
   potential centreperiphery dynamics in bilateral relations.},

Abstract = {This chapter provides a theoretical and conceptual background that sheds
   light on EU-Kosovo relations from a core-periphery analytical
   perspective. Within this research purview, the study focuses on the
   examination of the three main areas of interaction - politics
   (identity), economy, and security - manifested in the framework of
   contractual relations within the process of Kosovo's integration into
   the EU. The study highlights the ambivalent attitudes of political
   elites in Kosovo, who, while resisting or contesting different aspects
   in relation to the EU, are still actively engaged in the EU integration
   process. Moreover, based on empirical data from original semi-structured
   interviews with representatives from the aforementioned elite, this
   chapter explores how the EU is perceived and contested in Kosovo within
   evolving circumstances in profoundly changed contexts, most recently the
   war in Ukraine.},

I explore aspects of this controversy in the pages that follow, but it is not a central focus.

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CURRENT SOUTHEAST ASIAN AFFAIRS},

Month = {2024 DEC 24},
Abstract = {The concept of ``ASEAN centrality{''} emerged in the aftermath of the
   Cold War but renewed power rivalries in the Indo-Pacific have put its
   relevance under scrutiny. This study contributes to the debate on the
   continuity of ASEAN centrality by examining major powers' willingness to
   adhere to and engage with ASEAN-led mechanisms, which we argue will have
   a decisive impact on the dominant form of the organisation of regional
   order. Our analysis shows that the major powers - China, the European
   Union, India, Japan, and the United States - subscribe to an enhanced
   role for ASEAN in the economic realm but do not see the mechanism as the
   first resort in political and security cooperation. ASEAN centrality is
   hard to continue, although a possible way out for ASEAN is to leverage
   its in-between position to help diffuse tensions so major powers have a
   stake in maintaining its centrality.},

Title = {Dialogical Health Communication via Twitter (X) During COVID-19 in
   African Countries: Ghana as a Case Study},

Abstract = {Social media platforms, such as Twitter (X), have a critical role in
   disseminating health information. The study aims to highlight the
   potential of Twitter (X) as an influential tool for health
   communication, in addition to providing findings related to public
   health communication strategies in Ghana. The study investigated the
   role of Twitter (X) as a platform for building interactive health
   communication between the health communication system and citizens in
   Ghana during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-2022. Additionally, it has
   the potential to contribute to building dialogical health communication.
   The study analyzed a sample of COVID-19-related tweets from the official
   Ghana Health Service Twitter (X) account @\_GHS from 2020 to 2022. The
   results showed that Twitter (X) was a key tool for health communication
   during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana, with both health institutions and
   the public sharing large amounts of health information. Furthermore, the
   study found evidence of dialogic communication, in which healthcare
   institutions and professionals are actively engaging with the public on
   Twitter (X). It concluded that public health communication on Twitter
   (X) has changed over time, as well as that the interactive health
   communication between the health communication system and citizens in
   Ghana was affected positively during the COVID-19 outbreak. It
   highlighted Twitter (X)'s potential as a tool for establishing a
   dialogue loop and building dialogic health communication. The results
   showed that before COVID-19, Ghana did not use Twitter (X) effectively
   to communicate with citizens about health matters. Twitter (X), with its
   wide reach and highly interactive nature through features such as
   retweets, has become a major platform for interactions facilitating
   dialogue between health institutions and health professionals and
   facilitating dialogue in public spaces surrounding health issues like
   COVID-19.},

Title = {Classrooms or Crackdowns? How Violence Affects Security Policy
   Preferences in Mexico},
Journal = {STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 31},
Abstract = {Penal policies have been the primary strategy of Latin American
   governments to combat crime, but preventative social policies such as
   youth education programmes may be more effective solutions. Penal and
   social policies are often treated as a trade-off by governments, who
   expect citizens-especially victims of violence-to be more supportive of
   punitive solutions. Using an original online survey experiment conducted
   in 2021 in Mexico, we challenge the idea of a trade-off between penal
   and social policies by studying how different policy solutions along the
   penal-welfare policy continuum affect victims' support for increased
   state security presence. We unpack differences between victims of
   criminal perpetrators and state violence and those who are fearful of
   crime. Our vignette experiment reveals-in contrast to previous
   results-that crime victims are more supportive of state security
   presence when coupled with pre-emptive measures. Surprisingly, the same
   holds for victims of state violence and for those fearful of crime,
   including those residing in neighbourhoods with watch groups.
   Victimisation, by either crime or the state, raises demand for policies
   to increase employment and improve education.},

Title = {Zakat, Non-state Welfare Provision and Redistribution in Times of
   Crisis: Evidence from the Covid-19 Pandemic},
Journal = {STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 26},
Abstract = {Around the world, the Covid-19 pandemic drew attention to state social
   protection and its limitations. Less attention has been paid to what is
   likely the world's largest system of predominantly non-state welfare
   provision: zakat, an annual Islamic obligatory payment of a percentage
   of productive wealth to the poor and other eligible recipients. We
   explore how states and citizens engage with zakat during crises through
   a case study of the Covid-19 pandemic in Pakistan, Egypt, and Morocco,
   drawing on novel and nationally representative survey data of 5484
   respondents across the three countries. While we may expect that
   citizens may be less motivated to pay zakat in times of personal
   economic hardship, we find that a large majority of the general
   population and of zakat contributors perceives zakat as particularly
   important in the Covid context. We show that while zakat may play an
   important role in non-state social welfare provision supplementing state
   social protection and redistribution in times of crisis, state attempts
   to harness it are often ineffective. However, while we find that higher
   income individuals are more likely to pay zakat, even only among those
   that are eligible, there are potentially negative equity impacts given
   the flat rate at which it is levied and the fact that people tend to
   give through personal networks.},

Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 5},
Abstract = {Using examples from West Africa, this paper argues that Salafism has
   become modular. In interrelated trends, some Salafis have revised their
   postures towards other Muslims, while some non-Salafis selectively adopt
   elements of Salafism; both trends lead to forms of `post-Salafism'. The
   paper investigates three facets of these nascent `post-Salafi' trends.
   First, Salafis have championed the hadith report as the main currency of
   evidence-giving in religious debate, but have lost `market share' in the
   interpretation of hadith. Second, intellectuals trained in comparative
   jurisprudence can stake out an appealing middle ground between Salafism
   and traditionalism. Third, Salafis' need for coalition partners in
   politics and society can blur the boundaries of Salafism, even to the
   point that some Salafis compromise on anti-Sufism, a core element of
   Salafism. Discussing Nigeria, Mauritania, and Mali, the paper highlights
   how local contextual factors have affected the construction of Muslim
   identity since the 1990s. These factors include democratic openings,
   exhaustion with Sufi-Salafi polemics, the appeal of Shi'ism, and mass
   protests with religious colourations.},

   current of Islam in France},
Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 3},
Abstract = {The issue of Salafism has become central to public debate in France
   today. While the Salafi movement in France has been portrayed in
   politics and media alike as a major security threat opposed to
   republican principles, its sociology reveals more complex patterns than
   one of radicalism alone, especially from a long-term perspective. An
   empirical analysis of discourses, behaviours and mobilization strategies
   within these puritanical fundamentalist communities leads us to
   hypothesize that since the early 2000s, the radicalism initially
   displayed by Salafism has proved unsustainable. Through looking at the
   long-term life trajectories of Salafi believers, we propose an overview
   of the different biographic scenarios that characterize these actors.
   What can we say about the way in which they have reinforced,
   reformulated, nuanced, or broken their ties with their Salafi
   socialisation? We show that Salafism in France today can be
   characterized as a fundamentalism diluted by a broader global dynamic of
   distrust towards violence and classic forms of political militancy,
   while at the same time maintaining claims to certain forms of religious
   radicalism. Based on a micro-sociological approach, we examine whether
   the respective prefixes `neo' or `post' most accurately characterize the
   long-term evolution of French Salafism.},

Abstract = {This article considers Turkey as an archetypal example of the
   semi-periphery, neither entirely beholden to international rules and
   norms nor free to set them. We focus on three leading export sectors -
   textiles and garments, automotives and infrastructure - and analyze how
   the Turkish state and associated industrial firms have worked to
   navigate the complicated demands of cost-competitiveness while
   increasing the production of value-added goods. We find that the Turkish
   state and firms have adopted a mix of strategies for integrating with
   export markets, combining neoliberal adherence to the rules and norms of
   Western markets through global value chains with neomercantilist efforts
   to direct cross-border trade and investment toward the Balkans, Middle
   East, and Central Asia. Although neoliberalism and neomercantilism are
   traditionally treated as opposing approaches to international economic
   integration, we find that, for semi-peripheral countries like Turkey,
   these strategies are not contradictory but rather complementary, as they
   reduce exposure to the volatility and dependence upon Western markets.
   While the success of these efforts varies across industries and types of
   firms, we suggest that such dualistic approaches may be a key strategy
   for semi-peripheral countries seeking to minimize their dependence on
   Western markets while exerting economic influence in their near abroad.},

Abstract = {Since the so-called war on drugs began in Mexico in 2006, the military
   has been the leading actor in charge of the government's public security
   policy, undertaking tasks that should be carried out by the police.
   Analyses of this security strategy are based on quantitative methods and
   have focused on its results: e.g., an increase in the homicide rate or
   the committing of human rights violations. In contrast, based on
   in-depth interviews, this article explores the testimony of military
   personnel to understand what they experience in the field. Contrary to
   what the existing literature argues, which maintains that the military
   acts with a logic of war, this article shows that the situation is far
   more complex: they act in a scenario characterized by improvisation,
   facing the dilemma between acting and being accused of human rights or
   not acting and being accused of disobedience.},

Abstract = {Research on territorial preferences in self-determination disputes has
   traditionally focused on economic and identity-related factors. However,
   the impact of social costs-encompassing overall societal comfort and
   conviviality-on specific preferences for territorial strategies remains
   understudied. This paper presents a novel perspective by investigating
   how social costs affect such policy preferences in Catalonia, a region
   in Spain where secession has become a politically salient and defining
   feature of the political debate in recent decades. Through embedded
   experiments conducted within regionally representative online surveys
   over two time periods, we examine the relationship between social costs
   and preferences for territorial strategies. Our theoretical framework
   and empirical findings underscore the importance of considering social
   costs as a determinant of policy preferences, warranting further
   cross-national exploration-beyond territorial debates.},

Abstract = {What sort of welfare regime does Brunei have? How does it compare to
   other countries' welfare schemes? How will it change as Brunei seeks to
   diversify away from its dependency on hydrocarbon resources? Using the
   ``welfare diamond{''} framework, this article argues that Brunei
   currently operates a ``protective welfare regime{''}. However, if it
   succeeds in reducing its reliance on hydrocarbon resources, that system
   will transition towards a modern monarchical welfare-regime model
   wherein self-reliant individuals and resilient communities will play an
   increasingly significant role while the role of the state will diminish.},

Abstract = {In recent years, climate governance has shifted from the global,
   multilateral regime to voluntary initiatives from multiple directions.
   Scholars frequently use a polycentric governance lens to study the
   complex and multijurisdictional reality. The polycentric perspective
   helps to grasp the new reality at a general level, but it is lacking in
   specificity. To fill this research gap, this article attempts to enhance
   the analytical power of the polycentric governance perspective by
   exploring four issues: the role of the state, diffusion of local action,
   integration of local democratic preferences, and the role of power.
   These issues are discussed by doing a systematic literature review of
   empirical polycentric governance literature regarding climate change
   mitigation. The results show the importance of states at the national
   level and provide insights into how local initiatives share and transfer
   knowledge, get supported by transnational networks, and secure
   compliance with local democratic preferences. The literature provides
   less insight into the role of power. The article concludes by developing
   research agendas for further cumulation of knowledge and to strengthen
   climate action at all levels.},

Abstract = {The ontological security dynamics of EU foreign policy cooperation and
   integration have been relatively under-researched. The EU's efforts to
   seek ontological security - by consolidating myths, solidifying
   identifications, and positioning itself on the international crisis -
   have been discussed by Della Sala, Mitzen, Rumelili, and others, yet one
   question remains: can the EU provide ontological security? International
   crises can be an important entry point for studying the dynamics of
   ontological security within the EU. In this paper, I analyse how France
   and the European External Action Service (EEAS) narrated the 2011
   uprisings in Tunisia. I argue that the EU acts as an ontological
   security provider in this case by providing a stable network of meaning,
   narrative, and social space. In the case of Tunisia, I argue that the
   revelation of the mismatch between its self-perception and perception of
   others led to significant ontological stress for France and that leaning
   on the EU provided a way out of this uncertainty. By leaning on the EUs
   narration of events, France could move past its own stress and still
   feel secure as part of the EU.},

Abstract = {This paper revisits core pieces of literature on EU foreign policy
   studies to gauge how far the endogenous institutional quality of EU
   foreign policy structures has matured by assessing its growth over time.
   In revisiting two foundational studies, it discusses whether the EU's
   foreign policy capabilities are still so unequivocally below the state
   level. First, it will return to the ``capabilities-expectations gap{''}
   {[}Hill, C., 1993. The capability-expectations gap, or conceptualizing
   Europe's international role. Journal of Common Market Studies, 31 (3),
   305-328] to investigate the quality of the institutional structure in
   foreign policy and in how far the EU's institutions fulfil general
   functions of foreign policy today. Second, it will explore whether ``Who
   Speaks for Europe?{''} is still a pertinent question {[}Allen, D., 1998.
   Who speaks for Europe? The search for an effective and coherent external
   policy. In: J. Peterson, and H. Sjursen, eds. A common foreign policy
   for Europe? Competing visions of the CFSP. 41-58]. The results of this
   assessment allow a conceptualisation of foreign policy capabilities
   evolving in long-term, slow processes, yet resulting in differences in
   institutional quality that may otherwise be overlooked. The paper
   contributes to the overall assessment of the EU's maturation in foreign
   policy by providing assessments on institutional growth and developing a
   scale of foreign policy capabilities to capture these slow incremental
   developments.},

Abstract = {Since the seminal terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, the emergence
   of the new terrorism has been epitomised by rise of radical Islamist
   terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Through the use
   of new terrorism techniques and strategies, such movements have been
   able to transform themselves into worldwide, global jihadist movements.
   While the Islamic State appeared to have gained the upper hand over Al
   Qaeda in the competition over the radical Islamist cause due to its
   successes in Iraq and Syria in 2014, analysts believe that in the
   long-run, Al Qaeda remains the greater danger. While both Al Qaeda and
   the Islamic State have suffered greatly from vigorous and sustained
   global counter-terrorism operations led by the United States, their
   local affiliates in the Indo-Pacific, as well as other local radical
   Islamist and non-Islamist groups not affiliated to either, have
   continued to pose serious terrorist challenges in the region. While the
   threat has somewhat abated in recent times in Southeast Asia, the
   terrorist threat remains very serious in South Asia.},

Volume = {30},
Number = {3},
Pages = {399-403},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Drawing on the neo-Durkheimian cultural sociology of Jeffrey Alexander
   and Anthony Smith's ethno-symbolic approach, Schertzer and Woods argue
   that contemporary `populist' movements in France, the US and the UK are
   better understood as `ethno-nationalist' movements. In this, they join a
   recent spate of revisionist work that emphasises the role of
   ethno-nationalism and White supremacism in the historical trajectories
   of these supposedly `civic' nations. The central weakness of this
   approach and of their argument is that it detaches symbolic struggles
   from material ones and in-group solidarity from out-group violence.
   Here, Bourdieu's theory of class-ification struggles and the dark
   Durkheimianism of the mid-20th century provides a helpful supplement.},

Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Western media and politicians often describe the unprecedented
   devastation since October 7th uncritically accepting three notions.
   First, that Arab governments vigorously oppose Israel's actions. Yet,
   despite the Palestinian question being central to their domestic
   politics and despite energy suppliers' leverage over energy-insecure
   Western states, Arab regimes have issued little more than stern
   statements. Second, while Israel justifies its violence claiming it will
   eliminate armed groups and armed resistance per se, scholarship shows
   this strategy produces the opposite effect. Third, although `two-state
   solutions' are presented as the only realistic pathways to peace, since
   1978 they display similar structures and fail in similar ways, raising
   the question of why policymakers insist on a failing strategy. This
   contribution sketches how key characteristics of the Palestine/Israel
   question's colonial roots and post-independence regimes' strategies of
   power explains these contradictions and how they lead to `palliative'
   peace processes which defer structural solutions rather than advance
   them.},

Abstract = {The article studies the personal experience and meaning of nationalism
   for Finnish mid-nineteenth-century national protagonists from the gender
   perspective. Using the concept of personal nationalism and the group
   biographical approach, the article analyses experiential and narrative
   self-construction in the correspondence exchanged between members of the
   key family of the contemporary Finnish national circles, the Tengstroms.
   I argue that nationalism had a deep personal, even existential, meaning
   for these people. However, there were differences in the ways men and
   women could tap into nationalism as a resource of self-construction and
   in the ways they could embody and express their personal nationalism.
   The national meanings were, in the end, somehow branded as masculine.
   Men tied the national cause intensively and explicitly to their entire
   existence, for instance, through emotional friendships and nationalised
   careers. Women had to use detours, like constructing proper national
   womanhood through countertypes and mediating their national engagement
   through men.},

Abstract = {Since the EU accession in 2004 Poland witnessed the biggest migration
   flows in the contemporary history, first mainly outflows to the Western
   European countries and recently also inflows from Eastern European
   countries. This movements have been a challenge especially for local
   communities experiencing an influx of significant numbers of people. The
   aim of this paper is to assess the interrelated nature of the two
   parallel processes of migration inflow and outflow. The two key
   questions are raised: how do multidirectional migrations influence the
   territorial dimension of the convergence process observed since the 1990
   systemic transformation? and how these processes have been perceived
   among those who participate in them directly, and other inhabitants of
   receiving/sending areas? To allow for and facilitate comparisons between
   various aspects of migration the PESTEL analytical framework was used.
   The research confirmed that migrations influence the development and
   living standards in terms both structural and spatial. The perception of
   migratory processes differs between the representatives of local
   government (opportunity) and regular inhabitants (also a threat). These
   are mostly not just the kind of concerns known from Western European
   examples (cultural differences and competition on the labour market), as
   they often involve anxieties regarding access to public services.},

Title = {Anti-corruption Audits and Citizens' Trust in Audit and Auditee
   Institutions},

Abstract = {Anticorruption audits may deter corruption and signal to citizens that
   institutions are proactively combating it. However, by detecting and
   reporting corruption, audits might also unintentionally erode trust in
   institutions. Therefore, the impact of audits potentially hinges on
   whether they uncover corruption. Audit institutions, not implicated in
   the corruption they uncover, might be less likely to experience a
   decline in trust compared to auditee institutions. This study uses
   survey and administrative data from Brazil, leveraging a federal
   anti-corruption program that randomly selects municipalities for
   auditing. Results do not support the claim that audits boost
   institutional trust. Individuals in audited municipalities show no
   different levels of trust in local government or the audit institution
   than those in non-audited municipalities, and the coefficients may even
   indicate a negative effect. Additionally, audit institutions may not be
   better insulated from the corrosive effects of uncovering corruption
   than the institutions they audit.},

Abstract = {This paper offers a nuanced examination of EU external governance within
   the challenging terrain of `embedded stalemate', utilizing a network
   governance lens. Focusing on the Turkish transport sector as a case
   study, the research seeks to unravel the determinants of EU compliance
   in areas characterized by a protracted political impasse. By
   investigating the intricate dynamics of this `embedded stalemate', the
   paper explores the question: `How do various factors influence the
   compliance with the EU in the Turkish transport sector amid a prolonged
   stalemate characterized by the absence of benchmarks and deadlines?'
   Through 11 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, ranging
   from Turkish Ministry officials to private transport advisors, the study
   identifies variables such as incentives, actor capacities, asymmetry of
   interdependence, socialization, and politicization as crucial forces
   influencing the trajectory of compliance. The conceptual framework of
   network governance is introduced, providing a theoretical lens to
   understand the complex web of actors and preferences in this dynamic
   landscape. Therefore, the study concludes that as a result of `embedded
   stalemate', patchy compliance is achieved through prolonged and
   dynamically evolving network governance involving a diverse array of
   actors from both the EU and Turkey sides.},

Abstract = {Since 2008, the European Union (EU) witnessed a growing tension between
   the social and economic dimensions of integration as a consequence of
   the `polycrisis'. The increasing politicisation of EU issues in national
   political arenas that led to the rise of Eurosceptic parties mostly
   revolved around the issue of European solidarity. Against this
   background, this study investigates the congruence between voters and
   incumbent members of national parliaments on the highly contentious
   aspects of EU solidarity. First, the article maps the extent to which
   national political elites share similar views on EU solidarity with
   their voters. Secondly, we assess members of parliaments (MPs)-voters'
   congruence at the party level. Employing original data from an elite and
   a mass survey conducted in six EU countries between 2017 and 2018, we
   find that both voters and MPs expressed a high level of support for
   policies strengthening European solidarity in the Eurozone periphery.
   Instead, voters in Northern and Eastern EU member states shared more
   positive preferences than their national representatives. Furthermore,
   the party-voter distance was higher for radical-right Eurosceptic MPs,
   especially in Northern Europe, than for other parties.},

Volume = {34},

Abstract = {The paper outlines the most likely scenarios of the future European
   security architecture based on an analysis of several drivers, such as
   Russia's leadership's perception of Ukraine, the mindset of the Putinist
   elite, Russia's state geopolitics, the domestic situation and prospects
   of a regime change in Russia, economic sanctions against Russia, energy
   and the export of Russia's energy resources, and the positions of key
   Euratlantic actors. The current ``unstable balance model{''} will remain
   the most likely scenario in case of a conservation of the situation on
   the Ukrainian battlefields. Since the concert model of security
   architecture entails a lack of a revisionist agenda among all the
   actors, the only reasonably probable security management upgrade is a
   ``positive stable balance{''}. This scenario is conditioned on degrading
   Russia's military capacity, Ukraine's military advancements on the
   battlefields, a weakening of the Russian economy and maintaining the
   support for Ukraine in the EU and NATO.},

Abstract = {In today's competitive information environment, clicks are the currency
   of the digital media landscape. Clickbait journalism attempts to entice
   attention with provocative and sensational headlines, but what are the
   implications when public opinion polls are the hook? Does the use of
   survey clickbait-news stories that make misleading claims about public
   opinion-have implications for perceptions of the public, journalists, or
   the polling industry? In two survey experiments conducted in the United
   States, we find that exposure to apolitical survey clickbait that makes
   exaggerated claims about the incompetence of the American public
   undermines perceptions of their capacity for democratic citizenship. At
   the same time, we find no evidence that this type of survey clickbait
   damages the reputations of the media or polling industry, suggesting
   that the media may have perverse incentives to use low-quality polls or
   to misrepresent polling results to drive traffic.},

Abstract = {The Philippines' foreign policy is anchored on three pillars: the
   protection of territorial integrity and sovereignty; economic
   development; and the protection of overseas Filipinos. Since these
   tenets were first enunciated by the Ramos administration (1992-98), they
   have remained constant despite perceptions that subsequent presidents
   have gravitated towards a closer partnership with the United States or
   China. Alternatively, it has been said that Manila partners with a
   particular foreign power to advance a particular pillar, thus creating a
   de facto division of roles: the United States is an ally that protects
   the Philippines' territorial integrity and sovereignty, while China is a
   partner that advances economic development. However, the notion of a
   division of responsibilities is somewhat superficial. In reality, the
   Philippines' relations with both the United States and China contribute
   to all three pillars.},

Abstract = {Since 2015, the European Commission has sought to highlight the EU's
   promise of protection by introducing the idea of a ``Security Union{''}.
   This article examines how officials and bureaucrats within the European
   Commission make sense of this project. So far, the few explicit studies
   on the Security Union focus on its historical genesis and formal policy
   outputs and tend to view it as a symbolic and diffuse initiative that
   lacks coherent implementation and potentially undermines fundamental
   rights. The article goes beyond that by analysing how officials and
   bureaucrats in the EU's ``engine room{''} perceive and deal with the
   Security Union. Drawing on research on the everyday dimensions of
   European integration and administrative bureaucracy, the article
   explores officials' views and self-understandings as well as their
   routines and interactions in their daily work. For this purpose, it uses
   novel empirical data from personal interviews with administrative
   officials in Brussels. On this basis, the study highlights the
   importance of skilled individuals and personal interactions that can
   have lasting impact even when formal institutional structures erode.
   Moreover, it shows how everyday exchanges and experiences within the
   Security Union context can change officials' self-understandings as
   security actors based on a broad security narrative.},

Abstract = {Wetlands provide ecosystem services such as flood protection, improved
   water quality, and wildlife habitat, but are under attack in urban
   land-use conflicts in the Global South. This article presents two cases
   of local wetlands governance conflicts in Colombia (Humedal la Conejera,
   Bogota, Cundinamarca) and Argentina (Laguna de Rocha, Esteban
   Echeverria, Gran Buenos Aires) to illustrate divergent pathways toward
   improved environmental governance via citizen pressures: the
   collaborative method (Bogota) and the adversarial method (Buenos Aires).
   While existing scholarship on citizen-led regulation stresses the
   importance of collaboration between community organizations and the
   state, this article argues that adversarial tactics are also a key
   component of environmental governance. In both cases, citizen-led
   pressures led to increased enforcement of regulatory measures to restore
   wetlands and gain protected-area status. Citizen-led governance involved
   adversarial strategies such as marches, litigation, and shaming and
   blaming in the media, as well as collaborative strategies such as
   creating broad-based educational forums, working inside city government,
   and partnering directly with public institutions to set new policies.
   Against the backdrop of extensive collusion between elected officials
   and land developers, citizen-led subnational environmental governance
   has become the regulatory regime of last resort in urban Latin America.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do incumbents support, tolerate, or try to rein in
   armed groups within their borders? The paper argues that incumbents
   strategize toward armed groups in ways that help them manage the ruling
   coalition and remain in power. I find that incumbents support armed
   groups in provinces where provincial politicians have defected from the
   ruling coalition to opposition parties, recruiting armed groups to
   deliver the province in national elections with fraud and violence and
   punish elite defectors. Where incumbents are not fighting to keep
   provinces in the ruling coalition, I show that they tolerate
   non-dissident groups that enjoy social contracts with local communities,
   and try to contain their dissident counterparts. Incumbents are likely
   to repress predatory armed groups, dissident and non-dissident alike.
   Doing so helps boost elite and mass support for incumbents and project
   central government power into the province. The argument was inductively
   built with comparative case studies from Nigeria and then evaluated in
   Kenya. The findings contribute to an important research agenda on
   government-armed group relationships and carry implications for security
   sector aid and reform.},

Abstract = {The literature on national solidarity is puzzled by the question of how
   solidarity can bridge social differences and has not asked how it works
   through sameness; that question was relegated to the literature on
   national identity. But can solidarity create nationhood through
   sameness? This theoretical article rehabilitates Durkheim's underused
   concept of mechanical solidarity and proposes to study sameness not as a
   human given, identity or group quality, but as a social performance that
   constitutes similarity between people and thus also solidarity. Whilst
   mechanical solidarity can function in all types of groups, it is
   particularly prominent in the context of nationhood. To explain how, the
   article explores performances of national customs related to food, which
   convey a conformist and unreflective subjectivity as well as horizontal
   unanimity. When people do things collectively, they perform national
   solidarity without necessarily indicating a collective identity that
   exists out there or agreeing about ideas and values. Contrary to common
   stereotypes of modern societies as `complex', the article underscores
   sameness as crucial to modern nationalism-still the most significant
   socio-political principle of our era.},

Title = {Ordering Effects versus Cognitive Burden: How Should We Structure
   Attributes in Conjoint Experiments?},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {88},
Number = {3},
Pages = {991-1016},

Abstract = {Conjoint experiments offer a flexible way to elicit population
   preferences on complex decision tasks. We investigate whether we can
   improve respondents' survey experience and, ultimately, choice quality
   by departing from the current recommendation of completely randomized
   conjoint attribute ordering. Such random ordering guarantees that
   potential bias from attribute order cancels out on average. However, in
   situations with many attributes, this may unnecessarily increase
   cognitive burden, as attributes belonging together conceptually are
   presented scattered across the choice table. Hence, we study
   experimentally whether purposeful ordering ({''}theoretically
   important{''} attributes first) or block randomized ordering (attributes
   belonging to the same theoretical concept displayed in randomized
   bundles) affects survey experience, response time, and choice itself, as
   compared to completely randomized ordering. Drawing on a complex
   preregistered choice design with nine attributes (N = 6,617), we find
   that ordering type affects neither self-reported survey experience,
   choice task timing, nor attribute weighting. Potentially, block
   randomization reduces cognitive burden for some subgroups. To our
   knowledge, we thereby provide the first systematic empirical evidence
   that ordering effects are likely of low relevance in conjoint choice
   experiments and that the trade-off between cognitive burden and ordering
   effects is minimal from the perspective of respondents, at least for our
   substantive application.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the challenges of operational analysis as displayed
   in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Despite the tremendous success of
   strategic warning, analysts grossly over-estimated conventional Russian
   military capabilities and under-estimated the Ukrainians' capability and
   will. Even after observing Russia's operational capabilities and
   tactics, analysts again over-estimated Russia's ability to secure
   Eastern Ukraine. This study finds that poor understanding of military
   campaigns is the result of six contributing factors. One, risk
   management requires tradeoffs based on competing priorities and finite
   resources inevitably creating blind spots. Two, there can be
   insufficient collection for operational details due to a focus on
   strategic requirements or tactical intelligence. Three, an insufficient
   number of analysts required to cover a breadth of topics leaving them
   susceptible to challenges like mirror-imaging or single source bias,
   culminates in poor analysis. Four, Russian and Western external and
   internal strategic narratives were filled with deception. Fifth, despite
   `need to share' policies, information stovepipes continue to plague
   Western intelligence agencies. Finally, a lack of professional wargaming
   can lead to an analysis-centric view that ignores the valuable expertise
   of operators and logisticians. Each of these factors contributed to
   analysts' poor understanding of the operational level of war in the
   Russia-Ukraine conflict.},

Abstract = {Since the establishment of the EEAS as the EU's diplomatic service and
   the transformation of the EU's representation abroad into EU
   Delegations, the EU has been a pioneer in multilateral diplomacy and
   contributed to development in its wider neighbourhood. These bodies made
   a significant contribution to widening the EU's diplomatic network and
   strengthening its position in foreign policy and external relations.
   However, EU Delegations play a minimal role in the EU's crisis
   management efforts despite their presence on the ground and their useful
   recourses, which could, in fact, provide crucial assets to EU-led
   missions. While the EU has shown successes in diplomacy, its Delegations
   face the problems of multiple principals and non-exclusive delegation
   which risk undermining the EU's overall capacities as a global actor.
   This article applies the PA model to illustrate these dual problems in
   the cases of the CSDP missions conducted in Mali and Ukraine.},

Title = {China's Promoting of Authoritarian-Westphalian Democracy and Its
   Implications for the Liberal International Order},
Journal = {ISSUES \& STUDIES},
Year = {2024},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {China is seen as undemocratic, illiberal, and autocratic by many who
   live outside it, and the terms ``democracy{''} and ``China{''} are often
   difficult to reconcile. Nonetheless, Beijing has been actively employing
   the concept of democracy both domestically and on the international
   stage in recent years. This paper aims to critically examine how Beijing
   conceptualizes and advocates for democracy at home and abroad. It also
   endeavors to explore the implications for the country's domestic and
   global governance, particularly in relation to the US-centered liberal
   international order in the context of critical international relations
   studies. In so doing, this paper will focus methodologically on
   Beijing's official documents and state media outlets, presenting an
   argument that is twofold. First, by promoting its unique form of
   democracy known as ``whole-process people's democracy,{''} Beijing
   domestically intertwines democracy with authoritarianism, hierarchy, and
   dictatorship. This whole-process people's democracy appears to function
   at home as a tool of regime security that is characterized by a rule
   that is of and for the people but not by the people. Second, China on
   the international stage has adopted Western-style liberal values to
   advocate for enhanced democracy in international relations. Through its
   strategic adoption of these liberal values, Beijing accuses the United
   States of a hegemonic liberal hypocrisy in international relations while
   appearing to aspire to a world that is fragmented into essentially
   different entities.},

Abstract = {This study examines the determinants influencing clean food purchasing
   decisions among consumers in the lower northeastern region of Thailand.
   It addresses the significant research gap in understanding the interplay
   between product attributes, cultural background, and healthy eating
   behaviors. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior, this study employs a
   questionnaire survey with 392 valid responses, analyzed through
   structural equation modeling. Results indicate that both product
   attributes and cultural background significantly impact healthy eating
   behaviors, which, in turn, mediate their effects on clean food
   purchasing decisions. Specifically, healthy eating behaviors were found
   to partially mediate the relationship between product attributes and
   purchasing decisions, as well as between cultural background and
   purchasing decisions. The findings underscore the importance of
   promoting product attributes and cultural awareness to enhance healthy
   eating behaviors, thereby encouraging clean food purchases. This
   research provides valuable insights for policymakers and marketers
   aiming to foster healthier eating habits through targeted interventions
   and culturally sensitive marketing strategies.},

Title = {Selective adherence to EU values and the quest for external coherence: a
   comparative discourse analysis of Czechia, Hungary, and Norway Amid
   Russia's war in Ukraine},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2025},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Russia's invasion of Ukraine has compelled the EU to adopt 13 sanction
   packages against Russia, demonstrating increased external coherence in
   the EU's foreign policy. This consensus can potentially drive a more
   robust upgrade, further fortifying the Union's external coherence.
   However, this progress is compromised by selective adherence to the EU's
   values. Employing a multi-tiered theoretical framework, the study
   hypothesises that external coherence is rooted in a matrix of legal
   frameworks, policy discourses, and contributions from external actors.
   Using critical discourse analysis, the research investigates how
   selective adherence impacts the EU's external coherence by comparing the
   discourses of four actors: Czechia, Hungary, the European External
   Action Service (EEAS), and Norway. Findings reveal that selective
   adherence to EU values is least evident in Hungary, moderately present
   in Czechia, and most pronounced in Norway, with the EEAS striving to
   promote coherence despite legislative constraints. While Russia's war in
   Ukraine has significantly impacted the EU, selective adherence to EU
   values has nonetheless contributed to fragmented external coherence in
   its foreign policy, undermining the Union's international credibility
   and geopolitical position.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate how trust in traditional and social media
   correlate with misperceptions of electoral integrity. Relying on
   insights from political communication research on exposure to
   misinformation and selective exposure mechanisms, as well as insights on
   the different roles of traditional and social media in different regime
   types, we argue that misperceptions of election integrity are likely
   driven in large part by the interplay between the trust people have in
   different media sources and the context (i.e., the level of press
   freedom) in which the elections take place. Using data from a survey
   conducted in 25 countries across the world, we find that trust in
   information from traditional media decreases misperceptions, while trust
   in information from social media increases misperceptions. However, both
   these effects are smaller when press freedom is restricted. In countries
   with low levels of press freedom, trust in social media is even
   associated with lower levels of misperceptions.},

Abstract = {In 2016, The United Nations (UN) issued the Plan of Action to Prevent
   Violent Extremism that prescribes member states to adopt a National
   Action Plan (NAP) to combat violent extremism through
   whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. A key aspect of the
   whole-of-society approach is to involve civil society organisations
   (CSOs). The collapse of the New Order regime in Indonesia, coupled with
   shifting global focus to P/CVE agendas, granted them wide latitude to
   pursue their objectives and the right environment to flourish. However,
   the mushrooming of P/CVE CSOs in Indonesia exposes the country to
   challenges such as uncoordinated programmes and competition. This
   article argues that these experiences prompted Indonesia to interpret
   the concept of the whole-of-society approach and to formulate a common
   NAP for relevant stakeholders to refer to. The NAP provides an official
   categorisation to assess the implementation of P/CVE programmes and
   identify required interventions. It also encourages all relevant
   stakeholders in the field to develop a unified database and a formal
   working mechanism among them. The availability of such regulations and
   mechanisms is critical to enhancing the impact of P/CVE initiatives,
   including the contributions of CSOs.},

Abstract = {The war on Ukraine is the most severe security crisis that Europe, and
   the European Union (EU), has faced since World War II. Contrary to what
   many expected, the EU responded quickly and comprehensively to the
   Russian invasion. How, if in any way, does the EU's response to the war
   on Ukraine suggest that the EU is coming of age in the foreign and
   security domain? By exploring EU policies and actions across three key
   maturation processes, our analysis finds that the EU has become a more
   mature foreign policy actor, in a process that started well before the
   Russian full scale invasion but has escalated since then. With its broad
   response to the war on Ukraine, the EU has shown an increased ability to
   take quick decisions, provide resources and combine various instruments
   in response to a crisis (increased decision-making ability); it is
   taking on a clearer foreign policy role/identity as a principled
   pragmatist and crisis manager (more stable identity status); and this
   plays out in its relations with the US, in NATO and bilaterally (more
   salient and defined relations).},

Abstract = {This study investigates the empowering potential of digital technologies
   for women entrepreneurs, a transformative force that transcends all
   fields of knowledge. It specifically examines how technology can equip
   women to overcome socio-cultural and economic barriers, focusing on the
   case of Iran. The research employs a mixed-methods approach, utilizing a
   literature review within the qualitative framework to identify key
   empowerment drivers. Subsequently, a quantitative approach leverages
   DEMATEL to pinpoint the most impactful drivers. This investigation aims
   to provide stakeholders with actionable insights, highlighting the
   critical role of technology in fostering equitable and sustainable
   economic advancement for women entrepreneurs. Furthermore, the study
   emphasizes the importance of gathering information from a developing
   nation like Iran, as its findings can hold significant implications for
   other countries experiencing similar developmental stages. Ultimately,
   the research seeks to inform the creation of effective policies, support
   initiatives, and educational programs. These interventions aim to
   empower women entrepreneurs to leverage digital tools for sustainable
   business growth, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and
   environmentally conscious future.},

   Jinping and His Mass-Line Sensibilities},
Journal = {ISSUES \& STUDIES},

Abstract = {This paper addresses a lacuna in the literature concerning how a ruler's
   ideas shape their attitudes toward the world and others through their
   personality. It examines the political ideas of Chinese President Xi
   Jinping as his references to the self-in-relation rather than his schema
   to assess and treat alters-in-relation. In addition to allowing
   political actors to assess the world and engage in policymaking,
   personality may inspire them to use ideas conversely to prepare
   themselves for the acceptance of their perceived constituencies. In
   terms of Xi Jinping's evolving personality, an initial need to overcome
   his individual vulnerability by becoming one with the masses has grown
   into a quest for transcendence that is informed by the following
   elements: (1) Buddhism while practicing the Party self; (2) the notion
   of Confucian harmony for the self-cultivation of Party cadres while
   practicing the national self; and (3) a socialist sensitivity to the
   material needs of the disadvantaged while practicing the international
   self. This has been demonstrated through programs that include his
   anti-corruption campaigns, his Chinese dream of anti-poverty, and his
   notion of a shared future of humankind. This paper compares the Kyoto
   School's use of Buddhism, Mao's use of Confucianism, and Pol Pot's use
   of Maoism. It also discusses how an autocracy can suffer from
   involution.},

Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between environmentalism and
   nationalism, including eco-nationalism, from comparative empirical
   survey studies. This study uses the Integrated Value Survey dataset,
   comprising approximately 240,000 respondents from 100 countries since
   2010, to explore nationalism and pro-environmental attitudes among
   public opinion across various countries. From a global perspective, a
   positive correlation between national pride or national identity and
   environmentalism is observed among many countries, whereas in a few
   regions, namely, certain parts of Western Europe and North America, both
   sentiments exhibit a negative correlation. Further regression analysis
   indicates that eco-nationalism and green nationalism tend to emerge in
   less economically developed countries but are not affected by the degree
   of democracy, resource rent and level of globalisation. This study
   demonstrates that the link between environmentalism and nationalism is
   not definitive but contextual, and it clarifies the context that defines
   it through empirical international comparisons.},

Abstract = {Christian nationalism, the fusion of religious and national identities,
   has emerged as an important factor shaping public opinion on a range of
   issues. However, debates in the existing literature on the motivations
   behind support for Christian nationalism remain unresolved: Is Christian
   nationalism a response to secularization and/or a cover for discomfort
   with racial diversity and equality? Is Christian nationalism rooted in
   fear of social change, disgust about social change, or something else?
   We use an experiment embedded in a national survey of adults to isolate
   the effects of knowledge of both religious and racial demographic change
   among White Christians. Our analysis suggests that exposure to religious
   demographic change shifts support for Christian nationalism and
   perceptions of discrimination against Whites and Christians, but
   exposure to racial demographic change has limited impact. This effect is
   mediated by emotion-religious demographic change increases fear and
   disgust, which then influence support for Christian nationalism and
   perceptions of discrimination against Whites and Christians. Although
   our treatment suggesting exposure to racial demographic change had null
   effects, we note that racial attitudes do independently influence
   support for Christian nationalism and perceptions of discrimination
   against Whites and Christians.},

Abstract = {Domestic politics has shaped the foreign policy of Laos (formally the
   Lao Peoples' Democratic Republic, or LPDR) since the 1970s, specifically
   its relations with China and the United States. During the 1980s, the
   communist government of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP)
   feared that China and the United States were supporting
   counter-revolutionary resistance groups, prompting Vientiane to adopt
   closer relations with Beijing and Washington to ensure its own internal
   security by motivating them to cut off their support for anti-LPRP
   groups. As the Soviet Union reduced economic aid to Laos in the latter
   stages of the Cold War, the LPRP adopted market -based reforms in 1986
   to generate closer security and economic cooperation with China and the
   United States and to grow its economy. Domestic concerns of regime
   survival and performance legitimacy remain key drivers of Laos' foreign
   policy.},

Abstract = {There are many warnings about growing political cynicism in the news and
   political science literature. While some people may be truly cynical
   about politics, for others cynical responses to politics may be a form
   of impression management-the practice of presenting oneself to others in
   the way one wishes to be perceived. In three studies, I demonstrate that
   people report they are cynical in order to avoid giving the impression
   they do not know much about politics. Political cynicism is not a
   ``socially desirable{''} characteristic-people do not believe cynicism
   is normatively good. At the same time, many see value to cynicism in
   politics, a finding which carries broad implications for the
   relationship between cynicism and perceived knowledge in political
   discourse.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) as a potential
   tool for EU public diplomacy. Institutionally, the ESC, a pan-European
   international mega-event that forms images of Europe, is not related to
   the EU. Yet, given the strong link between the ESC and the notion of
   Europe, the article suggests that the ESC might have unintentionally
   become a public diplomacy tool for the EU. This argument is supported by
   showing how public views of the EU in a nonmember country, Israel,
   changed following its hosting of the ESC in 2019. A longitudinal survey
   was used to examine the impact of the ESC on Israelis' sympathy for the
   EU six months before the 2019 ESC and immediately after hosting the
   contest. The findings indicated that watching the ESC final increased
   sympathy for the EU. This demonstrates the positive influence of
   exposure to the ESC on the views of the EU, highlighting the potential
   role of the ESC as a tool of public diplomacy for the EU. The findings
   also illustrate a broader potential for understanding public diplomacy
   consequences from real-life events.},

Title = {Normal Mode Copulas for Nonmonotonic Dependence},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 13},
Abstract = {Copulas are helpful in studying joint distributions of two variables, in
   particular, when confounders are unobserved. However, most conventional
   copulas cannot model joint distributions where one variable does not
   increase or decrease in the other in a monotonic manner. For instance,
   suppose that two variables are linearly positively correlated for one
   type of unit and negatively for another type of unit. If the type is
   unobserved, we can observe only a mixture of both types. Seemingly, one
   variable tends to take either a high or low value (or a middle value)
   when the other variable is small (large), or vice versa. To address this
   issue, I consider an overlooked copula with trigonometric functions
   (Chesneau {[}2021, Applied Mathematics, 1(1), pp. 3-17]) that I name the
   ``normal mode copula.{''} I apply the copula to a dataset about
   government formation and duration to demonstrate that the normal mode
   copula has better performance than other conventional copulas.},

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Pages = {129-151},
Abstract = {In 2021, environmental procedural rights were strengthened in Latin
   America and the Caribbean when the legally binding Escazu Agreement came
   into force. This new treaty seeks to implement Principle 10 of the 1992
   Rio Declaration, which promotes access to information, participation,
   and justice in environmental matters. The treaty is empirically and
   theoretically surprising: it bucks the growing trend of informalization
   in regional and international cooperation and is more highly legalized
   than institutional design theory would predict. Applying an
   interpretivist logic of inquiry and drawing on interviews with
   twenty-three participants in the negotiations, I argue that this outcome
   can be explained by an alignment of structural conditions that
   facilitated an alliance between ambitious state and nonstate actors and
   enabled their influence throughout negotiations. Applying theories of
   political opportunities and mobilization structures, I show how a
   network created by the World Resources Institute influenced the
   agreement's design and helped secure a high degree of obligation and
   precision in Latin America's first environmental treaty.},

Title = {Shifting paradigms: Social protection vs. social policy in Lebanon},
Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 28},
Abstract = {The multiple crises that have plagued Lebanon since 2019 have created an
   unprecedented socio-political and economic landscape that continues to
   challenge the country, its citizens, and residents. The increased
   poverty and vulnerability revived an already ongoing debate on social
   policies and security. However, the presence of international
   stakeholders, has shifted the framework of the debate from social policy
   and security to social protection. This shift in the discourse mirrors
   the current situation in the country, in which social protection
   programmes promoted and funded by international actors have become more
   prevalent. Despite the ongoing debate concerning the necessity of a
   social policy framework in Lebanon, no recent academic studies have
   explored the transition from a social policy and security system
   implemented by the government and endorsed by experts and academics to a
   social protection system advocated by international actors and donors.
   This article examines the existing social protection model and how this
   paradigm undermines the development of an overarching social policy and
   security framework in Lebanon. Drawing on a qualitative methodology,
   this study questions the international community's role in impelling a
   social protection paradigm, and argues that foreign interference can
   create dependency on donor-oriented assistance programmes that undermine
   national social policy framework and exempt governments from their
   responsibility towards citizens.},

Title = {The Role of Collector-Drainage Water in Sustainable Irrigation for
   Agriculture in the Developing World: An Experimental Study},
Journal = {WORLD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},

Month = {DEC 24},
Abstract = {This study investigates the feasibility of using mineralized
   collector-drainage water (CDW) for irrigating maize crops on light gray
   soils in the Syrdarya region of Uzbekistan, an area facing severe water
   scarcity and soil salinity challenges. The research is particularly
   novel as it explores maize production in marginalized soils, a subject
   previously unexamined in this context. The experiment was designed as a
   three-factor factorial study with three replications, following the
   guidelines of the Uzbekistan Cotton Scientific Research Institute. Five
   irrigation treatments (Fresh Water, Fresh Water 70\% vs. CDW 30\%,
   Complex Method (Mixing with Specific Rules), CDW 70\% vs. Fresh Water
   30\% (Mixing) and only CDW) were evaluated using an Alternate Furrow
   Irrigation system, incorporating various mixtures of fresh water and CDW
   to determine their effects on soil salinity, crop health and yield. The
   amount of irrigation water required was determined using a soil moisture
   balance model, with soil samples collected at multiple depths (0-100 cm)
   to monitor changes in moisture content and salinity. Salinity levels and
   soil health parameters such as alkalinity, chloride, sulfate and
   cation/anion balances were measured at different stages of crop growth.
   Data were collected over three growing seasons (3 years). An analysis of
   the data revealed that using CDW, even in mixtures with fresh water, can
   sustain crop production while managing soil salinity. Notably,
   irrigation methods such as Mixing 70-30 and the Complex Mixing Method
   effectively reduced freshwater dependency and maintained the crop yield
   without significantly increasing salinity. The results suggest that CDW
   could be a viable alternative water source in regions where traditional
   water resources are limited. The findings have significant implications
   for improving water use efficiency and agricultural productivity in
   areas facing similar environmental challenges. This research not only
   contributes to the broader understanding of sustainable irrigation
   practices in arid regions but also provides a scientific basis for the
   wider adoption of CDW in Uzbekistan, potentially enhancing food security
   and supporting long-term agricultural sustainability in the region.},

Abstract = {What drives China's approach to disputes in the South China Sea? While
   conventional wisdom often attributes Beijing's actions primarily to
   material interests, this overlooks the possible influence of
   non-material factors such as China's desire to uphold its national
   reputation. Contrary to the assumptions of traditional prospect theory,
   China's behavior is not driven solely by calculations of gains and
   losses but also by considerations for its international reputation.
   Beijing may temper its assertiveness when its reputation is declining
   but still manageable, as demonstrated by its increased willingness to
   resolve disputes multilaterally after its global image was tarnished
   following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrarily, China may
   resort to more assertive actions when these do not significantly hurt
   its reputation or when the damage seems irreversible, as seen in its
   unwavering stance during the 2012 Scarborough Shoal standoff with the
   Philippines.},

Title = {Is transparency furthering clarity in multilateral climate governance?
   The case of climate finance},

Abstract = {Developing countries' ambitious climate action hinges on the provision
   of climate finance from developed countries. Yet, despite decades of
   debate and contestation over this, substantial controversies continue to
   persist over whether and how much climate finance is flowing, including
   whether it is `new and additional' to existing development assistance,
   whether it targets climate mitigation or adaptation, and whether it is
   delivered as grants or loans. In this article, we draw on a
   little-examined source of self-reporting by countries to shed light on
   these persisting climate finance controversies. Elaborate transparency
   arrangements have been set up under the United Nations Framework
   Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), whereby countries report on
   climate finance provided and received. We examine transparency reports
   submitted by 26 countries from 2014 to 2021 by both developed and
   developing countries, and international review of these reports, to
   ascertain the extent to which country self-reporting under the UNFCCC
   sheds light on the nature of climate finance flows between developed and
   developing countries. We find that both the reports submitted and the
   international review of these reports are not furthering clarity around
   climate finance provided and received. This is because of (a) a
   persisting lack of multilaterally agreed definitions of key aspects of
   climate finance provided, and a resulting heterogeneity of definitions
   used by countries to self-report; and (b) because international review
   of country self-reporting is subject to politically negotiated
   limitations. We conclude that clarity remains elusive on climate finance
   provided and received under the UNFCCC, a situation that seems likely to
   continue under the Paris Agreement's enhanced transparency framework,
   due to be implemented in 2024.},

Abstract = {This article explores the significance of fun and solidarity in
   constructing national belonging. Drawing inspiration from Erving
   Goffman's analysis of social occasions, the article examines the
   establishment of an Irish-American Gaelic Athletic League in New York
   City from 1904 to 1916. Tracing the gradual shaping of the games, it
   shows how organizers used sporting competitions to draw participants and
   regulate the interactions between immigrants from different counties in
   Ireland. Successful regulation of the games allowed immigrants from
   various counties in Ireland to engage each other in a spirit of friendly
   competition and develop solidarity. Far from being an obstacle to
   national belonging, these differences became the basis for fun
   sociability, leading to broad Irish belonging and pride. The enjoyment
   derived from participation in well-regulated occasions contributes to
   the formation of social bonds and solidarity among potential members,
   ultimately fostering national identification.},

   longitudinal analysis (1999-2021)},
Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 3},
Abstract = {British and Scottish politics are undergoing a period of tumultuous
   change, leading to what some scholars have labelled `electoral shocks',
   which have altered the relative importance of the main issues explaining
   citizens' political behaviour. The conventional wisdom now posits that
   attitudes towards Scottish independence play an increasing role in
   structuring citizens' vote choice in Scotland. However, a longitudinal
   assessment of this claim is lacking. In this research, we seek to fill
   this gap by making use of data from 1999 to 2021, which covers every
   Scottish election since devolution, and providing the first-ever
   systematic assessment of the strength of attitudes towards Scottish
   independence in explaining electoral behaviour over time. Our findings
   reveal a substantial increase in the importance of attitudes towards
   independence, which we can quantify throughout the 1999-2021 period. We
   conclude by discussing the implications of this for British and Scottish
   politics.},

Abstract = {Is anti-far-right grassroots mobilization effective? Scholars studying
   the far right have focused extensively on the causes and consequences of
   far-right success but have paid little attention to what citizens and
   civil society can do to tackle this phenomenon. Focusing on the surge of
   Sardine (the Sardines), an anti-far-right social movement, during the
   2020 Italian regional elections, we test whether grassroots mobilization
   is an effective tool to curb far-right parties' electoral performance.
   Employing municipality-level data on electoral results, Sardines
   rallies, and far-right events, we exploit a difference-in-differences
   design to identify the effect of local exposure to Sardine mobilization
   on the municipal electoral performance of far-right parties. The results
   suggest that local exposure to a Sardines event has a strong negative
   effect on far-right electoral results.},

Title = {Reducing Racial Asymmetries in the Survey Overestimation of Voter
   Turnout},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {88},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1017-1031},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Research has consistently demonstrated that Black respondents are more
   likely than their White counterparts to overstate their plans or
   previous decisions to vote. We propose that by using a single question
   regarding turnout intention and candidate preference (rather than the
   typical approach of using two separate questions), survey researchers
   can reduce these racial asymmetries. The reason, we suggest, is that
   doing so encourages Black respondents to consider the turnout question
   through the lens of candidates and parties, rather than as a civic
   responsibility they have toward other Black Americans, which therefore
   mitigates the social desirability bias that leads to overestimation. We
   evaluate this argument using a survey experiment that randomly asks a
   control group of survey respondents to answer two voting questions-one
   about turnout and one about vote choice-and asks the other half of the
   sample, the treatment group, a single question that combines the two.
   Using original data from a nationally representative survey, we find
   that using the single turnout/preference question reduces the racial
   asymmetry in turnout overestimation substantially. We further observe
   that the decrease is concentrated among respondents with relatively high
   levels of campaign indifference and especially racial civic
   consciousness, a condition that is much more common among Black
   respondents than among White respondents. We believe these findings are
   particularly relevant to election scholars and campaign professionals,
   given their focus on understanding the thought processes of survey
   respondents and prospective voters, as well as improving the validity of
   self-reports in survey research.},

Title = {It's Not Just Trump: Americans of Both Parties Support Liberal
   Democratic Norm Violations More Under Their Own President},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 23},
Abstract = {There is a growing worry about the health of American democracy, and
   political scientists and pundits alike are looking for possible
   explanations. Surveys conducted during the Trump presidency showed
   considerable citizen support for liberal democratic norm erosions,
   especially among Republicans. However, recent experimental research also
   shows that voters of both parties are more tolerant of norm erosion
   committed by politicians of the party they prefer. In this note, we aim
   to reconcile these contradictory findings by analyzing surveys spanning
   from 2006 to 2021 on the public's tolerance of executive concentration
   of power. We also collect original data under both the Trump and Biden
   administrations gauging support for a broad array of liberal democratic
   norm erosions. Support for such erosions, in fact, has been relatively
   similar across Democrats and Republicans once we account for the party
   of the president. Support for executive aggrandizement has been
   prevalent among supporters of the president's party at least since the
   second term of the Bush administration. Increased checks and balances on
   the executive, through divided government, amplifies this effect
   further. Taken together, these findings suggest that universal support
   for the liberal democratic status quo has been weaker among those who
   support the president's party, well before and since the Trump
   presidency.},

Abstract = {During the last decades, political distrust has seemingly become a
   common trend across Latin American democracies, however, differences in
   the levels of confidence among groups have also been identified. This
   article considers the potential effects of ethno-racial structures and
   their interactions with other forms of socioeconomic inequalities on
   political trust. Building on data from four waves of the Latinobarometer
   project and contextual measures from different sources, we analyze these
   relations and find that both socioeconomic and ethno-racial inequalities
   affect political trust and impact on the formation of different
   relations with the political system across Latin America. Furthermore,
   in particular it is found that at the individual-level interactions
   between inequalities shape political trust differently depending on the
   particular ethno-racial identification. These findings contribute to the
   understanding of ethnicity and race and its associations with other
   structural inequalities in shaping mass political culture.},

Abstract = {The Human Development Index is a useful measure of a country's overall
   prosperity and standard of living (HDI). The Human Development Index
   (HDI) provides data on the social and economic progress of a nation by
   accounting for variables such as life expectancy, education attainment,
   and per capita income. This research delves into the intricate
   correlation of a nation's historical background, policy framework, and
   advancements on the Human Development Index. The remarkable journey of
   South Africa, from apartheid to inclusive growth, is an important
   example. The study uses an average yearly growth rate to examine how
   changes in political ideologies, ongoing development initiatives, and
   historical contexts of inequality have shaped South Africa's HDI
   trajectory. By examining crucial turning points and policy influences,
   the study aims to reveal the complex relationship of factors affecting
   human development results. Despite improvement, challenges like
   unemployment and poverty continue. The study stresses the relevance of
   understanding historical context and policy changes in shaping HDI
   outcomes. Ultimately, the study emphasises the need of maintaining a
   long-term commitment to effective and inclusive human development
   policies. Understanding the complex relationship of factors influencing
   South Africa's HDI will help policymakers make better informed decisions
   that will lead to a more prosperous and fair society for all South
   Africans.},

Abstract = {The international forest regime-if there ever was such a
   thing-traditionally developed on the fringes of various environmental
   treaty regimes. In recent years, however, the regime's boundaries have
   conquered new, historically hostile territories. The last two decades
   have indeed witnessed the emergence, and then proliferation, of a new
   generation of free trade agreements that incorporate commitments
   pertaining to forests. These commitments have developed along two lines:
   either through the establishment of linkages to pre-existing
   forest-related obligations enshrined in multilateral environmental
   agreements or through the creation of new forest commitments. To the
   extent that such trade-forest commitments have now become part and
   parcel of the international law governing forests, their existence
   raises important policy choice questions that have not been addressed
   yet. This article aims to fill this gap by answering the following
   question: should we, for the sake of the protection of our forests,
   welcome such a development or, on the contrary, oppose it? Using a
   legal-dogmatic approach, this article provides, based on a cross-study
   analysis of a selection of trade agreements including forest-related
   provisions, a doctrinal evaluation of the fitness of these commitments
   to achieve forest protection and identifies the opportunities and risks
   associated therewith. In so doing, this article debates the adequacy of
   international trade law for regulating forests.},

Title = {Green nationalism from above: Authoritarian state power and the greening
   of UAE nationalism},
Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 1},
Abstract = {All nationalisms have multiple storylines that evolve in response to
   changes in global affairs. The shifting geopolitical and ecological
   circumstances surrounding climate change are contributing to the
   strengthening of ``green nationalisms{''} around the world - including
   in authoritarian states. This article examines the rise of green
   nationalism in the UAE, where state-led discourse has tapped into
   sustainability tropes to reframe the country's national identity and
   values as ``green.{''} Building from over 5 years of qualitative
   research on the UAE's sustainability agenda, it examines the evolution
   of state-led green nationalist storylines through institutional, policy,
   and events landscapes in the years leading up to and including the
   United Nations COP28 climate talks in Dubai in December 2023. Emirati
   political elites, I argue, mobilise green nationalism to cultivate
   symbolic capital domestically and internationally and, in so doing,
   legitimate their authoritarian hold on state power. The greening of
   nationalisms requires much closer scrutiny around the world - and
   especially when promoted by authoritarian leaders who are more motivated
   by regime durability rather than joining the global community for urgent
   climate action.},

Abstract = {Political economy explanations of regime resilience often look at
   domestic support bases and patronage systems. Foreign aid to the state
   is seen as a direct form of propping up regimes. This article attempts
   to track the flow of foreign assistance to one part of the domestic
   support base of a regime, namely the economic elite, thereby making a
   connection between domestic explanations and foreign support
   explanations of regime resilience. The core argument of this article is
   that multilateral financial flows from Western dominated institutions
   may preserve regimes in the Middle East and North Africa. Multilateral
   flows from the World Bank Group, the European Investment Bank, and the
   European Bank for Reconstruction and Development went to regime insiders
   and thus potentially strengthened existing economic elites during the
   time in which the former Islamist opposition party led a coalition
   government. I draw on the linkage dimension of Levitsky and Way's model
   to show the importance of specifying the nature and destination of
   multilateral financial ties with Morocco's private sector. This
   contribution helps us link the international dimension to the domestic
   political economy. It thus potentially adds to our understanding of
   monarchical regime resilience post-Arab Spring by highlighting how
   multilateral financial institutions support an important part of the
   economic elite.},

Abstract = {Electoral misinformation, where citizens believe false or misleading
   claims about the electoral process and electoral institutions-sometimes
   actively and strategically spread by political actors-is a challenge to
   public confidence in elections specifically and democracy more broadly.
   In this article, we analyze a combination of 42 million clicks in links
   and apps from behavioral tracking data of 2,200 internet users and a
   four-wave panel survey to investigate how different kinds of online news
   and media use relate to beliefs in electoral misinformation during a
   contentious political period-the 2022 Brazilian presidential elections.
   We find that, controlling for other factors, using news from legacy news
   media is associated with belief in fewer claims of electoral
   misinformation over time. We find null or inconsistent effects for using
   digital-born news media and various digital platforms, including
   Facebook and WhatsApp. Furthermore, we find that trust in news plays a
   significant role as a moderator. Belief in electoral misinformation, in
   turn, undermines trust in news. Overall, our findings document the
   important role of the news media as an institution in curbing electoral
   misinformation, even as they also underline the precarity of trust in
   news during contentious political periods.},

Abstract = {Do Donald Trump's attacks on voting by mail influence how some Canadians
   view mail-in ballots? The Trump effect on views and behaviors
   surrounding voting by mail has been well documented in the United
   States. North of the border, more Canadians than ever voted by mail in
   the last general election. In this study, we consider how right-wing
   populism is associated with trust in voting by mail among Canadians.
   Specifically, we seek to test two main hypotheses. First, we consider
   whether Canadians holding populist views-and, in particular, those
   holding right-wing populist views (would-be Trump supporters)-are less
   trusting of voting by mail. Second, we consider whether political media
   exposure amplifies this association. We analyze data from both the 2021
   Canadian Election Study and Democracy Checkup Survey. We find that those
   who hold populist views clearly have less trust in voting by mail. This
   is especially true among right-leaning individuals. Furthermore, as in
   the United States, this effect is moderated by one's level of political
   media exposure, with higher levels of political media exposure
   amplifying the effect of populist views on trust in voting by mail. Our
   findings, therefore, suggest that the politicization of mail-in voting
   by President Trump has important implications for the legitimacy of the
   electoral system not only in the United States, but also in Canada and
   potentially in other parts of the world.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the dynamic relationship between electoral
   manipulation and popular trust in political institutions. Governments
   often manipulate election results by resorting to electoral fraud. They
   also tilt the electoral field by opportunistically deciding when to hold
   elections, in other words, election timing maneuvering. How do these two
   different types of electoral manipulation affect citizens' trust in the
   government, legislature, and election management bodies (EMBs)? We
   suggest that although the short-term effects of election timing
   manipulation are unclear due to its ambiguous nature as an
   electioneering strategy, substantial electoral margins created by timing
   maneuvering facilitate smooth decision-making, leading to boosting trust
   in the government and legislature over the long run. In contrast, as
   electoral fraud is an unambiguous form of manipulation, it may undermine
   trust in the government and parliament, although such effects may not
   last. By combining an original dataset of election timing with existing
   survey data comprising 335,000 citizens from fifty-eight democratic
   countries, we find evidence in support of our theoretical expectations.},

Abstract = {Patterns of social networks in plurinational societies remain
   understudied in the inter-group contact literature. In Canada, a
   significant number of authors have studied political divides between
   Quebecers and other Canadians, but little is still known about the scope
   and determinants of the social disconnect between both communities. This
   paper provides the first quantitative measure of the social networking
   gap between Canada's `two solitudes' using behavioural data. Our
   analysis mobilises the Facebook Connectedness Index (2020), which
   provides district-level connectivity estimates between all active
   Facebook users in Canada. Results obtained via linear regression models
   show that population size, distance and self-isolation patterns cannot
   account for the significant connectivity gap between Quebec and the rest
   of Canada. However, bilingualism in Quebec is positively correlated with
   higher inter-regional networks, suggesting asymmetrical linguistic
   exchanges. These results empirically confirm decades of anecdotal
   accounts about the existence of a social disconnect between Canada's
   French- and English-speaking communities.},

Abstract = {International regimes, defined as sets of norms and rules around which
   members' expectations converge, are providing structures for
   facilitating cooperation in a given issue area. Two main lines of
   environmental regime scholarship prevailed thus far: one on structural
   design aspects of international institutions and one on their effects
   and effectiveness. However, questions on how such effects are achieved
   in detail largely remain unanswered. Against this background, this study
   aims to analyze the institutional design conditions under which regional
   regimes produce strong or weak policies. We do so by qualitatively
   comparing, using a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA),
   nine regional regimes across the world towards their ability of
   producing regime forest policies as an illustrative issue area. Three
   structural conditions were identified as being influential on regime
   policy: (i) The degree of formalization (ii) The existence of
   hegemonic/powerful member state(s) and (iii) Scope or issue specificity
   bearing the identity of a regime. Our results showed that no one
   condition on its own was necessary to produce either strong or weak
   regime forest policy. However, all three conditions, through three
   different configurations, created a robust pathway for producing strong
   regime policy. In addition, the combination that showed the presence of
   all three conditions was related to weak regime policy. These results
   open several prospects for future research on the relationship between
   regimes<acute accent> structures and regime policy.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine how young climate activists make use of the
   United Nations (UN) constituency system to give voice to children and
   youth in global climate governance. Our study is based on a mapping of
   accredited youth nongovernmental organizations (YOUNGO) as well as
   fieldwork at two UN Climate Change Conferences, where we conducted
   interviews, observed events, and analyzed plenary interventions.
   Informed by constructivist accounts of political representation, the
   article pays attention to the performative relationship between
   institutionalized means of youth representation and ``the
   represented.{''} When analyzing our material, we asked who speaks for
   youth, how youth are spoken of, and how institutions shape
   representative speech. Our study identifies three subject positions that
   offer competing interpretations of who youth are as a political
   community and what they want. Rather than taking youth's demands and
   interests as a starting point for representative politics, the article
   illustrates how the UN constituency system actively constructs youth and
   effectively molds young climate activists into professional insiders.},

Abstract = {The European Union employs the largest number of interpreters globally,
   surpassing even the United Nations. This analysis delves into the
   interpreted world of international politics and works towards
   appreciating sonic politics in conference and diplomatic interpretation.
   Drawing on testimonies of Portuguese interpreters of the European Union,
   the present paper examines the everyday practicality of institutional
   operations, what happens on the ground and what constitutes everyday
   diplomatic life - in other words, in other voices - so as to locate new
   sites of political activation, meaningful enactment of power and
   ideological encounters. The research shows that interpreters supply
   affective foundation to multilingual negotiations and that their emotive
   rendition gives form to inter-state understanding. The research explains
   how interpretation is politics emerging from visual and audible
   performance of the interpreters.},

Abstract = {Research suggests that economic inequality reduces political trust after
   the public recognizes the inequality and perceives it as a failure of
   the political system in Western democracies. This study challenges this
   presumed ``output evaluation model{''} (OEM) both theoretically and
   empirically. We provide an alternative mediator evaluation model (MEM)
   contending that objective inequality affects political trust through
   government-performance mediators, without requiring accurate public
   perception of inequality or specific regime types. With nationwide
   economic inequality and public opinion data from China, we examined both
   the OEM implication and four MEM mechanisms through impartial
   governance, responsiveness, judicial fairness, and anti-corruption
   efforts. Findings indicate that the mediating mechanisms, rather than
   direct inequality, shape political trust, with robust evidence even
   after addressing endogeneity. This study broadens the understanding of
   the intricate relationship between systemic conditions and individual
   perceptions, offering significant insights into the dynamics of trust in
   political institutions in a general sense.},

Abstract = {The ideational definition of populism proposes that a narrative is
   populist if it is characterized by a Manichean cosmology that divides
   the political community between a ``people,{''} conceived as a
   homogeneously virtuous entity, and an ``elite,{''} conceived as a
   homogeneously corrupt entity. Departing from that conceptualization,
   this work first investigates the specific stories that Andres Manuel
   Lopez Obrador uses to spread his populist worldview, which we call
   ``storytelling.{''} We define the idea of storytelling as the art of
   telling a story where emotions, characters and other details are applied
   in order to promote a particular point of view or set of values. Second,
   we explore whether some of those stories produce greater negative
   affective polarization, here defined as the extent to which rival
   sociopolitical camps view each other as a disliked out-group. Findings
   suggest that some specific stories-in particular, what we call ``stories
   of conspiracy{''} and ``stories of ostracism{''}-indeed tend to induce
   more polarized attitudes among citizens.},

Abstract = {The Black Lives Matter movement focused scholarly and public attention
   on the politics of policing, but little is known about long-term trends
   in public opinion toward the police. I analyze three time series of
   attitudes toward police and police spending dating back as far as the
   1960s: Gallup's confidence in police question, the American National
   Election Studies' feeling thermometer toward police, and the General
   Social Survey's support for law enforcement spending question. The
   general public has become less positive toward police, and racial and
   partisan gaps have increased, in all three series. Partisan gaps are
   generally larger than racial gaps, and differences between white and
   Black Democrats have evolved in important ways. Divides on confidence
   and affect are more longstanding than divides on support for spending.},

   nationalists on Vkontakte},
Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {361-377},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The article explores the specifics of Russian antisemitic discourse of
   recent years using the example of three nationalist communities on
   Vkontakte, the most popular Russian social networking site, by means of
   critical discourse analysis. The main strategies they employ to frame
   the Jews online are stereotyping Jews as ungrateful and greedy,
   labelling the liberal opposition as Jews and using conspiracy narratives
   of Jews controlling the elites. The war in Ukraine has added nuances:
   Jews are accused of helping Ukraine, undermining the Russian political
   system and orchestrating the conflict. A situation of socio-political
   turmoil transforms the perceived threat presented by Jews in
   `pro-regime' nationalist discourse from symbolic (identitarian) to
   realistic (economic and political) by providing underpinnings for the
   traditional fears. For nationalist communities based on the ethnic and
   racial understanding of a nation, this transformation is less present
   because they originally perceived Jews as a realistic threat. Though
   sociologically, Russian antisemitism has been in stable decline offline
   in recent decades, it is more visible online because of social media's
   apparent anonymity and content generation affordances.},

Abstract = {Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the frictions in the
   EU-China relations, India has acquired an apical position in the
   European foreign policy agenda. Since 2001, the Jean Monnet action has
   been transformed into a global instrument of EU public diplomacy. This
   study aims to provide a preliminary assessment of the Jean Monnet action
   in India. The objective is to identify the activities financed, the
   geographical distribution and the measures adopted by the European
   institutional actors to capitalize on the funds invested in Indian
   academia. The analysis is conducted by combining quantitative and
   qualitative approaches. The final goal is to provide an overview of the
   Jean Monnet implementation in India and to detect strategies that the
   European policymakers could adopt to enhance the effectiveness of the
   action in strengthening EU awareness in Indian society.},

Title = {``I Would Prefer Not To{''}: Establishing the Missing Link between
   Invalid Voting and Public Protest in Latin America},
Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {66},

Abstract = {While invalid voting is often treated as protest behavior in an
   electoral context, its association with actual political protests has
   not yet been empirically demonstrated. The relative scarcity of research
   on the topic is likely due to the hybrid nature of invalid voting as a
   both formal and informal political gesture. The novel availability of
   event-based data for public protests in Latin America allows for testing
   whether their occurrence is connected with changes in spoiled and blank
   ballots. Using an appropriate dynamic regression model covering
   variations in the 148 intervals between Latin American legislative
   elections in the 1979-2021 period, this study finds a strong connection
   between the emergence of antigovernment protests and surges in invalid
   voting (and vice versa). This relationship still holds at parity of
   economic conditions and it is reinforced by a lack of alternation in the
   party of power. Conversely, the appearance of workers' strikes appears
   to work as a substitute for this behavior, which is also chosen by
   voters when democracy deteriorates, while corruption has no independent
   impact on invalid voting. Overall this work's findings promise to send
   the research agenda on invalid voting in a new direction, previously
   unexplored because of an absence of fitting data.},

Abstract = {Popular support is important to the emergence and survival of democracy.
   In this paper, we study how church-state relations in former British
   Africa shaped long-run support for democracy. We argue that shared
   national identity was the basis for incentive alignment, facilitating
   cooperation over educational policy between church and state and
   engendering long-run support for democracy. Employing geospatial
   analyses of historical mission data and contemporary social survey data
   from 19 former British African colonies, we find that areas with
   missions originating from Britain exhibit better educational outcomes
   and greater support for democracy than areas that had non-British
   missions. Furthermore, areas with British Protestant missions show
   greater support for democracy than British Catholic missions, suggesting
   that Protestantism supplements the benefits of shared nationhood between
   mission and state. Our findings add nuance to scholarship on the
   colonial origins of democracy by highlighting the interdependent
   legacies of church and state.},

Abstract = {Environmental degradation driven by human activities has heightened the
   need for sustainable development strategies that balance economic growth
   with ecological preservation. This study uses a compartmental model
   approach to examine the effects of global warming on ecosystem dynamics,
   focusing on how rising temperatures alter interactions across trophic
   levels. Three case studies of varying complexity, including a human
   ecosystem incorporating social and economic factors, were analyzed by
   integrating feedback loops between greenhouse gas emissions, temperature
   anomalies, and ecosystem responses. The results quantitatively
   demonstrate that even minor disruptions in one part of an ecosystem can
   cause significant instability across trophic levels, potentially driving
   the system to collapse in a short period. These findings from all case
   studies highlight the cascading impacts of global warming, underscoring
   the intricate relationship between climate change and ecosystem
   stability. Furthermore, this study offers qualitative insights into the
   potential consequences of climate change on biodiversity and resource
   availability in real ecosystems, highlighting the vulnerability of such
   systems and the importance of incorporating feedback mechanisms into
   environmental policy and decision-making processes. The approach
   employed in this study offers a more robust framework for understanding
   ecosystem responses and for developing strategies to enhance resilience
   against climate change, thereby protecting the long-term sustainability
   of ecosystems.},

Abstract = {By providing an overview of the rich and surprising ways in which the
   victims' shoes trope becomes utilised in political protests as the focus
   of interaction ritual chains, this article elaborates on the three
   distinct ways through which moral communities of solidarity position
   themselves. Firstly, moral communities are often formed around aspects
   of large-scale atrocities such as commemoration, victimhood and past
   injustices that, I argue, strengthen nationalist sentiments. The second
   type of moral communities of solidarity are those that demand `rights'
   and claim `duties' for promoting particular sectoral agendas. In the
   third type, the shoes serve to build solidarities that are
   future-oriented and aim at promoting universal human rights. By using
   Goffman's Frame Theory and Collins' Interaction Ritual Chain Theory,
   this article analyses protests from around the world in which the
   victims' shoes trope has been utilised to tackle a wide range of
   subjects-gun and domestic violence, unemployment, Covid-19 policies,
   institutional abuse, road safety, commemorations, antiwar and climate
   protests and more.},

Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {88},
Number = {3},
Pages = {962-990},
Month = {OCT 23},
Abstract = {Studies based on digital trace data show that older Americans visit and
   share dubious news sources far more often than younger cohorts,
   tendencies often attributed to lower levels of digital literacy. At the
   same time, survey experiments show that older Americans are no worse, if
   not better, at discerning between false and accurate news. If older
   Americans can identify misleading news content equally well, why are
   they still more likely to engage with it in observational settings? In
   this article, we combine survey measures and digital trace data for
   three nationally representative samples (N=9,944) to argue that the
   existing literature overemphasizes the importance of factors like
   digital literacy relative to standard political variables such as
   political interest and partisanship, factors known to increase across
   the lifespan. Calcified partisanship in particular makes older Americans
   vulnerable to hyperpartisan news-which is highly slanted but not
   verified as explicitly false. High rates of engagement with this
   category of content, which has been examined in survey studies of older
   citizens less regularly in the literature, may partially explain the
   high rates of engagement with dubious news domains in behavioral trace
   data. In all, our findings have important implications for how we
   understand-and might intervene to reduce-high engagement among this
   cohort with dubious news.},

   national solidarity},
Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-46},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This study distinguishes between two performances of solidarity-a
   performer-audience structure and a network structure-illustrated through
   a review of two case studies from the field of sport: a cross-national
   survey of football fans and a historical study of French cycling clubs.
   Research on nationhood, sport and performance has centred mainly on
   public events and how they generate focused attention to foster mass
   solidarity. Scholars have overlooked an alternative model of performance
   situated in horizontal networks and interpersonal interactions staged in
   front of a third party, such as found in clubs. Distinguishing between
   these performance models in sport and beyond can further our
   understanding of the relations between identity and solidarity in
   studies of nationhood. Whereas in the former model, expressions of
   solidarity mainly reaffirm pre-existing feelings of national identity;
   in the latter model, solidarity is performative: it does not simply
   represent social reality but serves to create it.},

Abstract = {The Mumbai and Paris attacks are representative cases of mass-casualty
   terrorism due to the number of casualties and the level of devastation
   they caused. This type of terrorism has often been the result of
   strategic surprise resuting from intelligence failure. In both India and
   France, security agencies were taken by surprise and failed to respond
   promptly. Although the concept of strategic surprise has been largely
   explored by Western scholars, there is an Islamist perspective that has
   not received any attention. The article claims that strategic surprise
   can be understood as a cultural particular leading to mass-casualty
   terrorism. Finally, it examines the implications for intelligence and
   deterrence which need to adapt accordingly.},

Title = {China's Shift from CMI to MCF: Military Modernization and the Defense
   Industry at the Core},
Journal = {ISSUES \& STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {60},
Number = {03},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The concept of civil-military integration (CMI) was officially
   introduced in the 1990s in the United States to transform industrial
   bases in defense amidst shifting geopolitical dynamics. CMI aims to blur
   the lines between civilian and military sectors, fostering the sharing
   of resources and technological advancement. This paper looks at the
   practice of CMI in China and its shift to military-civil fusion (MCF).
   Though the concept only emerged in the late 20th century, CMI in its
   other forms such as defense conversion and diversification has been
   practiced in China since the Mao era. However, the transition from CMI
   to MCF underscores the evolution of China's strategic priorities,
   aligning military and civilian resources for technological advancement
   and national rejuvenation. Under Xi Jinping's leadership, China has
   elevated MCF into a national strategy. MCF is considered essential for
   achieving China's strategic goals and has entered a rapid stage of
   development, reflecting Xi's commitment to modernizing the PLA and
   advancing national rejuvenation to realize the ``Chinese Dream.{''}
   China's efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in defense production and
   assert its military prowess on the global stage propelled by the MCF
   strategy under Xi Jinping have global geopolitical implications.},

Abstract = {Public support is a critical factor in the outcome of interstate
   conflicts, yet, how it operates, interacts with hard power, or
   influences the overall military outlook remains surprisingly
   undertheorized. Public support has been particularly salient for such
   states as Finland and Ukraine that have faced opponents of vastly
   greater military size, capability, and sophistication. This paper
   advances an original theory on the strategic utility of public support
   for conflict through an analysis of the case of Taiwan, a potential
   current flashpoint for a great power war. This paper assesses trends in
   Taiwanese public support for resisting a Chinese invasion over time,
   identifies a major upswing in the public's willingness to fight, and
   argues that further coordination by state and societal actors could
   deter a Chinese attack or at least greatly increase the costs of an
   invasion and the likelihood of failure.},

   (2011-2021)},
Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 23},
Abstract = {In 2021, President Bashar al-Assad ordered the most significant reform
   of religious institutions in Syria's modern history by abolishing the
   position of Grand Mufti and replacing it with a collegial body. Whereas
   most observers interpreted this move as a means to further subdue the
   Sunni religious elites, I argue that in fact, Assad's decision addressed
   an old demand of the conservative Sunni ulama. For decades, the latter
   had asked for a collegial religious authority to be entrusted with the
   protection of `correct' Islam not only from extremist ideas but also
   from modernist interpretations like those propagated by the last Grand
   Mufti himself. Getting rid of such `enlightened' figures was all the
   more urgent, for the conservatives, that wartime circumstances had
   provided their rivals with new allies among paramilitary forces and
   pro-regime minority constituencies. In that context, `moderate Islam'
   had become the focus of competing definitions by conservatives, who
   equated it with traditional Sunni doctrines, and modernists, who
   advocated innovative interpretations of the Scriptures and further
   secularization of law and education.},

Abstract = {The state of Penang, including city councils for island Pulau Pinang
   (with urban-core George Town) and mainland Seberang Perai, has
   negotiated at least a degree of political marginalisation since
   independence. Ruled previously by a secondary partner in the ruling
   Barisan Nasional (National Front), and since 2008, by the Democratic
   Action Party and its coalition partners, the economically powerful state
   has negotiated constrained autonomy and resources. While to some extent,
   these governing challenges are common to all states in Malaysia's highly
   centralised federation, in other ways, they reflect Penang's specific
   political position. Penang's leadership has sought in particular ways to
   circumvent inertia or divided loyalties among bureaucrats from the
   federal, rather than a state-level, civil service. Central to that
   solution has been reliance on an array of state government-linked
   corporations, facilitating administration, but at possible cost to clear
   accountability, transparency, and promised empowerment of civil society.},

Abstract = {This article explores de facto displacement and negative emplacement
   dynamics in the borderlands of the de facto state of Abkhazia. The
   uncertain status of de facto states creates a vulnerable,
   disenfranchised and rearranged post-conflict environment for ethnic
   minorities that are deemed unwanted remnants of the conflict. I make two
   arguments: First, de facto displacement is a situation of displacement
   where the displaced do not physically move away but where the landscape
   around them together with the sociopolitical situation significantly
   changes almost overnight. Second, that this displacement comes with
   negative emplacement in which a person and/or group is negatively set in
   place in a physical and social sense within the newly created reality of
   the de facto state.},

Title = {Threats to Liberalism in a Nascent Democracy: Authoritarian
   Encroachment, a Security Dilemma, and a Political-Cultural Deficit},

Abstract = {This article offers a complimentary analysis to Prof. Thompson's
   treatise on democracy in East Asia. It focuses on the external source of
   democratic backsliding, a look into the future, and an emphasis on the
   dilemma of meeting the security challenge while remaining liberal in a
   world rapidly plunging into Cold War 2.0. Three sources of threat to
   nascent liberal democracies are identified: authoritarian encroachment,
   a security dilemma, and a political-cultural deficit. There are striking
   similarities between the response of a country to external threat and a
   human body's response to pathogens (such as SARS-CoV-2). These responses
   also have similar effects on the survival of the country and the
   infected person. In order to analyze the relation between a country's
   external environment and its polity, a historical account of how the
   perception of relative security managed to advance liberal political
   institutions and threats to national security thwarted liberalization in
   the constitutional development of the Republic of China is offered. This
   complement ends with a warning about how the world's plunge into Cold
   War 2.0 may adversely impact nascent liberal democracies in East Asia
   that bear the brunt of the rise of an authoritarian China.},

Abstract = {This article explores the way a new specifically Georgian post-Stalinist
   art form (cheduroba, metal engraving) that emerged in the 1960s became a
   commonly encountered emblematic feature of the equally new urban spaces
   of the rapidly changing modernist Tbilisi cityscape. This new, and yet
   seemingly old, art form, which frequently featured the face of a
   traditional Georgian girl, usually a Khevsur girl from the mountains,
   came to be a diagnostic part of the modern urban assemblage of Tbilisi
   in the 1960s. This traditional face from the Georgian past became a
   paradoxical figure for the alliance of art and architecture in the
   visual aesthetics of the modern Georgian city in the 1960s, and the art
   form became the stereotypical ``face{''} of a specifically Georgian
   post-Stalinist ``traditional-modernist{''} public urban art. This art
   form soon became diagnostic of modern Georgian urban spaces, like the
   Tbilisi metro, which also opened around the same time in the 1960s. The
   recurrent distribution of this face across newly-created modernist urban
   spaces together formed a Georgian version of ``socialist modernism,{''}
   producing a visually-experienced ``brand of socialism{''} for urban
   spaces, a procession of images traditional or national (in style or
   theme) in socialist modernist spaces connecting the traditional
   architecture of the city to the modernist architectural spaces of the
   new socialist city of the 1960s.},

Abstract = {Even among those who share the same partisan commitments, some people
   say they despise the opposing party while others report far less
   animosity. Why are some people more likely to express hostility toward
   the opposing political party? We explore how individual-level
   differences in feelings of self-confidence fuel out-party animosities.
   Drawing on responses to a module of the 2020 Cooperative Election Study,
   we show that higher levels of internal political efficacy are associated
   with greater affective polarization. Those who feel self-assured about
   their political abilities are more likely to admit severing social ties
   with those who disagree with them and are more tolerant of
   discrimination against partisan opponents. In a survey experiment, we
   confirm that those with greater internal efficacy are also more likely
   to accept discrimination against a member of the opposing party.
   Affective polarization is greatest among those who feel the most
   confident of their ability to influence politics.},

Abstract = {Urban vegetable farming in wetlands and riverbanks are common features
   of Ugandan cities. However, urbanization has led to various
   anthropogenic activities that can lead to the pollution of water
   resources, enrichment of pollutants in soils and, consequently,
   pollutant bioaccumulation in edible tissues of plants cultivated on such
   soils. In this study, we report on the levels of six trace metals (TMTs)
   in 75 samples of leafy vegetables (Brassica oleracea L., Spinacia
   oleracea L., Amaranthus hybridus L., Cucurbita pepo L. and Solanum
   nigrum L.) and soils (n = 75) grown on the banks of River Rwizi, the
   second longest river in Uganda only after the Nile River. The
   concentrations of TMTs (Mn, Zn, Cd, Pb, Cr and Cu) in edible vegetable
   tissues and soils were quantified using flame atomic absorption
   spectrometry. The mean concentrations (in mg kg-1) of the TMTs in the
   soil samples were 205-373.84 (Mn), 12.72-65.04 (Zn), 0.26-0.42 (Cd),
   3.36-16.80 (Pb), 5.96-25.06 (Cr) and 2.83-35.27 (Cu). In vegetable
   samples, the concentrations ranged from 43.25 to 110.00 (Mn), 1.08 to
   1.83 (Cd), 41.06 to 71.20 (Zn), 4.31 to 6.16 (Pb), 0.65 to 0.81 (Cr) and
   5.70 to 14.35 (Cu). With the exception of Mn and Cr, the rest of the
   TMTs were bioaccumulated in the edible vegetable tissues
   (bioconcentration factors = 1.03 to 10.71). Considering chronic daily
   intake through ingestion, dermal contact and inhalation of the TMTs in
   soils from the banks of River Rwizi, there are no potential non-cancer
   and carcinogenic health effects that could be experienced in both adults
   and children. Consumption of leafy vegetables could pose both non-cancer
   health risks (from ingestion of Zn, Pb, Cr, Mn and Cd) and cancer health
   risks (due to intake of Cd) in both children and adults. There is
   therefore a need to enforce regulations to mitigate the pollution of
   River Rwizi for a more sustainable economic development.},

Title = {A Regional Perspective of Socio-Ecological Predictors for Fruit and Nut
   Tree Varietal Diversity Maintained by Farmer Communities in Central Asia},

Abstract = {The five independent countries of Central Asia, namely Kazakhstan,
   Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, contain one of the
   richest areas in the world for the specific and intraspecific diversity
   of temperate fruit and nut tree species. Research was carried out via
   the collaboration of national research and education institutes with
   local community-based agencies and farmer communities. Raw data (2014
   observations) for almond, apple, apricot, cherry plum, currant,
   grapevine, pear, pomegranate, and walnut were collected at the household
   (HH) level across the five countries: Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan,
   Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan. A set of models was used,
   including household variety richness as the dependent variable, to
   understand the influence of socio-ecological variables on the amount and
   distribution of crop varietal diversity in the farmers' production
   systems. Four variables were included as explanatory variables of
   variety richness (fixed factors): ecoregion, ethno-linguistic group,
   management, and abiotic stress. The results show clear evidence that
   abiotic stress determines a higher richness of intra-specific diversity
   in the form of local varieties grown by farmers living in climatically
   unfavorable areas. The results for the studied ecoregions follow the
   same trend, with ecoregions with harsher conditions displaying a higher
   positive correlation with diversity. Mild environments such as the
   Central Asian riparian woodlands show an unexpectedly lower diversity
   than other harsher ecoregions. Ethno-linguistic groups also have an
   effect on the level of varietal diversity used, related to both historic
   nomadic practices and a culture of harvesting wild fruit and nuts in
   mountainous areas. The home garden management system hosts a higher
   diversity compared to larger production systems such as orchards. In
   Central Asia, encouraging the cultivation of local varieties of fruit
   and nut trees provides a key productive and resilient livelihood
   strategy for farmers living under the harsh environmental conditions of
   the region while providing a unique opportunity to conserve a genetic
   heritage of global importance.},

Abstract = {In the last decade, there have been numerous studies on the rise,
   characteristics, and consequences of the emergence of populist parties
   in Western liberal democracies. However, most analyses of European
   populist parties have focused on the right-wing populist parties.
   Although some scholars have made valuable efforts to understand
   left-wing populism in Europe, these studies have paid attention to their
   ideological-organizational idiosyncrasies or the characteristics of
   their electoral bases. This paper aims to fill the gap in the economic
   and political contexts in which Radical Left Populist Parties have
   achieved significant electoral results putting into practice a fsQCA
   analysis and examining their uneven electoral performance in Europe.
   Following some previous work applying QCA techniques, this paper tests
   the theory on the importance of economic and political factors. Findings
   indicate that the electoral performance of radical left populism cannot
   be explained in a univocal way, highlighting the crucial role of
   equifinality in understanding this political phenomenon.},

   Political Expression},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 27},
Abstract = {I develop a survey method for estimating social influence over
   individual political expression, by combining the content-richness of
   document scaling with the flexibility of survey research. I introduce
   the ``What Would You Say?{''} question, which measures self-reported
   usage of political catchphrases in a hypothetical social context, which
   I manipulate in a between-subjects experiment. Using Wordsticks, an
   ordinal item response theory model inspired by Wordfish, I estimate each
   respondent's lexical ideology and outspokenness, scaling their political
   lexicon in a two-dimensional space. I then identify self-censorship and
   preference falsification as causal effects of social context on
   respondents' outspokenness and lexical ideology, respectively. This
   improves upon existing survey measures of political expression: it
   avoids conflating expressive behavior with populist attitudes, it
   defines preference falsification in terms of code-switching, and it
   moves beyond trait measures of self-censorship, to characterize relative
   shifts in the content of expression between different contexts. I
   validate the method and present experiments demonstrating its
   application to contemporary concerns about self-censorship and
   polarization, and I conclude by discussing its interpretation and future
   uses.},

Abstract = {Rapid urbanization in South Asian cities has triggered significant
   changes in land use and land cover (LULC), degrading natural biophysical
   components and intensifying urban heat islands (UHIs). This study
   investigated the impact of LULC changes on land surface temperature
   (LST) and the role of biophysical indicators in enhancing urban
   resilience to thermal extremes. We used Landsat satellite imageries from
   1993 to 2023, conducted a comprehensive analysis of LULC changes, and
   estimated LST variations at 6-year intervals in the Dhaka, Gazipur, and
   Narayanganj districts in Bangladesh. Afterward, we performed statistical
   analysis upon employing correlation, regression, and principal component
   analysis (PCA) techniques to summarize information. The results reveal
   that 339.13 km2 worth of urban expansion has occurred in last 30 years,
   with an average annual growth rate of 3.5\%, accompanied by a
   substantial reduction in water bodies (-139.17 km2) and vegetation
   cover. Consequently, summer temperatures exceeded approximately 36.52
   degrees C in dense urban areas. Also, the results highlighted the strong
   influence of built-up areas (BSI and SAVI) on LST, while vegetation
   (NDVI) and water indices (NDWI) exhibited a negative association. The
   findings emphasize the urgency of integrating green infrastructure and
   deploying sustainable urban planning policies to mitigate the potential
   adverse impacts of scattered urbanization in the face of climate change.},

Abstract = {The recent authoritarian turn in Chinese politics under Xi Jinping has
   invigorated interest in the concept of ``public security,{''} a
   metamorphosis of the term ``weiwen{''} (stability maintenance) fashioned
   by his predecessor Hu Jintao. Both concepts emphasize a preventive
   repression that involves a whole-of-society approach to preserving
   social order. Drawing on an original protest dataset and the Chinese
   government statistics on public security spending, we conduct an
   empirical study of the repression-protest nexus to investigate the
   extent to which the Chinese state has been effective in preempting
   social contention. While we find correlational evidence of increased
   security spending and a decline in protests, this provides modest
   support for the strategy's effectiveness. Despite political tightening
   under Xi, we find evidence for increased frequency, larger size, and
   pluralization of grievances for protests during his rule. Overall, our
   methodological approach allows us to compare contention and repression
   between the Hu-Wen and Xi periods and to investigate the empirical
   evidence for preventive repression, which lies at the core of the
   Chinese approach to the preservation of social order.},

Title = {Outside the Western bubble: Explaining anti-immigrant attitudes in 28
   post-communist countries},
Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 10},
Abstract = {Most studies on anti-immigrant attitudes have been conducted within the
   US or in Western European countries. As a result, the theoretical
   frameworks utilised to comprehend these attitudes are often based on a
   limited subset of the global population. Hence, it remains uncertain how
   these theories apply to regions beyond the Western context. Based on the
   Life in Transition Survey, we explore whether the theories and factors
   discussed in Western contexts can be applied to understanding
   anti-immigrant attitudes in 28 post-communist countries. We find that
   the impact of macroeconomic variables in the post-communist region
   differs from what would be expected based on existing theoretical
   frameworks. The study adds complexity to the debates surrounding the
   positive impacts of modernisation, economic development and
   democratisation on anti-immigrant attitudes. Our research suggests that
   intolerance levels are notably highest in Central and Eastern European
   EU countries. Interestingly, these levels are higher than those found in
   less developed and less democratic post-communist countries outside the
   EU. This study highlights the difficulty of deploying a comprehensive
   theoretical framework that can account for the complexities of attitudes
   across a broad range of countries.},

Abstract = {Has the ``big lie{''}-the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen
   from Donald Trump-shaped citizens' views of the legitimacy of other US
   elections? We argue that it has. Those who believe Trump's claim, whom
   we call election skeptics, lack confidence in elections for two
   interrelated reasons. First, because they think 2020 was inaccurately
   and unfairly conducted, they think that other elections will suffer a
   similar fate, and hence think these elections are illegitimate even
   before any votes are cast. Second, while most voters think elections are
   less legitimate when their preferred candidate loses, this effect will
   be especially large for election skeptics, because voter fraud gives
   them a mechanism to explain their candidate's loss. Using an original
   panel dataset spanning the 2020 and 2022 elections, we show strong
   support for these hypotheses. This has important implications for our
   elections, and their legitimacy, moving forward.},

Abstract = {This article examines Polish participation in the Iraq war (2003-2008)
   and its aftermath through a postcolonial lens within the context of
   Warsaw's foreign policy choices in the post-Cold War era. After the fall
   of communism, Poland attempted to join ``core{''} Western countries and
   institutions, while simultaneously distancing itself from the countries
   of the ``periphery{''}. The article argues that Poland has operated in a
   liminal space during the Iraq war and its aftermath as it has been
   treated as an ``internal other{''} of the West, and at the same time has
   ``othered{''} the Iraqi periphery. The article does this by applying
   three key postcolonial theories to the case study: Said's concept of
   orientalism, Coronil's concept of occidentalism and Spivak's ideas
   related to the subaltern. The article finds the following to be true:
   (a) Poland has been orientalised by core Western states while it has
   also orientalised the Iraqi and Middle Eastern periphery, (b) Poland has
   generally been a willing participant of occidentalist strategies
   concerning Iraq and the Middle East and (c) Western core states have
   attempted to speak for/silence Poland while Poland has spoken
   for/silenced the Iraqi/Middle Eastern periphery.},

Abstract = {Sovereignism is said to be on the rise: defending a nation's political
   autonomy, international borders, and cultural identity and protecting
   the domestic economy from the perils of globalisation are core demands.
   What about Latin America? To what extent are sovereignist claims a key
   component of Latin American parties' platforms and rhetoric? How do
   these vary according to national contexts and ideological foundations?
   Is sovereignism truly novel in the region? This article, relying on
   qualitative analyses of party manifestos from six different countries,
   as well as on data from the Manifesto Project, aims to map Latin
   American sovereignism in its different dimensions (political, economic,
   cultural, international) according to country and party families. As our
   data show, claims for defending or achieving `sovereignty' are a key
   component of the (mostly left-wing) populist idiolect in the region. The
   Latin American extreme right tends to adopt a sovereignist rhetoric to
   justify a traditional pro-market agenda. The article overall calls for a
   problematisation of the concept of `sovereignism' by proposing a
   stronger cross-regional perspective. There are different `varieties of
   sovereignism' depending on whether state sovereignty is primarily viewed
   as something to be restored or, alternatively, to be achieved (as is the
   case in South America).},

Abstract = {In recent decades, Japanese rice wine, sake, exports to international
   countries have developed tremendously. Recently, in particular, sake
   exports are increasing in both volume and unit value due to factors such
   as the registration of Japanese cuisine as an intangible cultural
   heritage of UNESCO in 2013 and the economic situations including the
   rapid depreciation of Japanese yen. However, there are no studies which
   investigated sake exports via empirical methods as far as we know. In
   this study, we constructed hierarchical Bayesian models and analyzed
   unbalanced panel datasets on the export of Japanese sake to China, Hong
   Kong SAR China, Singapore, Taiwan and the US by using a Markov chain
   Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and an ancillary-sufficiency interweaving
   strategy (ASIS) as the first empirical study of Japanese sake export. As
   a result, it was found that the trends in export volume and unit value
   to China, Hong Kong SAR China, Singapore and the US were significantly
   positive. In addition, although Taiwan had a negative trend before
   UNESCO registration, the trend became positive after its registration.
   Based on these results, it can be concluded that Japanese sake has been
   booming worldwide, though the degree may vary from country to country.
   Especially, we found that the UNESCO registration of Japanese food,
   Washoku, has significant effects on booming sake exports both in terms
   of volume and unit value. Finally, we divided the sake export data by
   regional customs offices in charge and conducted a detailed analysis on
   regional heterogeneity in sake exports. From the results, we found there
   were some different trends among regions.},

Title = {Analyzing Ballot Order Effects When Voters Rank Candidates},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 20},
Abstract = {How does candidate order on the ballot affect voting behavior when
   voters rank candidates? I extend the analysis of ballot order effects to
   electoral systems with ordinal ballots, where voters rank candidates,
   including ranked-choice voting (RCV). First, I discuss two types of
   ballot order effects, including ``position effects{''}-voters vote for
   specific candidates because of their ballot positions-and ``pattern
   ranking{''}-voters rank candidates geometrically given their grid-style
   ballots. Next, I discuss experimental designs for identifying and
   estimating these effects based on ballot order randomization. Moreover,
   I illustrate the proposed methods by using survey and natural
   experiments based on mayoral and congressional RCV elections in 2022. I
   find that while voters seem less susceptible to specific ballot
   positions, ballot design can still impact voters' ranking behavior via
   pattern ranking. This work has several implications for ballot design,
   survey research, and ranking data analysis. First, it shows that pattern
   ranking may affect electoral outcomes in RCV and other systems even when
   ballot order is fully randomized. Consequently, it may be worth
   considering an alternative solution to ballot order effects, which does
   not solely depend on randomization or rotation. Second, similar effects
   may impact any survey research using ranking questions. Future research
   must investigate the statistical consequences of pattern ranking for
   survey research. Finally, ranking data allow researchers to study
   diverse quantities of interest while targeting many different
   substantive questions. However, this flexibility also implies that
   analyzing ranking data can be prone to arbitrary analysis.},

Abstract = {Collective memory plays an important part in the ideational and cultural
   battlegrounds that characterise current European politics. The
   mobilisation and manipulation of the memory of Nazi-fascism, in
   particular, is a growing political and academic concern, related to the
   rise of far right parties throughout the continent and the mainstreaming
   of their ideas and positions. Focusing on the case of Italy, this
   article examines three recent examples of abuses of the country's past
   committed by Fratelli d'Italia, a far right party with a direct lineage
   to fascism, and the pivot of the current Italian government. By
   analysing the three episodes in light of a conceptual triad of abuses of
   the dark past - historical reassessment; fake history;
   evocation-cum-denial of fascist connections - the article shows how
   post-fascist FdI has engaged in the whole gamut of memory abuses
   rapidly, and shortly after rising to power. This in turn raises concerns
   about the effects of such mnemonic manipulations on the cultural
   underpinning of Italian democracy, given the party's current position of
   political, institutional, and cultural influence.},

Abstract = {We build on research on polycentric climate governance and the strategic
   behavior of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to assess the factors
   that determine the partnership choices of climate NGOs. More precisely,
   we are interested in how these factors relate to the type of governance
   actors and the governance scale at which their partners operate. We
   concentrate on 195 NGOs based in twenty-one Latin American countries.
   Our hypotheses postulate that the perceived benefits are shaped by both
   country-level factors and NGO-specific factors. Our network analysis
   reveals that the NGOs have formed networks with different types of
   organizations, which are located at different scales of the polycentric
   governance system. The findings of our regression models show that these
   factors especially explain the governance scale at which the NGOs'
   partners operate. The explanatory power of the models is lower for the
   types of actors with which the NGOs form partnerships, indicating the
   need for further theorizing.},

Abstract = {Studies of the Indonesian political economy suggest a transformation of
   government-business relationship from a ``patrimonial administrative{''}
   state, in which bureaucrats are dominant, to a ``patrimonial
   oligarchic{''} state dominated by business actors. We examine this
   proposition by analysing government-business relationship in two towns:
   a town in Sulawesi, dominated by trade, and a town with a strong
   industrial base in Java. In the first, politics still approximates that
   of a patrimonial administrative state with a weak business sector and a
   dominant bureaucracy. In the second, a local business dynasty has come
   to power, but without promoting regularisation of state-business
   relationship. Despite the differences, patronage politics are similarly
   dominant in both locations, which we illustrate by zeroing in on the
   construction sector and the distribution of infrastructure projects. We
   conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for the nature
   of urban politics in Indonesia, underscoring the significance of
   patronage across a range of settings.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a special issue on trust in elections. While the
   number of electoral democracies has grown globally, we are currently
   experiencing a crisis of electoral trust. Political polarization, social
   divisions, and the rapid spread of misinformation have all been related
   to enhanced widespread skepticism about the quality of national
   elections. The special issue is focused on two central questions: How
   can we explain variations in trust in elections at the individual and
   country levels? How does trust in elections shape political behavior? In
   the introduction essay, we frame the contributions of the special issue,
   provide descriptive statistics about trust in elections globally,
   summarize the current state of the literature, and point to avenues for
   future research.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether German respondents in an interactive
   vignette experiment prefer immigrants who are ethno-racially more
   proximate to the majority population versus whether immigrants find
   acceptance in German society as long as they follow the law and respect
   the rules and customs of society. The approach is both descriptive and
   experimental. The descriptive results indicate that despite
   liberalisation of immigration policies since 2000 there is a sizable
   reservoir of the German population who holds ethno-racial attitudes. The
   interactive experimental approach distinguishes two treatments: race and
   reason for dismissal from a job of two fictitious immigrants who are
   applying for permanent residency in Germany. Results indicate that while
   German respondents react more harshly when the reason for dismissal is
   drug possession than race, the Black immigrant is treated with more
   hostility for the same infraction than the White immigrant,
   independently of whether the reason for dismissal from a job is being
   downsized or drug possession.},

Abstract = {The Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) has been applauded for its
   contribution in eradicating the East Indonesia Mujahideen (MIT) networks
   in Poso Regency, Central Sulawesi Province. The military contributed to
   the operation in various ways, particularly intelligence gathering, and
   territorial and counter-guerrilla operations. The operation in Poso is a
   case whereby the threats are beyond the police's capabilities. On the
   one hand, counter terrorism against MIT requires deep involvement of the
   military primarily due to the strategic and structural challenges
   surrounding the conflict area. On the other hand, such profound
   entanglement can produce detrimental impacts toward democratic security
   arrangement. We argue that TNI involvement is indeed valuable but should
   be on a case-by-case basis. This article highlights that the operation
   has been able to nurture coordination between the police and the
   military. However, there are also potential risks for the future of
   counter terrorism efforts in Indonesia. Counter terrorism requires a
   multidisciplinary approach, yet the involvement of TNI in all sectors
   would only lead to suboptimal achievements of the military. This article
   also discusses the militarisation approach in counter terrorism is
   likely to escalate the use of violence.},

Title = {The split ladder of policy problems, participation, and politicization:
   constitutional water change in Ecuador and Chile},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {There is debate about whether complex problems should be addressed
   technocratically or whether they should be politicized. While many tend
   to favour technocratic decision-making and evidence based policy, for
   others politicization of policy problems is fundamental for significant
   policy change. But politicization does not always lead to problem
   solving. Nor is it always necessary. This paper addresses the question:
   Under what circumstances should problems be politicized, and what is the
   effect of such politicization? It adds politicization, through windows
   of opportunity, to the split ladder of participation to assess policy
   change through two case studies: successful and unsuccessful
   constitutional change in Ecuador (2008) and Chile respectively (2022).
   It argues that where there is no agreement on either science or policy,
   politicization is required to address lack of consensus in values, but
   constitutional protection is needed to protect minorities and the
   vulnerable, their access and human right to water. De-politicization
   stymies policy change potentially harming democracy. This paper argues
   for a citizen engaged exploration of the complex problem of climate
   change and its impacts on water, but a targeted politicization
   coincident with, but developed well in advance of, windows of
   opportunity. Moreover, policy framing correlated with complex problems
   continues to be a key consideration. Furthermore, alliances of disparate
   actors, elections of new political leaders and considerations of
   property rights and justice issues are paramount. Significant
   constitutional policy change reflects social learning, but subsequent
   court actions by policy entrepreneurs is required to effectively
   implement this change. Framing constitutional change to protect rights
   to water and effect international agreements (including the Warsaw
   International Mechanism under the climate change regime) advances water
   justice and may increase success.},

   Experiments Are Broadly Similar for Eager and Reluctant Participants},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 17},
Abstract = {Survey experiments on probability samples are a popular method for
   investigating population-level causal questions due to their strong
   internal validity. However, lower survey response rates and an increased
   reliance on online convenience samples raise questions about the
   generalizability of survey experiments. We examine this concern using
   data from a collection of 50 survey experiments which represent a wide
   range of social science studies. Recruitment for these studies employed
   a unique double sampling strategy that first obtains a sample of
   ``eager{''} respondents and then employs much more aggressive
   recruitment methods with the goal of adding ``reluctant{''} respondents
   to the sample in a second sampling wave. This approach substantially
   increases the number of reluctant respondents who participate and also
   allows for straightforward categorization of eager and reluctant survey
   respondents within each sample. We find no evidence that treatment
   effects for eager and reluctant respondents differ substantially. Within
   demographic categories often used for weighting surveys, there is also
   little evidence of response heterogeneity between eager and reluctant
   respondents. Our results suggest that social science findings based on
   survey experiments, even in the modern era of very low response rates,
   provide reasonable estimates of population average treatment effects
   among a deeper pool of survey respondents in a wide range of settings.},

Abstract = {Russia's relations with the EU have worsened over the past decade, and
   energy-related issues have been part of this regress. The attention has
   been mostly turned to natural gas and Gazprom, while Rosatom, another
   state-controlled energy giant, has been largely overlooked, although it
   may be the next vehicle fostering Russia's foreign policy goals. To find
   out whether this is the case, Hungary and Finland were chosen as case
   studies to determine whether Rosatom serves as leverage for Russian
   political influence. The research utilized the authors' analytical model
   to find manifestations of strategic behavior, pointing at political
   leveraging of the deals in point. The findings revealed that Russia
   could use Rosatom's nuclear deals as vehicles for its foreign policy
   goals. The outcome is, however, case-specific, depending on the leeway
   given by the host country.},

Abstract = {This analytical essay proposes the notion of disjointed polarization to
   characterize the nature of polarization in contemporary Chile. In
   disjointed polarization, elite-level polarization does not lead to a
   successful electoral realignment. Disjointed polarization is thus
   consistent with a long-lasting crisis of representation in which a
   serial disconnect between politicians (pursuing different polarizing
   strategies) and a sizable fraction of the electorate persists, as voters
   remain alienated from old and emerging political elites. Because the
   structural changes that make disjointed polarization persist longer than
   expected in Chile today are widespread across Latin America, the essay
   speculates on the possibility that enduring disjointed polarization
   applies to other cases where neither a ``populist realignment{''} nor
   ``generative polarization{''} took place. Instead, disjointed
   polarization might reflect the onset of a new (non-partisan
   representation) normal.},

Abstract = {Several English-language adaptations of the Indian epic Ramayana have
   been published since the beginning of the 21st century. The epic has
   been regarded and recreated as a metonym for the Indian nation.
   Contemporary versions have often referred to Indian geography and have
   tried to poetically or literally associate mythic spaces with real ones.
   In this paper, I use discourse analysis in order to study some of the
   most influential 21st-century English-language retellings of the
   Ramayana. I conclude that these and other versions of the epic describe
   India as a regionally divided nation which can ultimately be united
   through national geography, its association with mythology and the
   contrast between the geography of India and that of foreign nations. In
   this sense, I regard these contemporary versions as a `literary
   pilgrimage' through which Indian readers can get to know the geography
   of their nation and regard it as sacred.},

   limitations of pension climate strategies},

Abstract = {Despite the decades of international climate negotiations and several
   landmark agreements, global efforts to date to restrict fossil fuel
   production in line with climate targets have been unsuccessful. As
   national and international policies continue to fall short of phasing
   out fossil fuels, increasing attention has been paid to non-state
   actors, like pension funds, as a potential source of more ambitious
   climate action. As major asset owners, large shareholders in fossil fuel
   companies, and historically activist investors, pension funds are
   theoretically well-placed to contribute to phasing out fossil fuels.
   Despite growing recognition of this potential role for pension funds and
   other major investors in climate change mitigation, there has been
   little attention to pension funds' historical record on climate change,
   or to how their climate strategies have developed and changed over time.
   This paper examines how the climate strategies of the largest US and
   European pension funds have evolved in relation to key developments in
   international climate agreements and the extent to which these
   strategies contribute to restricting fossil fuel supply. Through an
   analysis of the annual, governance, and sustainability reports of 6
   pension funds from 1997 to 2022, we examine the strategies pension funds
   have adopted to address both climate change and fossil fuels. Pension
   funds have demonstrated responsiveness to the signals of international
   climate agreements, adopting a range of strategies with respect to
   climate change (amongst others, integrating ESG principles, increasing
   their sustainable investments, and setting net zero goals). Their
   explicit attention to fossil fuels and contribution to supply-side
   interventions take the form of systematic shareholder engagement,
   (selective) divestment, and lobbying policymakers. While pension fund
   climate action is growing , the ambition of their strategies is not
   aligned with a rapid fossil fuel phaseout; their efforts are often
   focussed on improving disclosure and transparency and demonstrate
   complacency with minimal improvements from fossil fuel companies. If
   pension funds are to significantly contribute to phasing out fossil
   fuels, redefining pension fund responsibilities and the traditional
   shareholder role will likely be required.},

Abstract = {Value polarization is one of the key factors in societal development.
   This research focuses on whether opinions concerning gender roles in the
   domestic and public spheres are polarized in European societies, a topic
   still under-investigated. Based on the fifth wave of European Values
   Study data (2017-2020), the study shows that gender role attitudes in
   the domestic sphere are more polarized than those in the public sphere.
   Polarization by education, level of income, migration background, and
   degree of religiosity is stronger for gender role attitudes in the
   domestic sphere, whereas polarization by gender is stronger for gender
   role attitudes in the public sphere. Both gender role attitudes in the
   public and domestic spheres are most strongly polarized by education. At
   the same time, belonging to a social group with higher education, higher
   income, and lower religiosity can promote more progressive views towards
   gender roles. Opinions in Eastern European countries tend to seem more
   polarized than in Western European countries, even if with some
   exceptions. In countries with a higher level of gender equality, the
   level of polarization is a bit lower, while in countries where there is
   a remarkable rise of anti-gender narratives, opponent and conflictual
   views are higher.},

Abstract = {This study aims to examine the loss and damage experienced by coastal
   regions from the perspective of adaptation. It also seeks to evaluate
   the adaptation techniques employed when migration is utilized as a
   significant approach to mitigate the effects of loss and damage on
   coastal communities. This study evaluates the extent of loss and damage
   caused by constraints on adaptation. Two districts, Khulna and Satkhira,
   in the Khulna division of Bangladesh, were chosen for the study. In
   these districts, a total of twenty-four detailed interviews and one
   focus group discussion (FGD) were conducted with individuals living in
   rural areas whom climate-related effects and disasters have impacted.
   Additionally, seven interviews were conducted with climate migrants
   residing in informal settlements within the words of Khulna City
   Corporation. The process of identifying appropriate interview candidates
   involves utilizing a combination of specific criteria and snowball
   sampling techniques. The study employed NVivo 14 software to conduct
   theme analysis on textual data obtained from interviews. In the coding
   procedure, we sequentially employed semantic coding, latent coding,
   categorization, pattern exploration, and theme creation, all of which
   were in line with the research aim. The study indicates that most
   affected persons utilize seasonal and temporary movement as an adaptive
   strategy to deal with the slow effects of climate change, such as
   increasing temperatures and salinity in rural regions, and when they
   encounter limitations in their ability to adapt. Conversely, they opted
   for permanent migration in response to stringent constraints imposed by
   severe climate events like cyclones and river erosion, leaving them with
   no alternative but to move to urban regions. Social networks are crucial
   in influencing migration choices, as several families depend on
   information provided by urban relatives and rural neighbors to inform
   their relocation decisions. Nevertheless, not all individuals impacted
   by the situation express a desire to relocate; others opt to remain in
   rural areas due to their sentimental attachment to their birthplaces and
   a sense of dedication to their ancestral territory. Due to the
   exorbitant cost of urban life, they believe that opting not to migrate
   is a more practical option for addressing the repercussions of
   climate-induced loss and damage. The study's findings aid policymakers
   in determining migration strategies and policies to address the adverse
   effects of coastal population displacement in Bangladesh. Additionally,
   it aids in determining strategies to address the challenges faced by
   climate migrants in both urban and rural environments.},

Abstract = {In this article, I explore the relationship between religion and
   nationhood among contemporary Lithuanian migrants in Norway. The central
   puzzle is the lack of an open national feeling in the religious setting.
   However, academic literature has well documented the tight connection
   between the Catholic Church and Lithuanian nationhood. Interpreting the
   empirical data from qualitative interviews and participant observations
   through the lens of everyday nationalism, I argue that seeming
   lacklustre national sensibilities among Lithuanian Catholics do not
   signal Catholicism's demise as the vehicle for reproducing Lithuanian
   nationhood. Instead, it is an expression of the resilience of banal
   forms of nationalism reproduced via the institutional framework of the
   Catholic Church and the practices of the clergy and laity. I suggest
   that the case of Lithuanian Catholics in Norway intimates the need for a
   more nuanced approach to the concept of individual agency as opposed to
   a strict agency vs. banality dichotomy in everyday nationhood
   scholarship. Scrutinising habitual, banal forms of nationhood, together
   with the conscious ones, is pivotal in comprehending the complex
   relationship between religion and nationalism in empirical cases where
   visible displays of national sensibilities may be subtle but nonetheless
   meaningful.},

Abstract = {This study investigates Indonesia's ambitious artificial intelligence
   (AI) policy within the context of its decentralised governance
   structure. Through in-depth case studies in Jakarta, Central Java, and
   East Java, we analyse emerging AI-based policy responses and their
   challenges in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Drawing from
   elite interviews conducted with central and local government officials
   and documentary research, this study offers rare insights into the local
   perspective on the struggle to accommodate the central government's
   ambitious plan with limited resources. This article finds that the
   divergence in the views and visions of AI between central and local
   governments has complicated the formulation and implementation of
   AI-based policies. Central authorities wield a dominant role, evident
   through regulatory mandates and a centralised decision-making approach
   that can potentially constrain local autonomy. This power asymmetry,
   coupled with the lack of specific AI-focused regulations, challenges
   local governments' capacity to independently design and manage AI
   initiatives aligned with their unique contexts. Interestingly, instead
   of showing their resistance towards the ambitious national plan, local
   leaders have embraced AI policies, positioning them as innovative tools
   to enhance popularity in the lead-up to the 2024 general election.},
