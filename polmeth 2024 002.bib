Abstract = {Do long-term propaganda and indoctrination undermine media trust?
   Building on studies of communist legacies, I examine whether trust in
   media in post-communist countries can be explained by past or
   contemporaneous experiences. I find that trust in media is lower in
   post-communist countries, but this trust deficit is more likely a
   consequence of the post-communist period. It is higher among
   authoritarian regimes, which suggests that contemporaneous experiences
   matter; citizens with longer exposure to communism trust the media more;
   finally, the deficit grows as the communist past becomes more distant.
   These findings have implications for institutional development in the
   post-communist world.},

   disadvantage},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {88},

Abstract = {Young people continue to be underrepresented in formal politics.
   Previous research indicates that being a nonmiddle-aged candidate
   negatively affects electoral success. What are the origins of this
   performance gap? This article explores three potential sources of
   age-related disadvantage: Party affiliation, individual resources, and
   direct party and voter support. Drawing on data from 21 OECD countries,
   I show, first, that many age-related disadvantages take a non-linear
   shape. Both young and senior candidates run for smaller, poorer, and
   more marginal parties. They spend significantly less money on their
   campaigns than middle-aged competitors, and young candidates furthermore
   lack political experience. Young and senior candidates are placed on
   lower list positions in party-centred electoral systems and receive
   fewer preference votes in candidate-centred systems. Thus, both parties
   and voters fail to effectively counter structural age-disadvantages.
   This article contributes to our understanding of the shape and origins
   of age-related electoral disadvantages and illustrates the multifaceted
   reasons for youth's continued political under-representation.},

Abstract = {John Maynard Keynes is often seen as the quintessential thinker of the
   short run, calling on us to focus our intellectual and material
   resources on the present. This poses an intriguing puzzle in light of
   Keynes's own influential speculations about the future. I use this
   seeming tension as an opening into Keynes's politics of time, both as a
   crucial dimension of his political thought and a contribution to debates
   about political temporality and intertemporal choice. Keynes's
   insistence on radical uncertainty translated into a skepticism toward
   intertemporal calculus as not only morally objectionable but also at
   risk of undermining actual future possibilities. Instead of either
   myopic presentism or calculated futurity, Keynes advocated bold
   experimentation in the present to open up new possibilities for an
   uncertain future. This points to the need to grapple with how to align
   multiple overlapping time horizons while appreciating the performativity
   of competing conceptions of the future.},

Abstract = {The concept of resource curse is widely accepted in the extant
   literature. However, the burden of proof remains high as some
   resource-rich countries experience rapid economic growth. This study
   examines how Nigeria's strategy for governance and management of revenue
   proceeds from petroleum resources has helped sustain rent seeking
   behavior, the resource curse phenomenon, and under- development of the
   country. Using the theory of new institutionalism and a process- tracing
   method, the article argues that political and historical dynamics in
   establishing legislation for governance and management of oil and gas
   revenues engendered path- dependent rent seeking practices sustained by
   selfish political elites. The resource curse is not universal or
   inevitable in resource rich countries, but largely a product of
   institutionalization and sustenance of initial unhealthy practices. We
   recommend that recognizing the need for savings, stabilization, and
   investment, and setting clear fiscal rules to check excessive political
   discretion will reduce rent seeking and the resource curse in Nigeria
   and elsewhere.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {Preference congruence between masses and elites lies at the heart of the
   study of democratic representation. In this article, substantiated by a
   meta-analysis of 154 studies published between 1960 and 2022, we show
   that the literature on mass-elite congruence has increased exponentially
   in the past decade. Despite the growing academic interest, the
   publications mainly focus on Western Europe and leave two critical blind
   spots. First, at the mass level, little attention has been paid to
   distinguishing between voters and non-voters and between independents
   and partisans. Second, at the elite level, presidents have been
   overlooked, including those studies examining presidential or
   semi-presidential democracies. In this article, we demonstrate the
   existence of two blind spots with a meta-analysis, explain their
   significance for political representation and test the extent to which
   they affect mass-elite congruence measurement. The article contributes
   to the comparative study of representation by illustrating how filling
   in these two blind spots is necessary to ensure a reliable and
   comprehensive assessment of mass-elite congruence.},

Title = {The political consequences of the end of nationalist violence: the
   Basque Country and Corsica in comparative perspective},
Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-23},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The last decade has seen the disappearance of nationalist political
   violence in two minority nations of Western Europe: the (Spanish) Basque
   Country and Corsica. Considering the importance of violence in the
   politics of these two communities (since 1959 in the Basque Country and
   1976 in Corsica), the 2014 announcement by the Front de liberation
   nationale corse of its `demilitarization' and the dissolution of Euskadi
   Ta Askatasuna in 2018 represented potential critical junctures in the
   political development of both the Basque Country and Corsica. What,
   then, was the impact of the end of political violence in the two
   communities and why did this new `civil peace' play out differently
   across the two cases, if it did? This article traces the process of
   political development in the Basque Country and Corsica through and
   after the end of violence. It shows that such end led to a strengthening
   of nationalism and a surge of claims for increased autonomy much more in
   Corsica than in the Basque Country. Then, the paper looks for an
   explanation for this divergence. It focuses on four differences between
   the two cases that could logically account for the different outcomes:
   constitutional status (the Basque Country has legislative and fiscal
   autonomy whereas Corsica has neither); the configuration of political
   power within each community (Basque nationalists dominate Basque
   politics whereas non-nationalist forces controlled Corsica until
   recently); the ideological positioning of the nationalist parties (more
   divergent in the Basque Country than in Corsica); and the levels of past
   violence (high in the Basque Country and low in Corsica). All these
   factors make post-violence alliances between nationalist forces easier
   in Corsica than the Basque Country.},

   Army in anticipation of an `immediate' continental war, and instead
   asserts that, as the world's geopolitical centre of gravity
   progressively shifts south and east, Britain can expect to enjoy a
   strategic position further removed from the frontlines of potential
   conflict than at any time in recent history. Re-evaluating threats from
   Russia and China, Joseph Reilly advocates for a strategic reset, with a
   greater emphasis on leveraging industrial capabilities to support allies
   instead of the present focus on building large land forces ill-suited to
   Britain's contemporary strategic environment.},

Abstract = {Political elites-like ministers or members of parliament-face numerous
   phenomena that are characterized by uncertainty. Uncertainty ranges from
   resolvable to radical, whereby the former can be removed with more or
   better information, but radical uncertainty cannot. Remarkably, little
   is known about political elites' responses to such phenomena, both
   theoretically (what responses are likely?) and empirically (which
   responses do political elites display?). This ``New Ideas{''}
   contribution addresses the theoretical lacuna by presenting a
   multidisciplinary conceptual map of possible responses to radical and
   resolvable uncertainty. These responses influence political elites'
   effectiveness in solving problems and, thus, how representative
   democracies function. The article also sketches how to identify the
   responses empirically.},

Title = {Confidence Across Cleavage: The Swiss Rural-Urban Divide, Place-Based
   Identity and Political Trust},
Journal = {SWISS POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-65},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Since political trust is crucial to the survival of political systems,
   securing its high levels is essential. While Switzerland exhibits a
   large rural-urban divide in direct democratic votes, it has not yet been
   researched whether such a divide also exists with regard to political
   trust. In my investigation of the Swiss rural-urban divide in political
   trust, I bring in place as a social identity and evaluate whether the
   rural-urban divide is contingent upon place-based identity. I employ OLS
   regression models using original survey data from 2022 with about 4,000
   respondents. Results reveal a significant but irrelevantly small
   rural-urban difference in political trust. However, when interacting
   place-based identity with place of living, I find that identity inverts
   the rural-urban divide. When place-based identity is low, rural
   residents exhibit higher levels of political trust than urban residents,
   but when place-based identity is high, trust is higher in urban than in
   rural places.
   Politisches Vertrauen ist fur das uberleben politischer Systeme
   entscheidend. In der Schweiz zeigt sich bei den direktdemokratischen
   Abstimmungen ein grosser Land-Stadt-Graben; es ist aber noch nicht
   erforscht, ob ein solcher Graben auch bei politischem Vertrauen besteht.
   In dieser Untersuchung des Schweizer Land-Stadt-Grabens bei politischem
   Vertrauen wird der Ort als soziale Identitat miteinbezogen und
   evaluiert, ob der Land-Stadt-Graben von der ortsbezogenen Identitat
   abhangig ist. Ich verwende OLS-Regressionsmodelle und
   Original-Umfragedaten aus dem Jahr 2022 mit rund 4.000 Befragten. Die
   Ergebnisse zeigen einen signifikanten, aber unerheblich kleinen
   Unterschied zwischen Stadt und Land in Bezug auf politisches Vertrauen.
   Bei einer Interaktion zwischen ortsbezogener Identitat und Wohnort zeigt
   sich, dass die Identitat den Effekt des Land-Stadt-Grabens umkehrt. Wenn
   ortsbezogene Identitat schwach ausgepragt ist, haben Landbewohner ein
   hoheres Mass an politischem Vertrauen als Stadtbewohner; wenn aber die
   ortsbezogene Identitat stark ausgepragt ist, ist das Vertrauen in der
   Stadt hoher als auf dem Land.
   La confiance politique est cruciale pour la survie des systemes
   politiques. La Suisse presente un fosse villes-campagnes dans les votes
   democratiques directs, mais aucune recherche n'a ete effectuee pour
   savoir si une telle difference existe aussi concernant la confiance
   politique. Dans cette etude, je considere le lieu comme une identite
   sociale et j'evalue si le fosse villes-campagnes depend de l'identite
   basee sur le lieu. J'utilise des modeles de regression OLS a partir de
   donnees d'enquete originales datant de 2022 et comprenant environ 4 000
   repondants. Les resultats revelent un fosse villes-campagnes
   significatif mais insignifiant. Cependant, en faisant interagir
   l'identite fondee sur le lieu avec le lieu de residence, l'identite
   inverse l'effet du fosse. Lorsque l'identite fondee sur le lieu de
   residence est faible, les residents ruraux affichent des niveaux de
   confiance plus eleves que les residents urbains, mais lorsque l'identite
   est forte, la confiance est plus forte dans les zones urbaines.
   Siccome la fiducia politica e cruciale per la sopravvivenza dei sistemi
   politici, e importante fare in modo che essa si situi a livelli elevati.
   Sebbene la Svizzera conosca un divario citta-campagna significativo
   nelle votazioni popolari, finora non e stata studiata l'esistenza di un
   tale divario in ambito della fiducia politica. Nella mia analisi del
   divario citta-campagna in Svizzera ho considerato il luogo come identita
   sociale e esaminato in quale misura tale divario sia influenzato
   dall'identita legata al luogo. Usando modelli di regressione OLS e dati
   originali del 2022 con 4000 partecipanti, i risultati dell'analisi
   rivelano che la differenza fra citta e campagna relativa alla fiducia
   politica e statisticamente significativa ma di fatto trascurabile.
   Tuttavia, quando si fa interagire l'identita legata al luogo con il
   luogo di residenza, si scopre che questa forma di identita inverte il
   divario citta-campagna. Se e poco pronunciata, il livello di fiducia
   politica e maggiore fra gli abitanti delle aree rurali rispetto a quelli
   delle citta, ma quando e piu forte, la fiducia politica e maggiore nelle
   aree urbane rispetto a quelle rurali.},

Abstract = {Feminist standpoint theorists highlight how relations of power and
   inequality impact our knowledge of the social world (Smith 1974). The
   hierarchical positioning of different social groups creates a world in
   which the experiences and perspectives of certain people are
   acknowledged while others are silenced (Hartsock 1998; Hekman 1997).
   Moreover, a researcher's personal background-her race, gender, class,
   and sexuality, among other factors-condition what she is able to learn
   and how (Collins 2000). Together, this literature underscores how the
   social world-and who we are within it-shapes knowledge production.},

Title = {An Unlikely Rights Revolution: Legal Mobilization in Scandinavia Since
   the 1970s},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {42},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Why have civil society groups in Scandinavia increasingly turned to
   legal mobilization in recent decades? In Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, a
   legal-political culture based on parliamentary supremacy, deferential
   judiciaries, strong-state corporatism, and jurisprudential scepticism
   towards rights talk supposedly discourages groups in civil society from
   seeking societal change through litigation. Yet, in all three countries,
   diverse groups and organizations in civil society have increasingly
   adopted litigation strategies for a broad range of causes. In this
   paper, we seek to account for how and why this shift has occurred.
   Drawing on socio-legal mobilization theory, we compare Denmark, Norway,
   and Sweden across three episodes from the 1970s to today. Litigation has
   gradually moved from the political margins to the mainstream. Our
   findings suggest that while European law, domestic institutional
   reforms, and a proliferating human rights discourse have opened new ways
   for resourceful groups and entrepreneurial individuals to challenge the
   status quo, parliamentary and corporatist channels remain often viable
   and preferred alternatives for mainstream organizations. The paper thus
   contributes to the emerging literature on how civil society groups in
   Scandinavia employ litigation strategies by offering a comparative and
   historical assessment and contributes to knowledge about the factors
   that shape legal mobilization by civil society groups.},

Abstract = {This article begins by examining contemporary theories of imperialism,
   then highlights the relevance of older interpretations. As a matter of
   fact, Lenin's theory-especially when he speaks of a ``merger of banking
   capital and industrial capital,{''} anticipates the direct and indirect
   role played by financial capital in the export of capital by the center
   to the periphery. Such export reinforces the drainage of surplus value
   towards the center through the double process of unequal exchange and
   overexploitation. The article then returns to Marx who maintains that
   imperialism could be explained by the downward trend in the profit rate
   in developed countries, when the latter do not find enough means to
   counteract it at home and look for new ones through colonization and
   international trade. Marx suggests another counter-trend which is
   confirmed today: the transfer of productive work to the periphery,
   because only productive labor creates value. The article finally focuses
   on the case of China, by asking: How was it able, unlike other countries
   and despite unequal exchange, to benefit from foreign investments, thus
   to emancipate itself from imperialism? And what does it do in turn to
   help other underdeveloped countries develop without subjugating them?},

Abstract = {Transparency laws, such as the Right to Information (RTI) in India and
   Open Government Information (OGI) in China, seek to confront corruption.
   They have been able to expand people's space against corruption and
   other abuses of power, thus demanding accountability from the
   powerholders. Instead of particular regimes like democratic or
   authoritarian, we employ the Quality of Government (QoG) as a context to
   understand corruption control in India and China. Yet, due to various
   socio-political limitations, QoG remains inadequate in India; and uneven
   in China these cripple the promises of transparency laws. Hence, it is
   necessary that India prioritizes human development, which shall require
   better QoG and China addresses its weaker areas in QoG.},

Abstract = {In this survey, a group of Constitutional Law professors answer a set of
   questions about the Spanish Constitutional Court, after more than forty
   years of existence. On one hand, certain questions deal with the
   organizational design of the Court, the organization of work, its
   functioning, and about reforms. On the other hand, a second group of
   questions deal with the role played by the court in its different
   facets: as a body that control the constitutionality of the law, as a
   guarantor of fundamental rights and as an actor in the development of
   the territorial organization of the State. Finally, the respondents
   analyze the challenges derived from supranational integration and
   globalization that the Court must face.},

Title = {DIVISION AND CONSOLIDATION IN RUSSIAN SOCIETY RESULTING FROM THE RUSSIAN
   SPECIAL MILITARY OPERATION},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {1},
Pages = {104-119},
Abstract = {The paper, written on the basis of all-Russian sociological surveys in
   2021-2023, examines the attitude of Russian society to the Special
   Military Operation in Ukraine (SMO). On the basis of the comparison of
   empirical data characterising this attitude, the dynamics of the
   attitude towards the SMO is studied. A detailed description of
   socio-psychological differences in Russians' assessment of the special
   military operation, its consequences, as well as the impact of the SMO
   on the social behaviour of Russians is given. An analysis of
   correlations between the relevant sociological indicators allows the
   authors to create a social typology of these differences and to explain
   their emergence in the context of value orientations, world outlook,
   personal life successes, trust in authorities of different levels and
   emotional dominance in the perception of Russian reality. A sociological
   characterisation of Russians' involvement in various forms of support
   for the participants of SMO and their families, in particular, in the
   development of the volunteer movement, is given. The article pays
   special attention to analysing the connection between the variety of
   views on Russia's development paths and the differences in the
   assessments of its policy and its actions in Ukraine. Based on empirical
   research, the authors show that the implementation of the SMO has
   influenced the balance of opinion on Russia's development model in the
   direction of an increase in the share of its citizens who believe that
   Russia is a separate civilisation and should not live according to the
   rules set by the West. The ongoing dispute between the adherents of the
   country's original way of development and their Western- oriented
   opponents has to a greater or lesser extent affected the assessment of
   various aspects of the SMO and its consequences. However, the line of
   demarcation between these historical traditions does not overlap with
   the line of demarcation of positions on the SMO, which has not led to a
   frontal split in Russian society.},

Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the comparative case-study of the relations
   between the Nordic and Baltic countries in 1989-2004 and with Ukraine
   from 2014 to the present day. The aim of the article is to identify
   change and continuity trends in Nordic states foreign policies and their
   tasks towards the post-Soviet space. The research is based on the
   published sources of the Gorbachev Foundation, documents of the Archive
   of the Foreign Policy of the Russian Federation and the memoirs of
   Brigadier General Michael H. Klemmesen, who was in charge of the
   military cooperation between Denmark and the Baltic countries in the
   1990s. During the ending stage of the Cold War and in the context of
   growing contacts between Northern European states and the newly
   independent Baltic states, the Nordic balance and the constant
   interaction of the Nordic countries with the EU and NATO remained highly
   important. In both cases regarding the support for the Baltic countries
   during the collapse of the USSR and the weakening of Russia, and with
   the start of a Special military operation of the Russian Federation in
   Ukraine, the countries of Northern Europe despite the fundamentally
   different security situations took similar steps to abandon previous
   prudence, to revise foreign policy and defense concepts and expand
   cooperation with the EU and NATO as pillars of the Euro-Atlantic
   community. The main driving force behind providing military assistance
   to the Ukraine and contemporary Baltic-Scandinavian cooperation remains
   the same as in 1989-2004 that is to counter Russia and limit its sphere
   of influence.},

Title = {LGTBIQ+ biographies in Spain, from police files to YouTube},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Biographies, embedded in the narrative conventions of a specific culture
   (Plummer, 1995), help to link human actions with socially understandable
   stories (Polkinghorne, 1988: Butler, 1991). LGTBIQ+ biographical stories
   in Spain have experienced a fast transformation in the last forty years.
   From an LGTBIQ+ biographical construction made through social control
   from police files during the dictatorship and post-dictatorship, to the
   emergence of the narratives of the self (Ellis, 1991), ``mystories{''}
   (Ulmer y Koro-Ljungberg, 2015) or autoethnographies on social media. For
   LGTBIQ+ people, social media have provided an opportunity to generate
   and develop a consistent self (Beck y Beck-Gernsheim, 2003), and at the
   same time its political significance has been revealed (De Ridder y Van
   Bauwel, 2015) in a social context where LGTBIQ+ identity is fully legal
   but is still part of a heteronormative social context (Butler, 1991;
   Santore, 2011). Taking the accounts of Elsa Ruiz C \& oacute;mica and
   Dulceida, we intend to understand the historical moment in which the
   digital LGTBIQ+ autobiographical story was emancipated in Spain. From a
   critical point of view (Van Zoonen, 1994) we want to focus on elements
   such as the authorship of the accounts, the critical moments that
   articulate the story, as well as the audiovisual production and
   aesthetics of technological mediation, which reveal the reappropriation
   strategies of LGTBIQ+ narratives in a historical context where LGTBIQ+
   people whose police biographies are still in the archives, still live
   together with teenager youtubers (Gasol, 2022)},

Abstract = {The crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the growing financing needs,
   and the consequent deterioration of public finances in many countries
   have created a propitious scenario for the return of the International
   Monetary Fund (IMF) to Latin America after almost a decade and a half of
   their estrangement. This paper aims at analyzing the relationship
   between the organization and the region in the context of the
   coronavirus. We seek to understand to what extent their renewed
   relations will mirror the IMF's ``oldfashioned{''} preferences that have
   characterized its interventions during the last two decades of the 20th
   century and the beginning of the 21st century. For this purpose, we
   first examine the Fund's official position, reflected in its flagship
   publications. We affirm that the institution, in its discourse, is
   increasingly permissive with the use of fiscal stimulus and the State's
   leading role in crisis resolution. Second, we confront the IMF's
   rhetoric with its practices, reflected in conditionality and policy
   recommendations contained in specific agreements signed with Latin
   American countries in the context of the current crisis. We conclude
   that the orthodox approach persists in the IMF's practices, but is
   accompanied by growing adaptive changes.},

Abstract = {If the world is to overcome the threat of climate change, a price must
   be set on car-bon. A carbon tax is a means of creating a carbon price,
   and it is an ideal tax in that, unlike most taxes, it promotes economic
   efficiency. Yet many countries have no carbon tax. The reason is that
   there are strong political interests opposed to taxing carbon. I shall
   argue that these interests need to be appeased by fully compensa-ting
   anyone who would otherwise be harmed by a carbon tax. This includes the
   owners and workers in the fossil fuel industries. If a carbon tax is to
   be successful, it needs to be introduced alongside an appropriate system
   of compensation. Some of the compensation will need to be paid out of
   public debt, and this will be feasi-ble for many countries only if they
   are supported by a new financial institution: a World Climate Bank.},

Abstract = {Russia's war against Ukraine has also deepened the lines of social
   conflict in Kazakhstan. However, neither Ukraine's supporters, nor those
   who support Moscow's view of the war are homogeneous groups. Public
   debate about the war is forcing people to think about national identity.
   This has fostered a new sense of community, particularly among Ukraine's
   supporters. The state is trying to contain social tension with threats
   of punishment. At the same time, it lends support to social initiatives
   whose goals include ``harmony{''} and ``stability{''}.},

Title = {Inefficient Concessions and Mediation},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {433-458},
Abstract = {When two parties are engaged in conflict and each distrusts the other's
   ability to cooperate or make peace, concessions can be used to indicate
   an interest in cooperation or peacemaking. However, when negotiating
   parties are concerned that concessions could be used against them in the
   future, a lack of trust can prevent optimal concessions from being made
   and therefore reduce the possibility of peace or cooperation. Using a
   repeated game that is preceded by an opportunity to signal one's
   commitment to cooperation through the provision of concessions, we
   formally demonstrate that concerns over the future use of concessions
   can explain the existence of inefficient concessions. We then use
   mechanism design to explore ways a third-party mediator can act as a
   guarantor that promised concessions would be delivered, thereby reducing
   inefficiencies and increasing the potential for peace and cooperation.
   In this process, we open up a new rationale for mediation: to increase
   the efficiency of signaling in a preliminary round of negotiations and
   to overcome the concern that concessions could be used against the giver
   in the future.},

   requirement of the Canada Student Jobs program (CSJ) compared to that of
   the no-attestation version of 2017, and that of the revised CSJ

   and various evangelical Christian denominations) collectively received
   less than half the funds they received in 2017, and lost just over 3,000
   jobs in 2018, or just under half the jobs secured 2017. In 2019
   religious-based groups regained about 2,700 jobs. (2) what jobs the
   religious groups lost in 2018 were picked up by non-religious
   applicants. The latter received a modest increase in funding in 2018
   over the previous year, and another increase in 2019.},

   data from the Latinobar \& oacute;metro 2023, which includes two stages:
   the first, based on descriptive statistics; and the second, involving a
   binary logistic regression model. Perceptions in the Andean countries
   were analyzed in terms of: satisfaction with democracy (below the
   regional average); immigration (seen as harmful and causing an increase
   in crime); and types of violence and concern about it (on the streets
   and a lot of concern). After performing a binary logistic regression
   statistical model, the main results were: statistical relevance of four
   independent variables (of the 295 tested) grouped into a) economic and
   social factors, b) institutional and domestic policy factors, c)
   security factors, and d) foreign policy factors. The main conclusion is
   that immigration and are at the root of satisfaction with in the Andean

Abstract = {This essay challenges the prevailing consensus that the current
   depravations of the labor of the American university, primarily
   precarity and its associated ills, are the result of the neoliberal
   orthodoxy that dominated the late twentieth century. It offers an
   exploration of the influence of the nineteenth century German university
   on the formation of the then nascent U.S. system of higher education.
   Through this excavation it is shown that along with the foundational
   principle of wissenschaft as the indissoluble unity of teaching and
   research came the two-tier employment system of stable employmentfor
   some and precarious work lives for many. Understood as the ``unofficial
   university{''} this analysis suggests that contingency is not a
   neoliberal virus imported from outside the university but instead a
   systemic employment feature present at its founding. The essay concludes
   by exploring the implications of this reassessment of neoliberalism for
   the burgeoning field of Critical University Studies as it reimagines the
   university for the twenty-first century as a locus for increasing social
   justice.},

Abstract = {The beginning of 2023 was marked by large expectactations regarding the
   mate-rialization of the social transformation proposed by President
   Gustavo Petro. As the year progressed, the breakdown of the legislative
   coalition, and technical challenges, complicated the implementation of
   reforms. This article provides a brief overview of the reforms and the
   tensions framing them. It then focuses on the policy known as ``Total
   Peace{''}, that proposes a transversal view of economic and social
   transformations as the key to a sustainable peace, and that proposes
   peace accords and dialogues with diverse armed groups, including those
   lacking clear political agendas, and motivated by economic incentives.
   The article describes the content and evolution of the policy to then
   argue that three factors are key to understand the evolution of
   simultaneous negotiations with armed groups: 2) the difficulties of
   distin-guishing the criminal or political nature of these groups, 1) the
   fragmentation of armed groups and 3) the need to coordinate a complex
   and fragmented state in the implementation of these processes.},

Abstract = {This documentary research article aims to locate the impacts of the
   armed conflict convergence, disputes over the border and migration
   (triple impact), on educational processes in Arauca. Also, it seeks to
   recognize exercises of resistance and strategies for the human rights
   promotion and peacebuilding, from the educational sector, in response to
   it. To achieve this purpose, a second -order literature review was
   carried out, prioritizing recent specialized archives in the territory,
   inorden to generate a contrasted analysis about this triple impact. The
   main findings include a poorly documented reality, despite how urgent
   its approach is; spirals of violence at school and life trajectories,
   intensified by state abandonment; leaderships and school groups that
   carry out peace actions during shootings in a never stop war
   environment.},

Title = {The Hero, the White Savior, and the Smuggler: Criminalized Figures in
   the Landscape of Solidarity Toward Migrants},
Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {304-322},
Abstract = {One recent shift in the ever-expanding crackdown on migration and
   implementation of a hostile environment for migrants in the EU has been
   the criminalization of migrant solidarity. Using various legal tools, EU
   governments have been trying to hinder solidarity actions from civil
   society. In particular, a narrative depicting civilians helping migrants
   as criminals has been elaborated by European organizations and
   strengthened by far -right groups and dominant press outlets. In
   reaction, a counter-narrative has been constructed and spread by
   pro-migrant groups and liberal media, which presents criminalized
   activists as criminalized heroes and their actions as humanitarian.
   Based on a critical discourse analysis of academic texts, press
   articles, and empirical research with pro-migrant activists, this
   article examines two criminal figures from the civilian search and
   rescue field: the ``activist associated with smugglers{''} and its
   counterpart, the ``criminalized hero.{''} Through the lens of figuration
   of crime and social justice, the article brings a new understanding of
   the deand repoliticization processes that occur in the field of
   humanitarian help and migration. By analyzing these two figures, the
   paper also contributes to a better understanding of the competing moral
   orders underpinning criminal and social justice claims in the field of
   solidarity toward migrants. On the one hand, the figure of the activist
   associated with smuggler is part of a criminal justice narrative
   depicting migration as a threat to political, social, and economic
   stability. On the other hand, the criminalized hero figure includes a
   counter-narrative to this moral order based on the defense of a social
   justice frame of solidarity and the protection of human rights. Within
   the pro-migrant activist's scene, the criminalized hero and its social
   justice frame are criticized for reproducing racist and post -colonial
   practices of humanitarianism.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Abstract = {The draft General Education and Financing Law of the Educational Reform
   of 1970 in Spain was proposed as a comprehensive reform of training,
   based on equal opportunities, and free and compulsory education.
   However, the debates in the Parliament of the draft of Law and the
   provisions finally established with the promulgation of the General
   Education Law show in an exemplary way what the developmentalist
   authoritarian reformism; was most widely. Within a mechanism of social
   reproduction supported by an elitist education, developmental reformism
   in education was limited by the contradiction of advancing in a
   technocratic modernization under traditional and conservative principles
   and privileges. A historical- educational research is carried out,
   through documentary and historical analysis of parliamentary and
   newspaper debates, together secondary sources. From these ideological
   premises, this paper analyzes how in the debates of the Parliament,
   around the project of the General Education Law of 1970, the need of
   democratic opening, of the end of the sixties of the twentieth century,
   collided with the desire to maintain the ideological and political bases
   of the Franco<acute accent>s regime.},

Abstract = {The current cycle of interstate rivalry and crisis of European security
   raises the issues of civilizational identity of Russia and relations
   between the West and East of Europe. The analysis examines a broad range
   of political, historical and cultural problems that determine the modern
   place and role of Russia in Europe. The current features of interstate
   rivalry and its structure are revealed. An analysis of the causes and
   historical parallels of recent events, including those related to the
   escalation of the Ukrainian crisis, is given. The strategic risks and
   opportunities of Russian foreign policy in Europe are outlined. It is
   underlined that the increasing aggressiveness of Western policy is
   dictated by the crisis of the neoliberal model of globalization. The
   European space of the EU and NATO increasingly finds itself in a
   situation where its ability to play a dominant role in the world is
   decreasing and it becomes necessary to adapt to the conditions of a
   polycentric world order. The inability of the West to keep pace with
   event produces the search for an external enemy, and the growing
   mentality of a besieged fortress. The West increasingly imports external
   risks by pedalling the Ukrainian crisis as well as the dogmatic course
   towards expanding the EU and NATO at the expense of Ukraine and other
   post-Soviet countries. In the current circumstances, while making
   much-needed efforts to preserve and strengthen Russian identity, it is
   important not to leave the concept of Europe at the mercy of those who
   do not understand Russia or are hostile to it.},

Journal = {CIMEXUS},

Volume = {19},

Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {Studies on the exercise of autonomy of indigenous peoples and
   communities have developed contradictory aspects, among which we find
   those that speak of its impossibility within the framework of national
   law and others that speak of spaces for the generation of new rights.
   From a critical approach to multi-culturalism and the law, it is
   possible to put together a scheme that takes into account these
   processes of autonomy. The text analyzes a judicial dispute over the
   autonomy in public budget spending of the community of San Benito
   Palermo in Michoac \& aacute;n. In the case, a focused achievement
   stands out from the appropriation of the means of national law by that
   indigenous communi-ty, which legally incorporated the discourse of its
   historical marginalization, achieving the recognition of its autonomy.},

Abstract = {Art school curriculums in institutional settings are often irrelevant to
   the lived experiences, pathways, and histories of Black students. In
   this context, in Summer 2021 and 2022, Artspace gallery manager Joshua
   Vettivelu stewarded a series of projects centring Black students,
   creating space for open exploration through residencies and research
   supported by peer mentorship. These projects mobilized a durational
   approach, pairing small groups of students with slightly more
   experienced peer mentors over an extended period, in an environment
   underscored with care and self-direction. In 2021, the it's real because
   it happened residency and exhibit allowed participants to explore
   questions of self-portraiture and perception in collaboration. In 2022,
   The Black Creative Research Residency (BCRR) project paired a working
   artist, Shaya Ishaq, with three students to explore questions of optical
   allyship and Black resistance, culminating in the Knowable Archives,
   Unknowable Vessels exhibit. This exploration of optical allyship raised
   questions about allyship communicated through (sometimes shallow) visual
   signifiers, and in particular explored the works of David Drake - an
   enslaved potter working in the Antebellum South known for engraving his
   pots with poetry and his signature - and Josiah Wedgwood - a British
   potter who made abolitionist pendants for The Society for Effecting the
   Abolition of Slave Trade. This paper highlights the best practices that
   emerged from these residencies, such as providing both material
   resources and immaterial - that is to say, intellectual and relational -
   support through caring mentorship and relationship building.
   Furthermore, we explore the tension between both possibilities and
   limitations of radical care and Black creative practices within
   institutional constraints.},

Abstract = {Even in the weakest, most war-torn states, remarkably peaceful regions
   exist. We posit that the emergence of regions with comparatively high
   levels of security depends on the presence of bounded rulers. Bounded
   rulers hail from a dominant local group that is a minority at the
   national level, which bounds their political careers within a given
   region. Because of their limited upward mobility, they govern with a
   long time horizon and can guarantee protection to their population in
   return for information and support for the regional government. To test
   this theory, we leverage interviews with local elites in Afghanistan,
   Iraq, and Somalia; an original data set on governors in these countries;
   and a difference-in-differences estimation. The evidence supports our
   theory: bounded rulers significantly reduce local violence during their
   tenures. The findings suggest that donors could use targeted aid to
   support regional solutions to insecurity in fragile states.},

Abstract = {From the very origins of our autonomous state, two differentiated and
   incompatible visions of those essential features on which our
   constitutional model of territorial decentralization of power would be
   mainly based were put on the table. Two visions that have been equally
   present, and in dispute, in the development of other decentralization
   systems in our western environment, and which can be reconduced to the
   concepts of dual federalism and cooperative/coercive federalism. From
   the Constitutional Court's interpretation of our model, it can be
   deduced that the degree of autonomous self-government is variable and
   dynamic, since what the autonomous communities can or cannot do will
   depend on how the central State has exercised its constitutional powers
   in practice.},

   Antinomies of Liberal Democracy?},
Journal = {POLITOLOGIJA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {113},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-103},
Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyze Roberto Mangabeira Unger's
   theory of empowered democracy and to evaluate it with regard to
   antinomies of liberal thought as formulated by the author himself. This
   article discusses the main presumptions of Unger's political philosophy
   and his conceptualization of politics. The theory of empowered democracy
   is analyzed as an attempt to overcome the antinomy of the universal and
   the particular, which permeates the liberal worldview. Unger criticizes
   liberal thought and its central components-liberal psychology and
   ethics. This critique of liberalism serves as a basis for the
   philosopher's vision of politics, at the centre of which is an
   emancipated and autonomous individual. ``Negative capability{''}, which
   is the power of individuals to review and rebuild their social contexts,
   helps them create a political order, which aims to create a ``bigger
   life for all{''}. To empower individuals, Unger offers a wideranging set
   of changes-starting with more plasticity in political institutions and
   ending with political protection of the individual ensured by ``immunity
   rights{''} and prevention of ``false necessities{''}. This article aims
   to show that Unger's theory ultimately fails in this goal due to
   contradictions between the theory of empowered democracy and the
   author's own conception of politics as well as due to questionable
   sustainability of such solution.},

Abstract = {Many citizen decision-making bodies, from juries to boards, have the
   potential to represent racial minority views because they must
   deliberate and decide unanimously. However, little is known about the
   effects of racial diversity on group decisions. Existing studies use
   observational data, include too few people of color (POCs), or cannot
   disentangle race and preferences. We study one such body, the civil
   jury, which can check economic actors whose actions disproportionately
   affect minoritized populations. We analyze 2,694 citizens randomly
   assigned to 449 mock juries tasked with deciding punitive damages
   against corporations. The number of POCs on a jury affects private
   opinions, even accounting for other group and individual
   characteristics. However, group decisions are less affected, because POC
   dissenters carry less influence than White dissenters: POCs can change
   minds more easily than votes. Deliberation and veto power do not
   eliminate racial barriers to substantive representation.},

Title = {REGION AS A ``DOUBLE PERIPHERY{''} (ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE RUSSIAN FAR
   EAST)},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The study of ``double peripheries{''} is a new area of center-periphery
   research, the development of which is currently hampered by several
   methodological difficulties, including the problems of conceptualization
   and empirical interpretation of the ``double periphery{''} as a
   scientific concept. Citing Russian Far East as an example, the article
   attempts to provide methodologically founded identification of a
   specific double periphery. Drawing on the results of contemporary
   center-periphery studies, the paper advances a working definition of a
   double periphery. This allows for identifying statistical indicators
   that are necessary to assess whether a socio-geographical object belongs
   to the peripheries of the named type. After that the author conducts a
   comparative historical analysis of quantitative data on the societal
   potential of the Russian Far East in 1990-2020 and the dynamics of its
   trade, investment and migration ties. The analysis concludes that the
   macroregion represents a double periphery which has developed in the
   post-Soviet period in relation to the NEA-3 countries (China, Japan, the
   Republic of Korea) and Russia. Today it is most clearly manifested in
   the export of goods and outbound tourism. Finally, the article outlines
   possible ways to stimulate development of the Far Eastern macroregion
   under the objective constraints imposed by its peripheral position. The
   implication to be made is that it is necessary to move from the
   selective policy of local preferences, which has been carried out since
   the beginning of the 2010s, to the areal planned development of the
   Russian Far East based on the introduction of a special administrative
   regime on the its territory.},

Title = {THEORY OF WORLD POLITICS: ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL FOR TRANSFER},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {2},
Pages = {38-49},
Abstract = {In international studies, there are many borrowings from other
   disciplines at the level of metaphors, concepts, etc. In this regard,
   the question is raised about a possible reverse transfer, i.e. from the
   sphere of world politics to other scientific spheres, including not only
   socio-humanitarian, but also the natural sciences. The article analyzes
   a successful example of such a transfer given by R. Axelrod in the early
   2000s, as well as subsequent attempts to theoretically validate the
   conditions for export from the field of international studies to other
   areas. Two approaches have been identified. Within the framework of the
   first approach, it is proposed to create an interdisciplinary theory,
   since international relations are able to integrate various humanitarian
   and social disciplines. The second approach allows for a
   ``pluralistic{''} and ``blurred{''} subject field of the theory of
   international relations, in which various theoretical and methodological
   lines can coexist and enter into discussion with each other (societal
   multiplicity), rather than remain isolated. It provides opportunities
   for its ``export{''} to other scientific fields. A critical analysis of
   these approaches allows us to conclude that in both the first and second
   cases, the political focus of international research is lost. The
   article substantiates the subject area of world politics as the exertion
   of political influence in the international arena by state and non-state
   actors. Based on this, the authors of the article put forward a third
   direction. The essence of it is that the search for the possibility of
   exporting from international research to other scientific fields does
   not lie in the creation of an interdisciplinary theory, and not in the
   formation of a ``blurred{''} subject field that ensures ``societal
   multiplicity{''}, but in the similarity of the situations under
   consideration. The authors show that the degree of similarity of
   situations depends on a number of factors, including the behavior of
   actors/objects being in conditions that are relatively the same.
   Examples are given by comparing situations and theoretical concepts of
   international relations and world politics with situations and concepts
   in other scientific fields - meteorology, medicine, ethology. At the
   same time, the place of the ``political{''} in other spheres is occupied
   by the dominant object/factor.},

Abstract = {A vast literature documents growing ideological divisions between the
   parties in the contemporary U.S. Congress based on estimates revisit
   theoretical and empirical claims about the nature of partisan
   polarization by addressing concerns raised in recent scholarship about
   the comparability and interpretation of roll-call estimates over time.
   We leverage data from candidate surveys that allow us to hold the policy
   agenda constant from 1996 to 2008. We show that the replacement of
   relatively moderate legislators with more ideologically extreme
   legislators, particularly among Republicans, explains virtually all of
   the recent growth in partisan polarization. We further demonstrate that
   these patterns are explained mostly by increased polarization over
   social and environmental issues and link our findings to changes in the
   congressional agenda. Our results have important substantive and
   methodological implications for evaluating sources of legislative
   polarization and using roll-call measures in empirical applications.},

Abstract = {Between 37 and 63\% of the logged timber in Peru has an illegal origin.
   This study aims to describe this supply chain in Ucayali region. The
   main contribution is the elaboration (and diagramming) of a sequence of
   processes, activities, and tasks (supported by the collection of
   management documents, field interviews and observation, based on the
   crime -script methodology), and the identification of mechanisms of
   evasion of environmental, tax and labour controls which explain the
   illegal origin. The severe gap between the supply chain and the
   regulatory structure developed by the State shows formal instruments
   supported by declarative mechanisms that lead to proposing the idea of a
   State that performs control, carrying out a formal theatricalization of
   surveillance, while assuming the existence of a widespread illegal
   logic.},

   (HAA) {[}Magyar M \& udblac;v \& eacute;szeti Akad \& eacute;mia], a
   flagship institution in Orb \& aacute;n's Hungary that has not been
   previously researched. To understand the Academy's mental and material
   processes in tandem, I mobilize Antonio Gramsci's concept of common
   sense. With this concept, I approach the Academy's ``popular conception
   of the world{''}. With the help of ethnographic methods, I aim to study
   the heart of the state and analyze its power relations. The article
   argues that as much as the political economy of the regime, its ideas
   are full of paradoxes. These controversies do not stem from incompetence
   but from the contradictions of capitalism. Therefore, the article points
   out that the ideas of right-wing intellectuals are far from a coherent
   ideology. Institutions such as HAA consolidate these ideas into a messy
   mixture of common sense. In the case of HAA, the organizing principle of
   common sense is the feeling that right-wing artists were oppressed
   before Orb \& aacute;n returned to power in 2010, but they can now
   fulfill their vocation. By emphasizing how the beliefs and ideas of
   right-wing actors fuel an authoritarian capitalist regime, I bring three
   contributions to the literature. First, I demonstrate how the worldview
   of HAA is rooted in the past inequalities of post-socialism. Second, I
   go beyond the image of top-down propaganda and stress that the
   incoherence of common sense emerges from the regime's internalized
   contradictions. Third, I draw attention to the role of the state and its
   intellectuals in orchestrating the common sense to normalize the local
   regime of capital accumulation. As a result, the article claims that
   right-wing intellectuals should be neither demonized nor idealized, but
   their ideas must be considered along with their pasts and the regime
   they craft.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on a heterodox approach from Latin American Marxist
   political theory, in the search to understand the sociopolitical limits
   of the reformist proposal of the Petro government. To advance this
   purpose, it includes nationalist postulates advanced by the Bolivian
   sociologist Ren \& eacute; Zavaleta and continued by the philosopher
   Luis Tapia, which expand the Gramscian aspect by placing it in the
   regional political and historical context. The text develops in two
   moments, the first establishes a set of conceptual relationships from
   which cultural and sociological inertias are explored, inscribed in the
   historical process of constitution of Colombian society, showing certain
   intersections with the development of capitalism in the country. In a
   second moment, political dynamics are broadly characterized that
   establish a social equation that, although it suffered from the recent
   political crisis, made manifest in the social outbreak, displays its
   stubborn historical burden, preventing the generation of social
   availability that can promote the joint and comprehensive development of
   the reforms proposed by the first progressive experience in government.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the causes of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
   Neoclassical realism is the theoretical framework for this task, and
   geopolitics is the analytical instrument. The research focuses on the
   perceptions of the Russian ruling elite and, more specifically, on their
   geographic mental map to examine how they interpreted the Ukrainian
   approach to the West. In this way, it intends to analyzethe reasons that
   led Russian rulers to invade Ukraine. To do so, it explains the
   evolution of Ukrainian foreign policy in the last decades. Moreover, it
   addresses Russia's great power status ambitions and how this goal takes
   shape in a specific geographic mental map, constituting the framework
   that Russian leaders use to process international events. In order to
   clarify the mental map of the Russian elite, the article draws on
   sources in Russian, addressing public statements of members of the
   Russian government, government advisers' analyses, and Russian foreign
   policy. It helps understand how Russian foreign policymakers perceived
   Ukrainian foreign policy and its western orientation.},

Journal = {DESAFIOS},

Abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of the global market and the need to stand
   out in an increasingly competitive environment, countries choose to
   transform themselves into attractive consumer products through their
   country brands. In 2005, during the \& Aacute;lvaro Uribe
   administration, the Colombia is Passion campaign was launched with the
   objective of promoting a new image of the country at the global level.
   The objective of this research was to identify the aesthetic and
   ideological forms that given through the national identity discourse of
   this brand. A qualitative study was developed based on a hermeneutic
   method and a retrospective approach. A semi-structured interview guide
   was applied to 24 participants. The data were systematized and analyzed
   through Nvivo 12. It was found that Colombia is Passion was based on the
   reproduction of the belief system of a professional elite through
   processes of aestheticization of politics in the public space, which was
   apprehended, internalized, and reproduced again by the individual,
   structuring a discourse of national identity based on passion. This
   research attests to the principle of originality by starting with an
   innovative proposal that proposes a different perspective in the
   approach to the Country Brand phenomenon},

Title = {``They can't cope{''}: Youth Self-injury and Risk Discourse in Canadian
   News Media},
Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {533-551},
Abstract = {Epidemics of self-injury are increasingly framed as public health crises
   and risk facing youth in Canada. This article examines the discursive
   construction of youth self-injury as risk in mainstream Canadian news
   articles through a neoliberal governmentality framework. It argues that
   self-injury risk discourses are consistent with neoliberal mental health
   paradigms, which individualize and depoliticize distress while
   responsibilizing individuals for recovery and wellbeing. The
   construction of youth self-injury in terms of risk simultaneously
   undergirds the surveillance, regulation, and coercive control of
   self-injuring subjects. Based on a critical discourse analysis of
   Canadian news articles addressing the problem of youth self-injury, this
   article identifies and discusses three interrelated themes from study
   findings: social (media) contagion, failed resilience, and system
   overwhelm. Ultimately, it suggests that the construction of self-injury
   in terms of risk frames self-injuring youth as failed neoliberal
   subjects. Risk discourses are therefore incompatible with social justice
   paradigms in mental health.},

Abstract = {Francisco Rubio Llorente was not only a theoretical constitutionalist,
   but also a practical one. As General Secretary of The Congress of
   Deputies during the years 1978 and 1979, he played an unquestionable
   role in its organization and functioning as a democratic chamber during
   the Transition and the Constituent Process; as magistrate, and later
   President of the Constitutional Court, he played a key role in the
   development of this important body. His intellectual work not only laid
   the foundation of modern constitutional Law, it also contributed
   decisively in creating a school formed around his figure, characterized
   by rigour in knowledge, critical spirit in debates, tolerance without
   any kind of sectarism, and, of course, independence of judgement.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The purpose of the article is to analyze the narratives of female
   university students belonging to feminist collectives, evidencing the
   discourses and norms that support their social practices from cultural
   breaks and continuities, positioning them as subjects of sociopolitical
   transformations. The research is carried out from a qualitative approach
   through an intertextual methodology of analysis of the stories obtained
   through semi-structured interviews applied to discussion groups. The
   participants are university women who belong to university feminist
   groups from higher education institutions in the various regions of the
   country that actively participated in the feminist May 2018. The results
   of the research refer to their own understanding of Chilean university
   feminist groups valuing themselves as historical and political subjects
   who have provoked a revolution in Chilean university spaces denouncing
   gender violence and building safer spaces for future generations. At the
   same time, the collectives are seen as an instance of empowerment of
   women who carry out socio-political advocacy in order to contribute to
   the construction of a more egalitarian and equitable Chilean society.},

Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the phenomenon of teleworking. It studies the link
   between its predominance and the degree of digital development achieved,
   while providing different measurements. The study highlights the main
   socioeconomic effects of teleworking, such as its impact on
   productivity, the degree of job satisfaction, work-life balance or
   environmental sustainability. It also highlights the problems
   encountered with the existing measurements. The approach in this study
   is a quantitative one and it has been achieved through the collection
   and analysis of statistical data from various official sources and
   available researches. The temporal reference corresponds to the period
   marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, where it has been examined the
   evolution prior to the health crisis and the most recent data. From the
   spatial point of view, the study focuses on the context of the European
   Union, and in particular, Spain. Among the results obtained, it is noted
   the importance of human capital to explain the different impact of
   teleworking in the European countries.Keywords:ICT sector; Digital

   research, this article aims at studying the power stratification of
   Italian civil society-third sector through a systematic analysis of the
   distribution of three specific types of resources, namely organisational
   resources, reputation, and public visibility. For this purpose, we
   combine three methodological approaches. The study firstly draws on a
   large-scale mapping of civil society organizations and leaders at
   national level and follows the so-called ``positional method{''}. The
   second approach that we adopt in this study is the reputational
   analysis, based on a national survey conducted in 2021 which targeted
   680 civil society leaders of organisations based on the same mapping of
   the positional approach. The third approach is the claims-making
   analysis, which consists in retrieving CS actors' interventions on a
   given issue in the public domain drawing from media sources. Through the
   combination of these three methodological approaches, the study
   highlights the stratification of Italian civil society and the multi-
   dimensionality of power and influence among Italian Civil society
   elites. It also shows how the distribution of power resources lays on
   three main types of leaders-elites: the organizational leader, the
   renowned leader and the charismatic leader.},

   Transitional economies},
Journal = {SIYASAL-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Corruption affects many economic, political, and social indicators
   directly and indirectly. One of the economic costs of corruption is a
   decrease in tax revenues. In societies where corruption is high,
   administrators taking bribes for excess revenue may reduce tax
   administration performance. Therefore, corruption and taxes are closely
   related to each other. This study analyzes the impact of corruption on
   different tax types in 6 selected transition economies (Estonia, Czech
   Republic, Hungary, Poland, Latvia and Slovak Republic) in the 1998-2021
   and Bootstrap Panel Granger causality method. According to this study,
   there is unidirectional causality from personal income tax to corruption
   in Slovakia, from corporate tax and VAT to corruption in Poland, from
   VAT and SCT to corruption in Hungary, and from VAT to corruption in
   Latvia. Additionally, there is a bidirectional causal relationship from
   corruption to personal income tax in Poland and from corruption to
   corporate tax in the Czech Republic and Hungary, but there is no causal
   relationship between corruption and VAT and SCT. Personal income and
   corporate taxes, which require a strong relationship between tax
   administration and taxpayers, are more affected by corruption than taxes
   such as VAT and SCT.},

Abstract = {Through an analysis of personal histories, we reflect on changes in
   disability discourses in educational contexts since the 1970s. We argue
   that educational systems are deeply resistant to critical discourse of
   disability even while espousing social justice principles. We
   simultaneously recognize the disconnection between disability,
   education, and the lived experiences of disabled children, and the way
   in which their experiences are framed. We call for a more integrated
   discourse between academic theories of disability, professional systems,
   and children's lived experiences in order to better care for children
   and their families, and to address injustice in education systems.},

Abstract = {As automation challenges labour markets across Europe, research in
   political science is pointing towards the socially corrosive link
   between such technological change and political dissatisfaction. In this
   paper, I extend this research agenda by looking at the relation between
   automation risk and incumbent support in 20 European countries between
   2012 and 2018. I find strong support for the notion that workers with
   substantial exposure to automation risk are more likely to reject
   governments at the ballot box. Importantly, however, these findings
   indicate that this anti-incumbent voting is less prevalent among
   theoretically at-risk workers who enjoy some level of protection, in the
   form of permanent contracts, co-determination rights or higher
   educational attainment. As such, this paper argues that technological
   occupation risk should be seen as feeding into broader labour market
   risks faced by voters.},

Title = {THE REFORM OF THE COMMON EUROPEAN ASYLUM SYSTEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE
   IMPLEMENTATION THE EU PRINCIPLE OF SOLIDARITY},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},

Pages = {149-162},
Abstract = {The polycrisis in the European Union has a great influence on the issue
   of solidarity. The events of recent years demonstrate a significant lack
   of solidarity within the EU. At the same time, solidarity is one of the
   principles of the Union's immigration and asylum policy, as well as one
   of its key value. For a long time, it was assumed that all member states
   act in the spirit of mutual solidarity, which should flow from the very
   fact of a country's membership in the EU. In other words, international
   solidarity within the Union is based on voluntariness, which does not
   require any special mechanism for its implementation. However, in recent
   years, this presumption has shown its inconsistency, and as a result,
   the idea has arisen to create a special solidarity mechanism. The
   migration crisis of 2015 forced the institutions of the Union to start
   reforming the Common European Asylum System, a key element of which is
   the creation of an effective solidarity mechanism within the Union. This
   article is devoted to the study of the transformation of the solidarity
   principle in the framework of the reform of the Common European Asylum
   System. The article highlights the main stages of the protracted reform
   of asylum legislation, reveals the key features of each stage from a
   solidarity perspective. The author comes to the conclusion that the
   proposed asylum system in the EU will not become fairer and will not
   ensure the implementation of the principle of solidarity. At the same
   time, the reform of the asylum policy could lead to an increase in the
   centralization of this policy and the expansion of the powers of the
   Union bodies, which will not make it possible to resolve the current
   problems and provide solidarity. Thus, solidarity will turn out to be
   only a tool in the hands of the institutions of the Union for carrying
   out planned reforms. According to the author, at the moment one can
   observe the transformation of solidarity within the EU into
   collectivism, when the interests of the Union are put above the
   interests of the member states, and the latter are forced to follow a
   common policy against their will.},

Title = {Costly Signaling and China's Strategic Engagement in Arctic Regional
   Governance},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {In recent years, China has become an increasingly important actor in
   Arctic regional governance. While Beijing consistently frames its
   engagement in the region as a strategy of mutually-beneficial
   cooperation, some Arctic countries have raised significant concerns
   about its growing economic presence, warning that China may leverage its
   geopolitical influence to change the existing norms and rules in the
   polar region. Facing the mounting ``China threat{''} skepticism, what
   are Beijing's coping strategies to belie concerns? Based on a review of
   the existing research and government documents, particularly
   Chinese-language scholarly works and official reports, this article
   specifically identifies two types of costly signaling approaches
   employed by China to reduce Arctic countries' distrust. First, China has
   started to curtail its Arctic investment in oil, gas, and mining while
   engaging more in sectors that chime well with Western societies' global
   environmental values, including clean and renewable energy, ecological
   research that addresses further climatic change associated with global
   warming, and other environmentally sustainable industries.},

Abstract = {The Russian invasion at the beginning of 2022 forced many Ukrainians to
   find refuge in safer places. Using unique survey data collected in the
   early days of the war, this research note turns to Ukrainian refugees'
   opinions in two host countries: Germany and Poland. We are interested in
   how this - otherwise hard-to-reach und so far understudied - group of
   people evaluated their country's potential European Union (EU) accession
   at that very specific moment in time, whether there existed differences
   in perceptions between the interviewees in the two countries, and what
   the predictors might have been. Overall, our findings indicate that the
   Ukrainian refugees interviewed generally supported Ukraine's accession
   to the EU, with no significant differences observed between the two host
   countries. Furthermore, both utilitarian and identity-driven factors
   played minor roles in shaping support for a future EU membership. These
   insights are not only valuable for academic research but also hold
   relevance for political stakeholders at both national and EU level.},

Abstract = {The political science literature has extensively analyzed the political
   influence of interest groups in recent years. Despite growing scholarly
   interest into their role in agenda-setting, a significant blind spot
   remains in understanding their control over non-decisionmaking. This
   lack of insight into interest groups' negative agenda-setting influence
   is primarily due to three fundamental challenges in research design:
   conceptualization, sampling, and measurement. This paper addresses these
   hurdles and proposes potential solutions to overcome them. It
   subsequently demonstrates the applicability of these recommendations
   within the empirical setting of the European Union. Overall, this paper
   shows that, despite the inherent difficulties in studying interest
   groups' ability to keep their `nightmare' issues off the agenda, these
   challenges can be overcome, providing valuable insights into this
   crucial aspect of political behavior.},

Title = {Selling their vote expensively: The effects of information, apathy and
   age},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 27},
Abstract = {People's attitudes towards vote buying have often been studied through
   the lenses of its acceptability as a norm in society or the drivers
   behind the decision to accept money if offered. However, we know little
   about the financial value that voters attach to their vote. To fill this
   gap in the literature, this research note analyzes what makes people
   accept different sums of money in exchange for their votes. It uses a
   survey conducted in Romania after the 2020 legislative elections and
   shows that most respondents reject any sum of money. Among those willing
   to accept money, the voters who have limited information, who rarely
   participate politically and those who are young are inclined to ask
   higher sums for their vote. Partisanship has mild effects, but poverty
   and trust in parties do not make a difference.},

   Turkey},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 21},
Abstract = {How does pre-electoral terrorist violence affect the results of an
   election? One of the various ways terrorism can influence election
   outcomes is through manipulation of the voting behavior in localities
   where attacks occur. The literature finds that incumbents are
   electorally punished in target areas. The effects of terrorism on the
   fortunes of political parties associated with the insurgents, observed
   in many electoral democracies, however, are under-studied. Examining the
   two general elections that took place in Turkey in 2015, I analyze the
   effects of Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) attacks against civilian and
   combatant targets during the 5-month period between the two elections on
   the electoral performances of the incumbent Justice and Development
   Party (AKP) and the insurgent-associated Peoples' Democratic Party
   (HDP). I argue that the localized effects of pre-electoral terrorist
   violence on electoral outcomes is mediated by the existing electoral
   support for the insurgent-associated political party. The results
   demonstrate that violence helps this party in its support zone, while it
   works for the incumbent elsewhere; but the incumbent is held accountable
   for attacks against civilians by electorates in all areas. I conclude
   that further disaggregation of the target types will further enhance our
   understanding of how terrorist violence affects election outcomes.},

Title = {Fichte's global material constitution},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 16},
Abstract = {The article shows that Fichte's conception of human rights implies
   concrete guidelines for the economic organization of states and
   international relations. First, I elucidate Fichte's view on human
   rights at the domestic level. Fichte's complex theory of human rights
   consists in a meta-right to live in a state that secures at least two
   ``original rights{''}: a right to bodily inviolability and a right to
   sufficient property. I focus on the latter. Due to Fichte's unorthodox
   view of property rights as rights to actions rather than objects, this
   amounts to a right to work. This right, according to Fichte, must be
   realized in a planned economy. Second, I focus on the global level.
   Fichte's right to sufficient (unorthodox) property has implications for
   three dimensions of global justice: cosmopolitan right, the right of
   nations and commercial relations. Third, I draw some insights from
   thinking through Fichte's global material constitution for long observed
   conceptual tensions regarding his political and legal philosophy, namely
   between freedom and security as well as cosmopolitanism and nationalism,
   and for current debates in politics and political theory.},

Abstract = {Civil society organizations (CSO) engaged in food systems work have
   grown substantially in number, scale, and scope. Many of these CSOs are
   seizing opportunities to engage with the globalized industrial food
   system in efforts to promote greater equity and sustainability and have
   realized that addressing issues at a systemic level demand engaging with
   governance. Despite increasing scholarly attention to food systems and
   to CSO engagement with governments, the diversity of governance
   arrangements remains understudied. In this paper, we explore the
   meanings and perspectives of food systems governance from the standpoint
   of CSOs leaders across Canada and Indigenous territories. Drawing on 70
   semi-structured interviews, we argue that CSOs play a central role in
   advancing food systems governance by how they frame and act on food
   issues. We point to CSOs understandings and engagement with food systems
   governance as broader and more nuanced than what has previously been
   documented in the literature. A more discerning and comprehensive
   understanding of how CSO actors describe and advance food systems
   governance helps articulate how CSOs are scaling-up place-based work,
   modelling new forms of governance, and ultimately, impacting
   decision-making structures.},

Abstract = {As disasters become more frequent and costly, understanding attitudes
   toward government disaster policy becomes critically important. Scholars
   have explored the racialized nature of specific disasters such as
   Hurricane Katrina. But studies of general disaster policy preferences
   have not attended much to race, focusing instead on dimensions like
   partisanship and perceived deservingness. We use two original national
   surveys to assess the role of racial attitudes and ethnoracial
   identification on support for disaster spending. We find that racial
   attitudes are among the most powerful predictors of disaster spending
   preferences. They also strongly condition support for racially-targeted
   reasons justifying disaster spending. We also find that support for
   disaster spending is highest among Black Americans and lowest among
   Whites. Racial attitudes account for much of this racial gap, and
   strongly predict preferences even with controls for political attitudes,
   experience with disaster, and demographics. Our findings hold across
   question wordings and time. Racial attitudes are important in
   understanding general preferences about disaster policy, beyond
   responses to the specific racialized disasters on which scholars of race
   and disaster have focused.},

Abstract = {We examine the changing patterns of knowledge production and diffusion
   in political science over the past five decades using a dataset of over
   200,000 SSCI-indexed research articles from 1970 to 2020. We analyze how
   author identity and team diversity influence research outputs and
   outcomes. The results show that historically excluded groups of scholars
   have gradually improved their representation and expanded their
   collaboration networks over time. Although the publication gaps are
   narrowing, obscured gaps in evaluation and citation practices persist.
   Research specialties with higher proportions of minority researchers
   tend to have lower average citation impacts. The least cited research
   specialties are largely studied by women and racial/ethnic minority
   scholars. Papers written by racial/ethnic minorities and Global South
   scholars are significantly less cited. However, collaborating without
   group scholars can effectively overcome this citation gap. We also find
   that papers written by women receive more citations than those written
   by men, after controlling for journal prestige and research topics.
   Furthermore, when we limit our investigation toleading universities,
   citation gaps diminish. However, scholars of African descent continue to
   experience entrenched citationdisadvantages even if they are affiliated
   with highly prestigious universities. This study provides
   multidimensional measurements toadvance diversity debates and adds
   nuances to our understanding of opportunity structures in political

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 10},
Abstract = {What effect does power personalization have on authoritarian policy
   outcomes? While existing literature expects personalist rulers to
   substitute private handouts or personal whims for coherent policymaking,
   I identify two mechanisms - elimination of veto players and establishing
   institutional control over the bureaucracy - through which
   personalization can serve as a permissive condition for autocracies
   adopting public policies that benefit mass constituencies within
   society. Focusing on a clear case of personalization in Saudi Arabia, I
   demonstrate that these proposed mechanisms have contributed to the
   policy achievements of the Vision 2030 reform programme. Policy outcomes
   under de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman thus point to a more
   complicated relationship between personalization and policymaking under
   authoritarianism than predicted by existing literature. This article has
   implications for how we study authoritarian policymaking and the
   research questions we ask about personalization.},

Abstract = {Although, in many countries, the military is the most trusted state
   institution, we know little about public trust in the military outside
   the United States. We argue that, for the military, trust is grounded in
   its legitimation as, and aspiration to be, non-partisan. From this
   insight, we develop hypotheses regarding the relationship between trust
   in the military and other institutions, the military's centrality to
   political power, intrastate conflict, and recruitment format. Using
   cross-national data (2006-2021), we find support for these hypotheses.
   Falling trust in partisan state institutions benefits the armed forces.
   When the military exercises influence over politics, at odds with its
   legitimation, it is judged by the usual standards of government
   performance. Civil wars convert the military into a factional actor, and
   public trust falls. When militaries recruit via selective conscription,
   confidence suffers. These findings have important implications for
   civil-military relations, military effectiveness, and democratic
   stability.},

Abstract = {The datasets on the Italian political class provides two sets of
   information: (a) census data on a broad spectrum of individual-level
   variables on elected politicians, offering an updated mapping of the
   characteristics of more than 20,000 Italian representatives at all
   governmental levels; (b) survey data on politicians' attitudes towards
   elections, participation, public opinion, several national and
   international policy issues, and their views of political
   representation. Between September 2020 and January 2021, 2134 elected
   politicians at the local (n = 1917), regional (n = 128), national (n =
   75) and European (n = 14) levels were interviewed, making this one of
   the largest surveys of the Italian political elites ever conducted and a
   valuable resource for researchers interested in the study of democratic
   representation.},

Abstract = {Guatemala experienced a brutal internal armed conflict between 1960 and
   1996. The conflict took on genocidal overtones in several autochthon
   regions, including the Maya Ixil area, where the author of this article
   conducted a year-long ethnographic field study as part of her doctoral
   thesis in social anthropology. The policies put in place as part of the
   counterinsurgency struggle undermined both the Ixil culture and its
   language, the use of which was banned in certain areas controlled by the
   army. Following the conflict, several associations sought justice for
   these various acts, and in 2013, a trial was opened against the
   country's former genocidal dictator. As part of this trial, witnesses
   were assisted by interpreters who simultaneously translated their
   accounts from Ixil into Spanish. Based on the testimony of a woman who
   was raped during the armed conflict, this author examines the linguistic
   negotiations that take place in a transitional justice tribunal and
   analyzes the effects of these negotiations on the memory of individual
   traumatic episodes and on their dissemination as narratives of a
   collective traumatic memory. Finally, by analyzing the different ways in
   which the experience of rape is expressed, this article sheds light on
   the changes in language that take place in the context of a trial, thus
   provoking broader questions about the way in which cultural differences
   are included in this type of space.},

   notes on the notion of ``progress{''} within critical theory},
Journal = {PENSAMIENTO AL MARGEN},

Number = {19},

Month = {DEC-APR},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyse the notion of ``progress{''} within
   the tradition of Frankfurt School's critical theory of society. The
   starting thesis is that both the radical critics of modern progress
   (Benjamin, Adorno, Horkheimer) and their contemporary defenders
   (Habermas, Honneth) maintain an insufficiently complex view of the
   meaning of the modernization process. In order to defend this thesis, I
   divide the work into three sections. First, I sketch two very schematic
   stories of the meaning of the modernization process. Second, I
   synthesize the position of those representatives of critical theory who,
   taking the side of the first story, have offered a markedly optimistic
   theory of social evolution. Finally, I give a brief overview of the
   critiques of modernity and the notion of progress that can be located
   within critical theory, focusing on those that constitute its most
   impressive reflective culmination: Benjamin's theses on the philosophy
   of history and Adorno and Horkheimer's Dialectic of Enlightenment.},

Abstract = {What motivates property owners to pay taxes in places where state
   enforcement is weak? Using an online experiment among property owners in
   Lagos, Nigeria, we evaluate the effectiveness of different appeals at
   increasing respondents' tax morale-willingness to pay taxes absent
   enforcement-and attitudes about government enforcement of tax
   collection. Respondents were randomly assigned to read either a vignette
   emphasizing the role of property tax revenues in contributing to
   economic growth and increased property values or one highlighting that
   tax revenues are used for public goods and services benefiting all
   residents. The growth and property values message made respondents
   significantly more favorable toward enforcement of tax collection, but
   there was no difference in willingness to pay between the two
   conditions.},

Abstract = {This article contends that liberty was already a globally connected
   concept during the late Middle Ages, and the Euro-American Enlightenment
   conception of liberty was only one of the many products of the global
   medieval legacies. Developing a network approach to concepts and
   applying it to primary sources in ten languages across Afro-Eurasia, I
   map how thinkers from different parts of the world contributed to the
   formation of the network. Recognizing this global network of liberty
   allows researchers to rediscover overlooked conceptualizations of
   liberty-as evidenced by examples of the Mongol Empire and its
   translingual politics with/in Europe, Persia, and China. Once
   innovations in specific contexts are placed back into the global
   network, revealed are global patterns of valorizing liberty, considering
   it either essential to possess or warranting caution. Both the findings
   and methodologies presented here prompt scholars to revisit the
   foundations of modern political thought from a global standpoint.},

Abstract = {The mainstreaming of the far-right worldwide has immense societal
   effects, one of the main being the normalization of `far-right talking
   points', quotidian expressions of far-right worldviews existing well
   beyond the political proponents of this ideology. Our piece tries to
   explore the effects of far-right talking points in the environmental
   domain. We do so by utilizing the theoretical concept of microfascism,
   the everyday expressions and practices of societal exclusion and the
   desire for authoritarianism. More specifically, we test the extent to
   which far-right ecologism, the ideological response of the far right to
   an array of environmental problems, operates as a set of arguments
   existing beyond the representatives of this ideology. To do so, we
   conducted a mixed-methods study, consisting of a quantitative survey of
   106 respondents, followed up by 27 semi-structured interviews conducted
   with environmental activists in Serbia, a dynamic and nascent settings
   for environmental activism. Our findings illustrate the methodological
   issue of capturing ideological positioning through diverse methods but
   more fundamentally, the broader implications of far-right talking points
   in the environmental domain.},

Abstract = {While a large body of research explores the federal-level influences
   over distributive politics decisions, very little attention has been
   given to the active role state and local governments play in the
   geographic distribution of federal funds. Before presidents,
   legislators, and agency leaders can influence the selection of federal
   grants, state and local governments must expend time and resources to
   submit grant proposals. We focus on grant applications as our unit of
   analysis and advance a theory that congressional representation
   influences the grant application behavior of state and local
   governments. We analyze US Department of Transportation grant
   applications and awards from 2009 to 2022 and find evidence that
   congressional representation meaningfully influences state-level grant
   application behavior. States apply more aggressively for federal
   transportation grants when represented by senators in the Senate
   majority party, and states apply more efficiently for grants when
   represented by a senator holding an advantageous committee leadership

Abstract = {T his article formulates an original account of the Enlightenment
   through an interpretation of C. L. R. James's The Black Jacobins, a
   landmark work of transatlantic anti-colonial thought. It defends a
   dialectical account of the Enlightenment as a singular transatlantic
   historical process whose content and critical import changes across
   space and time. In The Black Jacobins, James shows the Enlightenment's
   revolutionary and emancipatory political legacy by staging the dialectic
   of the Enlightenment in a colonial situation defined by a
   slave-plantation economy. James illustrates the Enlightenment's
   political legacy as a ``concrete universal{''} that has particular and
   singular aspects, each with its own unique contours. In doing so, the
   article considers other themes at the center of both historical and
   contemporary political theory such as how to best conceptualize
   colonialism; the traveling and misplacement of Enlightened ideas; and
   the critical importance of the dialectical legacy and critical theory in
   these efforts.},

   rule},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 23},
Abstract = {This article explores the phenomenon of plebiscitary rule in
   authoritarian regimes: the institutionalisation and frequent use of
   referendums controlled by the executive. This specific trait of
   dictatorships has not been systematically explored in quantitative
   comparative politics. Our analysis focusses on the combined effect of
   autocratic personalism and regime institutionalised pluralism. The
   puzzle of plebiscitary rule is that it emerges at the intersection of
   these seemingly contradictory forces. We propose that plebiscitary rule
   counterbalances obstruction from the legislative and other
   constitutional actors, contributing to the feasibility of personalist
   rule in electoral authoritarianism. We provide quantitative evidence
   based on every post-1945 autocratic regime that is compatible with our
   expectations.},

   Ideology},

Abstract = {Existing literature sees attitudinal support for liberal democratic
   values as a crucial way to prevent the success of illiberal actors and
   their policies. But recent studies show that democratic support can
   coexist with lack of punishment for backsliding practices. To reconcile
   these findings, I argue that social norms generate incentives to declare
   that one opposes illiberal actors even if one does not-what I call
   staged democrats. Staged democrats are not a stable safeguard against
   illiberal politicians, because information shocks can reveal that they
   do not sincerely oppose illiberalism. Studying Switzerland, where
   referendums provide information on the sincere preferences of citizens,
   I collect data on referendum results, public opinion surveys, and party
   positions. My analyses show that if referendums reveal that the
   positions of far-right parties are more popular than expected, those
   parties become more exclusionary. Attitudes only prevent illiberal
   policy if they are sincerely held.},

Abstract = {The United States has long represented one of Canada's primary
   international allies. This partnership has remained strong despite
   turbulent times in the relationship, such as the one brought forth by
   the Trump presidency. Our article seeks to understand the sources of
   such continuity through the lens of continentalism. While historical
   accounts of continentalism have portrayed it as a passive force stemming
   from Canada's material self-interest, scholars have recently identified
   the emergence of an evolved form of continentalism that represents a
   dominant idea and a coherent analytical framework in Canadian foreign
   policy. Has this new form of continentalism indeed gained widespread
   acceptance among Canadians? We answer this question by considering
   continentalism in the ideational realm. Using novel public opinion data,
   our analysis investigates whether continentalist attitudes have become
   embedded in Canadians' national identity and foster closer alignment
   preferences vis-\& agrave;-vis the United States. We find significant
   and robust evidence of such effects.

Abstract = {How well do existing survey instruments differentiate between opinions
   that affect individual behavior and opinions that don't? To answer this
   question, we randomly assigned U.S. respondents to one of three survey
   instruments: Likert items (Likert), Likert items followed by personal
   importance items (Likert+) and Quadratic Voting for Survey Research
   (QVSR), which gives respondents a fixed budget to buy ``favor{''} or
   ``oppose{''} votes, with the price for each vote increasing
   quadratically. We find that, relative to Likert, both Likert+ and QVSR
   better identify people who care enough about an issue to act in
   opinion-congruent ways, with QVSR offering the most consistent
   improvement overall. Building on these results, we show how conclusions
   regarding the relationship between policy opinions and self-interest can
   differ across measurement strategies.},

   Power of Social Networks},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 8},
Abstract = {This study uses the case of ecological protests in the Russian
   Federation and the social network of 903 263 VKontakte users to
   investigate the unique characteristics of protesters' social networks
   and assess the effects of network topology on the likelihood of
   participation. By applying Bayesian structural equation modeling to the
   data, the study finds that social network topology plays a more nuanced
   and complex role in predicting protest participation beyond simple
   exposure to information. Notably, individuals situated as brokers in
   lower-density and higher-closure networks exhibit a higher likelihood of
   participation, while central nodes participate less. The results
   highlight the importance of strategic positioning as brokers for
   increasing the likelihood of participation. The paper discusses these
   and other findings, contributing to a deeper understanding of the
   interplay between social network structures and protest participation.},

Abstract = {This research explores motivations for political party donations in
   Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ). Drawing on interview data from 29 political
   `insiders,' we utilize McMenamin and Power's theoretical framework to
   assess the pragmatic, partisan and social motivations for donations. We
   extend the original framework beyond business donations, incorporating a
   broader range of donor and non-donor insights. We observe strong social
   motivations for donating and a general agreement among political actors
   that donations provide access to politicians. The theoretical lens is
   expanded by NZ-specific factors, notably a strong concern for democracy
   and the potential for adverse impacts from donating. The latter brings
   negative motivations into the theoretical lens. We offer an amended
   framework that more closely reflects donation motivations in the NZ
   environment, which is dominated by a small pool of large donors, close
   connections between political actors and a desire for adequately funded
   political parties to enhance democratic outcomes.},

Abstract = {Like their urban counterparts, rural local governments' relationships
   with their states have become varied and complex, particularly as rural
   America has become increasingly prominent in state and national
   politics, and the challenges facing rural communities have increased.
   However, a focus on this subset of local governments has been limited in
   scholarship on American federalism. Using survey data of rural local
   governments in Wisconsin, this article examines the degree to which
   rural governments perceive state assistance as helpful in addressing
   community challenges. Results indicate significant support for
   additional state assistance but also concerns about current levels of
   state financial support and state-imposed revenue limitations. Rural
   local governments with greater expenditures, worse financial conditions,
   lower levels of existing state aid, a more agriculture-dependent
   economy, and an older population are more likely to perceive additional
   state assistance as beneficial. Overall, these results provide
   additional clarity on rural local governments' perceptions of-and
   interactions with-their states.},

Abstract = {Though there is strong evidence that nonwhite lawmakers introduce more
   racially salient legislation than white lawmakers, it is less clear
   whether race is a significant predictor of other legislative behavior.
   Given mixed findings in existing research, lawmakers' actions in
   committee offer a new test of how race shapes legislative behavior. I
   develop new, original measures identifying race references in more than
   1.4 million congressional committee hearing statements. I find that
   nonwhite lawmakers discuss race more frequently than white lawmakers in
   hearings, though white lawmakers are more likely to mention race in
   racially diverse hearings due to contact effects. Using a novel measure
   of race-issue bills, I demonstrate that lawmakers' race statements in
   hearings are linked to policy representation. These findings explain how
   racial diversity in legislatures affects legislative speech and policy
   representation.},

Abstract = {This research note presents a new dataset on the French Senate. We
   provide demographic (1968-2017) and electoral (1983-2020) data for all
   Senate districts, biographical and political characteristics for all
   senators who served during the Fifth Republic (1959-2017), and data on
   roll-call votes (RCVs), individual senator's votes in relation to them,
   and the corresponding bill content (1996-2017). In this note, we
   describe the structure of our datasets, provide descriptive information
   on key variables, highlight temporal shifts in ideological trends in the
   French Senate, and discuss possible future research topics. We
   anticipate these data will make an important addition to the rapidly
   growing literature on upper chambers and legislative dynamics.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyze the similarities and differences of the
   concept of nation in Jos \& eacute; Antonio Primo de Rivera, founder and
   leader of Falange Espa \& ntilde;ola, from that used in Vox, a radical
   right party. First, Spanish nationalism is introduced as the main source
   that helps understand the positions of Jos \& eacute; Antonio and Vox.
   Secondly, the concept of nation in Jos \& eacute; Antonio is studied as
   a manifestation of fascist ultranationalism, considering its
   relationship with other elements of Falangist thought, such as the
   empire or the << pending revolution >>. Thirdly, the concept of the
   nation in Vox is exposed, analyzed as a radical right ultranationalism
   based on unitarianism, catholicity and ethnic and cultural homogeneity.
   Finally, the factors of continuity and discontinuity between the fascist
   ultranationalism of Jos \& eacute; Antonio and the radical right
   ultranationalism of Vox are pointed out.},

Abstract = {Recent research in political science has uncovered and theorized about
   inequalities within the field. In this article, we explore a lesser
   publicly discussed difference that likely affects the research process:
   start-up funding. We surveyed assistant professors in US political
   science departments about their start-up packages, and we find that
   characteristics of the institution, prestige of the researcher's PhD
   alma mater, and having competing offers predict receiving a start-up
   fund at all and receiving more research money in that start-up fund. The
   evidence also suggests that women's offers are more sensitive to alma
   mater prestige, with women from the least prestigious alma maters
   receiving less funding than men from similarly ranked schools. Notably,
   publishing more does not seem to help women or men, suggesting that
   women from low-prestige departments in particular cannot work their way
   out of this disadvantage.},

Abstract = {How does regional order change? What is the role of agents' language in

   Contradictory conceptions regarding how ought to be South American
   integration in the xxi century were some of the regional drivers of the
   idea to erect the Pacific Alliance between Colombia, Chile, and Peru.
   The critical discourse analysis highlighted an interaction stage between
   the region and the agencies and the role played by the presidential
   language. The methodology explained the dynamics of discursive
   interaction and the processes between agents-actors-region to
   differentiate themselves from the narratives and practices extrapolated
   in the Other Caribbean and Latin American regional schemes.},

Abstract = {As a collective of inter-cultural women moving in but not of, and
   against and beyond the modern/colonial (neoliberalised) university we
   (t)race generative pedagogical experiences of worldmaking cosmopolitics
   and their (im)possibilities within the University and Politics
   Disciplinarity. We do this not to redeem or reimagine but to contribute
   to an enfleshed feminised and racialised undercommons for whom
   indigenist-decolonial feminist pedagogical-political praxis can never be
   nor desire to be obedient to the constraints, containments and violences
   of the settler colonial and its epistemological-pedagogical genocidal
   project of the Lettered City of anti-Blackness and Indigenous disavowal.
   We refuse inclusion within, representation as legibility, and the making
   of community of and as the University. We instead foreground
   abolitionist categories such as enfleshment, dignity, mutual recognition
   as exteriority, differential responsible relationship-making, multiple
   temporalities and the epistemological as ontological, and we centre the
   knowledges of Indigenist feminised subjects from the exteriority of
   modernity-coloniality. We are thus selective and explicit about who we
   choose to walk with, who we make relationship with, and to whom we are
   responsible and honour. We both guard our right to opacity as well as
   leave threads of pedagogical meaning-making as invitation to unlearning
   and relearning new-ancient onto-epistemologies and cosmovisions that
   move us towards plural pedagogical worlds beyond heteropatriarchal
   capitalist-coloniality.},

Abstract = {When rebel groups transition to electoral parties and participate in the
   democratic process, the prospects of peace are often fragile. We argue
   that rebel parties' capacity to effectively participate in the electoral
   arena and contribute to post-conflict stability is contingent on the
   nature and legacies of the wartime competitive field. Where rebels and
   politicians shared claims of representation over their constituents in
   wartime, we argue that elections-related violence is likely in postwar
   elections when the rebels transition towards political parties. These
   former rebel parties challenges established electoral holds of political
   actors who previously represented the community at the ballot box while
   collaborating with insurgents. The transformation from wartime allies to
   direct electoral competition creates new incentives for violence,
   especially where violence is already normalized. Conversely, where
   established politicians maintain hegemonic representation of their
   constituency, they create strong barriers to entry for former insurgents
   in the electoral realm. As a result, the incentives for violence are
   much reduced. We analyse the Moro Islamic Liberation Front's
   transformation into the United Bangsamoro Justice Party after the
   Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro.},

Abstract = {The argument of this paper is that the experience and performance of joy
   can be a radical and subversive act of pedagogical agency. Although joy
   may seem out of place and out of touch in academia given the increased
   surveillance and policing of what is being taught in the classroom, and
   neoliberal administrative structuring prioritising uniformity and
   outcomes at the expense of creativity, it is here, under this
   oppositional structure, where joy is most subversive precisely because
   it is this dimension of human emotion that is increasingly being crowded
   out and disciplined in universities. Joy, as a positive emotion and
   dimension of wellbeing, has an underappreciated radical dimension only
   appreciable in contrast to its negative or oppositional dimension.
   Although joy has been a theme in pedagogy, its subversive possibilities
   there remain largely unpacked. This paper theorises joy through two
   themes that express its radical possibilities in and beyond the
   classroom. Specifically, joy is a relational and publicly embodied
   affect providing strength for the teacher, inspiration for students, and
   signalling resistance and defiance to structures of oppression. The
   paper concludes by acknowledging the risks and limits of joy that
   nevertheless are outweighed by its sustaining features found in our
   vocation.},

Abstract = {Many believe that weaker legal constraints make unilateral action easier
   to reverse than legislation. Yet in some cases, unilateralism survives a
   successor's determined opposition. I argue that legislative persistence
   and unilateral transience may arise not only from differences in legal
   status but also from a selection effect: unilateralism and subsequent
   rescission can both stem from weak underlying policy-demanding groups.
   But if unilateralism itself alters the landscape of group power through
   policy feedback effects, it can survive a purportedly opposed new
   president. An example is the Trump Administration's failure to depart
   from the Obama Justice Department's lax stance on cannabis. Weak
   constituents' policy demands may thus need to rely on a sympathetic
   president's unilateral action to begin a feedback loop, subsequently
   softening opposition. This paper therefore identifies unilateral action
   as a key tool for shifting policy in an enduring way, explaining its
   success or failure in terms of interest group power.},

Abstract = {It is over 20 years since the publication of the Asymmetric Power Model
   (APM). In the ensuing period, Britain has faced multiple challenges: the
   increasing fragmentation of public services; austerity politics;
   devolution; and, most recently, coronavirus disease and Brexit. It is
   this backdrop which provides the context to this article. First, it
   addresses how the literature has subsequently evolved. It then examines
   what has changed over the last two decades while also emphasizing what
   remains the same. Here, we highlight issues regarding both increased
   inequality and instability, focusing particularly on tension emerging
   from a de-centralizing-recentralizing approach to governance. The
   article concludes by offering a revised APM as a means of understanding
   British politics moving forward.},

   Runoff Election in Zimbabwe},
Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 12},
Abstract = {How, when and where violence is deployed during periods of extreme
   regime crisis is determined by regime support expectations. Regimes use
   political geography to direct violence and ensure political compliance.
   Areas have `core' high regime loyalty, `swing' loyalty where government
   and opposition have supporters, or `costly' and loyalty opposition
   support. During elections, regimes accommodate, suppress or force voters
   in each area. In runoffs, regimes use new information to increase vote
   share in core support areas, and use violence against suspected
   defecting voters. In Zimbabwe during 2008, violence patterns maximised
   the regime's favourable political geography, placing typically safe
   communities in danger.},

Abstract = {Attitudes toward and about democracy have shown a decline in the United
   States and elsewhere. Further, there have been clear indications that
   some elected officials are increasingly willing to forego longstanding
   traditions and norms. A key question is whether the public is
   influencing such elite behavior, or if certain segments are merely
   tolerating it. In other words, is an increase in partisan
   differentiation observed in attitudes toward democracy? If the behavior
   of Republican elected officials in the aftermath of the 2020 election
   was driven in part by constituent demands, we ought to see partisan
   polarization of attitudes about democracy prior to January 2021. In this
   note we trace attitudes about democracy, conditioned on partisanship, to
   examine the extent that such attitudes have polarized in recent decades,
   using data from the American National Election Studies, General Social
   Survey, and World Values Survey from 1996-2020. We find no evidence that
   attitudes toward democracy are meaningfully different across the two
   parties. A subsequent analysis similarly indicates that the winner-loser
   gap has not widened as the parties have polarized over the last 25
   years.},

Abstract = {This article draws upon new data from a recent Economic and Social
   Research Council funded project, Beyond Unionism and Nationalism,1 to
   examine whether electors in Northern Ireland identifying as neither
   nationalist/republican nor unionist/loyalist, the `neithers', desire a
   referendum on Northern Ireland's constitutional status (often labelled a
   border poll) on whether it should remain part of the UK or form part of
   a United Ireland and which of those two options they prefer. With
   surveys of public opinion and election results suggesting there are now
   three minorities in the region, unionists, nationalists and `neithers',
   the views of the lattermost category may be vital in determining the
   arrival and outcome of a referendum. Utilising the largest n (2,045) set
   of face-to-face interviews with `neithers' yet undertaken, the article
   suggests that their low levels of electoral activity extend to a current
   lack of enthusiasm for both an exercise in self-determination and a
   United Ireland. The piece also indicates, however, that national
   identification and religious affiliation are significant attitudinal
   indicators even among a group of electors located beyond the traditional
   bloc divide.},

   Politics, Society, and Creativity},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICS CULTURE AND SOCIETY},

Month = {2024 SEP 9},
Abstract = {The ongoing creative upscaling of AI at the behest of OpenAI and the
   advent of ChatGPT are both remarkable and alarming. As things stand,
   this lesser-understood and unregulated field is riddled with futuristic
   speculations. And the techno-scientific nuances of AI cannot be imagined
   to function in silos, away from their sociopolitical implications. This
   article undertakes an overall critique of the philosophical
   underpinnings of AI-its sociopolitical and creative aspects.
   Methodologically, the article primarily locates the empire of AI
   phenomenon conceptually and consequently undertakes a
   theoretically-bound qualitative analysis of four key personal interviews
   of people engaged in the creative fields of art, writing, graphic
   design, and learning and development in India. The article
   conceptualizes an `empire of AI' which substitutes a geo-centric notion
   of empire with a globalized, technologically armored, and all-pervasive
   empire. An `empire of AI' encompasses the entire spectrum of lived
   reality and even influences social relations to create the world it
   inhabits. An `empire of AI' unravels the politics of AI which gets more
   complex at an intersection of sociopolitical (related to the
   macro-effect of AI at a global scale) and creativity (linked to the
   micro-effect on individuals as the unit of analysis). This `empire of
   AI' is a byproduct of a theoretical amalgamation of the AI Empire and
   neoliberal governmentality. The former discusses the deterritorialized
   structures of global oppression-digital colonialism, tech hegemony, and
   surveillance at the behest of the AI Empire. The latter focuses on how
   neoliberalism expands its invisible tentacles of governmental control
   through bio-power which seemingly engages in the production of subjects
   as ``free{''} individuals and consumers of the market rationale.},

Abstract = {This paper studies a model of ``pivotal protesting,{''} in which
   citizens act in order to change the outcome rather than to collect
   private benefits. We show that, when citizens face repeated
   opportunities to protest against a regime, pivotal protesting entails
   complex dynamic considerations: The continuation value of the status quo
   influences the citizens' willingness to protest today. Thus, a mere
   change in expectations about the future may trigger a revolt. The same
   logic often induces a pattern of protest cycles, driven by a novel
   source of inefficiency: An expectation that a protest will take place
   tomorrow can excessively sap incentives to coordinate on protesting
   today. Thus, potential protests crowd each other out. This can lead to a
   form of collective procrastination: Access to more opportunities to
   protest can lower the citizens' welfare, as collective action becomes
   inefficiently delayed.},

Title = {Can Turkiye Ensure a Small-Scale Pax Turka through Its Defense
   Industry and Military Power?},
Journal = {INSIGHT TURKEY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Turkiye's relentless efforts to produce indigenous weapons have
   eventually turned into a success story. While the production of
   mid-range and mid-size advanced weapons is already concluded, the race
   for the most advanced and largest weapons is still underway. This study
   argues that Turkiye has partly ensured a Pax Turka in some conflicts,
   and the more sophisticated weapons the Turkish defense industry
   produces, the more the Pax Turka might be prevalent, at least in some
   parts of the region. A small-scale Pax Turka is likely because, first,
   the decisive factor for peace is military strength and industry, which
   Turkiye considerably has and is continuing to have. Second, Turkiye is
   eligible to lead friendly countries, and the latter may accept the
   former's leadership due to various advantages as well as necessities.
   Third, Turkiye and regional countries, which are also buyers of Turkish
   weapons, have similar characteristics and are dependent on each other,
   compelling them to uphold peace with the help of Turkiye. The study also
   asserts that the scope of Pax Turka may expand in the 2030s.},

Abstract = {While Russia may have been less perturbed by certain other NATO
   expansions, and accordingly may have expressed less concern about them,
   it has continuously and emphatically communicated that NATO expansion to
   the Baltics, Ukraine, and/or Georgia would gravely impinge upon Russia's
   interests, and thus that Moscow was/is strongly opposed to such
   expansion. These communications began in the early 1990s, but the US
   dismissed and rejected this opposition- in some cases, quite consciously
   and deliberately. Drawing on official US and Russian sources, this
   article demonstrates that Russia's public stance on NATO's
   Baltic/Ukrainian/Georgian expansion was/is clear- it simply was not
   accommodated.},

Abstract = {The role of Chinese entrepreneurship in the development of
   Russian-Chinese border relations in the context of global regionalism is
   a topic of increasing importance in international studies. Chinese
   entrepreneurship is considered in the context of interregional
   Russian-Chinese cooperation. This paper studies the features of Chinese
   ethnic entrepreneurship in the Russian Far East and examines the impact
   of Chinese businesses on the economic, social, and political dynamics of
   the Russian-Chinese border region and their influence on global
   regionalism. Through case studies and analysis of current trends, this
   paper explores how Chinese entrepreneurship has transformed the border
   region, creating new opportunities for economic cooperation, cultural
   exchange, and political engagement between Russia and China. The author
   also discusses the challenges and potential conflicts that arise from
   the growing presence of Chinese businesses in the region, and offers
   recommendations for fostering positive and sustainable development in
   the area.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {This article rethinks the concept of presence in feminist theory through
   the empirical study of Tunisian feminist and queer movements after the
   2010-11 revolution. Over the past decade, these movements have displayed
   various forms of mobilisation, revealing different shades of
   presence/absence. Some strategies focused on gaining visibility within
   institutions and physical public spaces, while others showed new forms
   of disembodied, digitally mediated presence/absence. With the recent
   rise of cyber-authoritarianism, a re-calibration of positions of
   presence/absence have enriched our understanding of presence. Building
   on interviews and social media content analysis from 2017 to 2023, the
   article challenges the widespread notion that physical presence equates
   to empowerment and absence to disempowerment. It argues that presence
   and absence are political positions within a spectrum of contention,
   influenced by political opportunities, and calls for the recognition of
   multiple, disembodied and hybrid forms of presence/absence.},

Abstract = {Is public policy responsive to demographically and ideologically
   unrepresentative comments given at public meetings? I investigate this
   possibility using a novel data set of over 40,000 comments made at the
   San Francisco Planning Commission between 1998 and 2021, matched to
   information about proposed developments discussed in hearings and
   administrative data on commenters. I document four stylized facts:
   First, commenters at public meetings are unrepresentative of the public
   along racial, gender, age, and homeownership lines; second, distance to
   the proposed development predicts commenting behavior, but only among
   those in opposition; third, commission votes are correlated with
   commenters' preferences; finally, the alignment of White commenters (vs.
   other racial groups) and neighborhood group representatives and the
   general public (vs. other interest groups) better predict project
   approvals.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICS CULTURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 30},
Abstract = {Adapting a Burkean approach to rhetorical tropes, this essay argues that
   polysyndeton comprises a significant trope shaping political
   communication via social media. We argue that polysyndeton reflects the
   cultural dynamics of liquid modernity and furnishes an organizational
   logic to a particular domain of human symbolic action, namely, social
   media. Because polysyndeton dually stresses amplification and
   association, grouping things that do not have a necessary relationship
   and delivering them to an audience as an undifferentiated mass, it is
   perfectly suited to serve as a lens for interpreting the political and
   cultural complexities of our present era, including the Capitol Riot of
   January 6, 2021.},

Abstract = {Little is known about voters' demands in response to rising house
   prices. We argue that voters' house-price perceptions and housing policy
   preferences depend on countries' differing economic institutions. In the
   UK's liberal welfare and credit regimes, we expect voters to view
   house-price growth as a comparatively positive sign for the economy and
   show little demand for policies restraining prices. In Germany's
   generous welfare and restrictive credit regimes, we expect voters to
   view house-price appreciation with more skepticism and demand policies
   restraining prices. First, through a custom survey, we experimentally
   demonstrate that British homeowners regard house-price growth as a sign
   of economic health, while German homeowners and renters from both
   countries do not. Second, we find that German voters, both homeowners
   and renters, support policies restraining house prices more so than
   their British equivalents. Our findings suggest that similar types of
   voters have different housing attitudes in differing institutional
   contexts.},

Abstract = {This project uses the lenses of co-learning and a pedagogy of
   vulnerability to assess the effectiveness of `the Journal Club Module,'
   a tactic to increase critical thinking, build classroom culture, improve
   student research skill development, and model lifelong learning in
   undergraduate classes. In the Journal Club Module, instructors assign
   recent articles that they have not yet read, and then the students and
   instructors read the articles for the first time together in preparation
   for each class. Leveraging survey data and written self-reflections of
   undergraduate students in an upper-division Judicial Politics course,
   this project finds that the Journal Club Module is associated with
   improvements in critical engagement with assigned readings, the
   authenticity of classroom culture, and comfort with academic research.},

Abstract = {Brazil is a major greenhouse gas emitter and is highly vulnerable to
   climate change. Amazonian deforestation control 2005-2012 and a
   comprehensive national climate change adaptation plan in 2016 created
   opportunities for consistent climate action. Yet, subsequent
   administrations reversed this progress, turning the country into a
   laggard. President Lula is reviving the national climate agenda. In this
   article, we use the traditional framework of interests, institutions,
   and ideas to examine Brazilian climate politics and policies of the past
   decade, focusing on the country's major emitting sectors and adaptation
   plans. We identify the factors that hindered the achievement of Brazil's
   climate goals from the early 2010s to 2022 and investigate Lula's new
   mandate. Brazil currently shows renewed proclimate momentum, especially
   in Amazon deforestation control, but hurdles persist, including
   resistance from Congress, fossil fuel focus, financial frailties, and an
   uncertain foreign policy.},

Abstract = {Political polarization has become an increasingly salient issue
   worldwide, but a systematic examination of the variation and sources of
   mass polarization across countries is limited by current measurement
   methods. This work proposes a nonparametric, entropy-based measure of
   mass political polarization. It exploits the specific structure of
   ordinal distributions in public opinion data, makes no prior assumptions
   about the form and spacing of the data, and can still draw reliable
   measures of issue-based polarization. We demonstrate the theoretical and
   practical superiority of the measure with analytical comparisons and
   simulations. We then apply the proposed measure to questions about mass
   polarization in the USA, the relationship between radical parties and
   polarization in Europe, and cross-country trends in affective and
   ideological polarization.},

Abstract = {Prejudice against immigrants has been widely studied in the literature,
   but analyzing immigrant-receiving countries is not the same as analyzing
   sending countries, where the number of immigrants is very low. To
   address this gap, we examine the case of Brazil, a country that has
   witnessed numerous anecdotal episodes of prejudice against immigrants
   despite having a very low flow of migrants and therefore minimal
   material effects on the local population. Our study focuses on the
   levels of discrimination against immigrants in Brazil, with a specific
   analysis of four groups-Haitians, Germans, Venezuelans, and internal
   migrants known as nordestinos. We consider three policy-related
   scenarios-housing, health care, and job training. To mitigate social
   desirability bias, we employ a combination of list and endorsement
   survey experiments in a face-to-face national sample of 1850 respondents
   conducted in January 2019. The results reveal a widespread negative
   perception of all groups of foreigners across all scenarios except the
   local group of migrants. The findings suggest that the Brazilian
   public's discrimination against foreigners is linked to a pervasive
   misperception of the social and economic threat immigrants allegedly
   pose to the nation.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on connections between Indigenous Peoples and water
   to better understand the cultural destruction wrought by residential
   schools. We begin with an overview of how genocide studies address
   connections between childhood socialization and the natural world, and
   how human links to nature are impacted by genocide. This point is
   further illustrated through a discussion of the centrality of water
   within Anishinaabe culture, whereby relationships with water contribute
   to the process of becoming Anishinaabe. We note that childhood is an
   important time for the development of water relations. Residential
   schools interrupted these relationships by transforming water into a
   tool of violence, compelling Indigenous children to reimagine their
   connection to water through the lens of settler capitalism and
   Judeo-Christian morality. Drawing on Survivor testimonies of their
   childhood and relationships with water before, during, and after
   residential schools, we demonstrate how their ability to co-create
   themselves as Anishinaabe with water was stifled in residential schools.
   We also note Survivor testimonies where water is engaged to resist
   assimilation and heal trauma, evidencing how the natural world can play
   an ambivalent role in projects of cultural destruction.},

Abstract = {The public debate portrays the middle class as the big losers in recent
   decades, while people above and below seemingly fared better in terms of
   employment and income growth. This narrative is both conceptually and
   empirically flawed. Based on the Luxembourg Income Study 1980-2020, we
   show for France, Germany, Poland, Spain, the UK, and the US that
   middle-class employment expanded, while the working class shrank. The
   middle class also experienced consistently larger income gains than the
   working class over the past four decades. The disposable real incomes of
   working-class households in France, Germany or the US grew by less than
   half a percent per year, compared to 1\% or more for the middle class.
   Cohort analysis also shows that the promise of doing better than one's
   parents held for the middle class, but vanished for the working class.},

Title = {Can Party Elites Shape the Rank and File? Evidence from a Recruitment
   Campaign in India},

Abstract = {Recruiting a large number of ground workers is crucial for running
   effective modern election campaigns. It is unclear if party leaders can
   influence the quality and quantity of the unpaid rank-and-file workforce
   as they can with prized nominations for candidates. We analyze a field
   experiment conducted by an Indian party that randomized recruitment
   messages reaching 1\% of a 13-million-person electorate to join its rank
   and file. Contrary to concerns that parties can only attract a few
   poor-quality volunteers, we show that elite efforts can shape the rank
   and file. In fact, specific strategies can increase the size, enhance
   the gender and ethnic diversity, and broaden the education and political
   skills of recruits. Strategies that signal gender inclusiveness have a
   lasting impact on some dimensions up to 3 years later. Taken together,
   this article provides the first causal evidence that rank-and-file
   recruitment is an opportunity for elites to influence long-term party
   development.},

Abstract = {Parties strive to set the `terms of the debate' in elections by
   selectively emphasising issue areas that enhance their popular appeal.
   Yet, do citizens respond to parties' issue emphasis, or do they mainly
   respond to objective factors such as economic and environmental
   conditions, crime rates, immigration flows, and so on? We report a
   time-series, cross-sectional analyses of the relationship between the
   public's issue attention, parties' issue emphases and objective national
   conditions across seven issue areas in 13 western publics between 1971
   and 2021, finding a strong association between objective conditions and
   citizens' subsequent issue attention, but weaker associations to party
   system issue attention. There are stronger links, however, between
   parties' issue emphases and their supporters' subsequent attention.},

Abstract = {This article presents an analysis of the role played by ideology and
   habit in ensuring the stability of the socioeconomic order by looking at
   key passages from Gramsci's Prison Notebooks dealing with the notion of
   hegemony and its various aspects. This discussion is informed by
   Beasley-Murray's criticisms against the notion of hegemony and his
   insistence that, at times of crisis, ruling classes' ideologies stop
   mattering, and we should, instead, focus on domination and habit
   imposition. This piece attempts to clarify key concepts such as
   domination, leadership and ideology, as well as presenting distinctions
   between different `forms of consent'. In response to Bealey-Murray's
   critique, it will also highlight how economic and political crises
   effect workers' habitual life, domination and habit imposition within
   production/surplus extraction, leadership style and the subsequent
   `form' bourgeois ideologies must take to appeal to an electorate that
   has lost trust in political elites. It will then conclude with the
   opposite assertion: At time of crises, we should pay even closer
   attention to the `morbid symptoms' displayed by bourgeois ideological
   trends.},

   policy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL POLITICS},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Sometimes, countries target immigration policies to citizens of
   authoritarian regimes with the goal of influencing these regimes'
   politics. Which kinds of immigration rules are optimal
   anti-authoritarian policies and which trade-offs do policy-makers face?
   We analyze a game-theoretic model in which a destination country, an
   autocrat, and a citizen interact. The citizen can engage in protest and
   emigrate while the autocrat can redistribute and repress to counter
   these threats. A revolution occurs if the autocrat does not repress and
   the citizen protests. Policy-makers in destination countries anticipate
   that in equilibrium, a more permissive immigration policy reduces
   repression but also reduces protesting. Therefore, the optimal policy
   strikes a balance between these two effects. A concern for improving the
   citizen's welfare renders policy more permissible while the desire to
   punish the autocrat has an ambiguous effect. Finally, we show that a
   revolution and large-scale emigration are difficult to achieve at the

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that in congressional campaigns, incumbents
   behave very differently than their challengers, especially on social
   media. The research that currently exists regarding how candidates use
   social media during their elections, however, is limited by examining
   only general election tweets. In this manuscript, we update this work by
   examining the Twitter behavior of candidates throughout both their
   primary and general election. By examining the Twitter accounts of
   candidates in the congressional elections in the state of Virginia in
   2022, we show that incumbents and challengers address different issues
   and use a different tone throughout the various stages of their
   campaigns. We also show that gender and partisanship have different
   impacts on the Twitter behavior of candidates in their primaries and
   general elections.},

Abstract = {Besides a legal framework, the political processes of modern polities
   are affected by other rules, commonly referred to as constitutional
   conventions. However, constitutional conventions in Central European
   states have not received particular attention despite growing evidence
   of their existence. This research note aims to help fill in this gap. We
   have conducted semi-structured interviews with 46 country experts and
   delivered comprehensive information about intra-field, inter-field, and
   cross-national variations. Interviews show that among the experts, both
   theoretical and empirical knowledge of constitutional conventions vary
   significantly and that conventions are still largely marginalised,
   notably in political science research.},

Abstract = {Why, despite increased female support, do social democratic parties
   (SDPs) in most Western European countries face electoral decline? To
   study this puzzle, we harness a well-documented regularity: diminishing
   support for SDPs by manual workers and their increased support for the
   far right. We contend that this trend is intensified in contexts where
   the economic positions of SDPs align with market-oriented policies or
   converge with those of the far right. Additionally, as men are
   disproportionately represented among manual workers, this shift
   contributes to the reversal of the gender gap in support for SDPs.
   Drawing on public opinion data from 18 countries spanning half a
   century, along with labor and party economic position data, our findings
   substantiate this argument.},

Abstract = {Why do party systems remain weak in transitioning countries in ways that
   can hamper the democratization process? We answer this question through
   a case study of Tunisia, which was the only success story of the Arab
   uprisings. Tunisia has experienced a process of autocratization since
   President Saied's presidential coup in 2021. Utilizing a historical
   institutionalist framework, we conducted interviews with 15 leaders from
   the major political parties. We find that, in contrast to conventional
   wisdom, the strong party institutionalization under authoritarian rule
   did not lead to an institutionalized party system after authoritarian
   rule ended. We attribute this dynamic to the inability of
   regime-successor parties to institutionalize, perpetuating democratic
   vulnerabilities inherited from authoritarian rule. We also find that
   too-powerful civil societies can be detrimental to transitions. The
   labour union, UGTT, acted as a de facto veto player and limited the
   ability of cabinets to implement reforms. Furthermore, leftist parties
   could not benefit from the UGTT's base. The 2011 revolution was a
   critical juncture that could have facilitated the establishment of an
   institutionalized party system. However, the political elite's
   institutional choices put additional challenges on parties. The weakness
   of the party system in turn contributed to President Saied's self-coup
   and dismantling of Tunisia's democratic institutions.},

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The Christchurch terror attack in March 2019 was a pivotal incident in
   the recent history of right-wing terrorism. Utilizing eight proximal
   warning behaviors from the Terrorist Radicalization Assessment Protocol
   (TRAP-18), this article provides a qualitative analysis of the
   attacker's behavior following the formation of his terrorist intent.
   Events and activities were coded against the eight warning behaviors and
   assigned a date where known, thereby creating a comprehensive chronology
   of events commencing from January 2017 up to the time of the attack.
   Five insights of theoretical and operational relevance when utilizing
   proximal warning factors emerge from the analysis: timing; the impact of
   security awareness; the interplay between factors; the effect of image
   management; and the social connectedness of lone actors. This study adds
   to the growing body of empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of the
   TRAP-18 as an instrument through which to analyze the behavior and
   mindset of lone actor terrorists. It provides further insights to inform
   the process of person of interest prioritization among counter-terrorism
   investigators and contributes to academic knowledge of threat
   assessment.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {90},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In Buckley v. Valeo (1976), the US Supreme Court ruled that campaign
   finance regulations ``are appropriate legislative weapons against the
   reality or appearance of improper influence.{''} Using data from
   multiple survey experiments repeated across six CCES surveys from 2012
   to 2020, we test whether varied information regarding US campaign
   finance institutions and laws alter public perceptions of the campaign
   finance system and campaign finance reform across time, including the
   perception of improper influence. Respondents had more negative
   attitudes toward candidates who received support from Super PACs.
   However, respondents were not moved by primed differences in expenditure
   limits, coordination, or donation disclosure. Ultimately, we find that
   the majority of Americans dislike and distrust the campaign finance
   system and generally remain unmoved by any experimentally-primed
   differences. These experimental findings remain consistent across time,
   indicating that attitudes toward the US campaign finance system are
   stable and resistant to change.},

Abstract = {Following the collapse of the Islamic State, the issue of ``Returning
   Foreign Fighters{''} became a dominant global problem. The securitised
   response adopted by many states is a cause for concern, particularly in
   relation to human rights. Men, women and children with a range of
   physical and psychological trauma are now situated in camps across
   northeastern Syria, posing a complex security threat. The situation in
   these camps is far from secure, and the risk of radicalisation and
   indoctrination (among the children in particular) is high. Through the
   development of a model of risk analysis which emphasises both security
   risks and human rights risks, this paper presents an innovative
   exploration of the phenomenon of women and children associated with ISIS
   in north-east Syria. The impact of this study is wide-reaching and is
   intended to provide a foundation for resolving the heightened security
   threat these individuals pose in the medium and long terms.},

Abstract = {Can allegations of electoral fraud and misconduct undermine
   participation in democratic politics? If so, how large and long lasting
   are these turnout declines? We investigate these questions in the
   context of the high-profile, unsubstantiated allegations of electoral
   fraud in the 2020 presidential election made by President Trump and his
   allies. We examine the relationship between attitudes toward Trump and
   the decision to turn out in the 2021 Georgia runoff. At the
   precinct-level, we employ five alternative measures of Trump popularity
   to show that precincts where Trump is popular experienced large relative
   declines in turnout in the runoff. We then undertake an individual-level
   analysis by employing statistical learning algorithms to characterize
   the relationship between stated Trump attitudes and respondent
   demographics. Using a variety of research designs that control for
   unobserved heterogeneity in turnout propensity, we find that Trump
   supporters experienced large relative turnout declines, 1.7 percentage
   points in our base specification, in the runoff. Finally, we estimate
   whether these turnout declines persist to the 2022 election. We find
   smaller turnout declines among Trump supporters in the 2022 Georgia
   Senate runoff. Our findings are consistent with the perspective that
   extreme and well-publicized allegations of electoral fraud can
   discourage some citizens from participating in the democratic process,
   but that the effects are modest and short lived.},

   democracy to popular socialism},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 5},
Abstract = {This article builds on the insights of Antonio Gramsci and Stuart Hall
   to introduce the `critical-relational' approach to the analysis of
   left-wing ideologies that have been defined as populist. In doing so, we
   identify four distinctive ideologies: `populist social democracy',
   `populist socialism', `popular social democracy' and `popular
   socialism'. Two key contributions are made. First, the `relational'
   aspect of this conceptualization establishes clear distinctions between
   ideologies that appeal to the `people' either to: (i) democratically
   empower ('popular') or disempower ('populist') disenfranchised groups;
   and/or (ii) disrupt economic class relations ('socialist') or
   redistribute them without transforming them ('social democratic'). These
   distinctions, we contend, shed light on important differences between
   left-wing ideologies that are often conflated in the literature on left
   populism. Second, the `critical' aspect of our interpretation aims to
   reveal how discourses of the `people' are mobilized within left-wing
   ideologies to either reproduce or contest economic and political
   structures of power. Overall, this provides grounding for a more precise
   empirical analysis of the diverse ideologies that characterize the
   political left.},

Abstract = {This study investigates Italian citizens' news diets during the 2019
   European election and examines the relationship between these diets and
   citizens' attitudes to three central political issues: trust in the EU,
   prejudice towards migrants and populist attitudes. Combining a
   self-report survey with passive data recording real news consumption,
   the study identified three main user profiles. It verified that News
   Avoiders (meagre news diets) associate with distrust in the EU,
   anti-immigrant positions and populist attitudes; News Seekers
   (cross-media and in-depth information) align with open-minded attitudes
   towards Europe and immigration; the TV-News Centric (almost
   single-channel news) identify with moderate political attitudes.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {46},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {While Americans celebrate the Constitutional Convention of 1787, they
   are not nearly as enthusiastic about the prospect of another
   constitutional convention through the Article V process. The stakes
   would be high, including the possibility of rewriting the entire
   document. At present, calls for a new convention come much more from
   conservatives than progressives. Afraid of the risks, many progressives
   oppose such a convention, with the notable exception of Sanford
   Levinson, who for decades has railed against its antidemocratic features
   and adverse political effects. What is absent from the recent
   scholarship about a convention is a serious discussion about
   distributive justice. As an alternative to the dominant progressive
   approach underscoring democratic reform, my focus will be on how to
   protect the most vulnerable persons from financial insecurity through
   the constitutionalization of positive economic rights. This article also
   explains why progressive scholars must appreciate the deliberative and
   civic educational potential of a convention. For the time being, another
   convention is highly unlikely to result in meaningful constitutional
   reform. However, this situation could be a blessing in disguise. A new
   convention could spark a national conversation about distributive
   justice and what could be done to reduce economic inequality and
   alleviate poverty.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of secret police organizations on the
   occurrence of antiregime protests in authoritarian regimes. We argue
   that such organizations are related to lower levels of protests via two
   related mechanisms: intelligence gathering and an increased perception
   of risk among citizens, which reduce citizens' ability and willingness
   to mobilize, respectively. Using new data on secret police organizations
   in dictatorships covering the post-World War II period, our findings
   support the main expectation. This research contributes to our
   understanding of security institutions, antiregime protests, and the
   repression-dissent nexus.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the Salvador Allende's final speech, broadcast by
   Radio Magallanes on September 11, 1973. Allende uses the radio, a
   privileged terrain of political struggle in Chile during the beginning
   of the 1970s, to frame his death as a political selfsacrifice in which
   he performs the act of giving his own life. By symbolically transforming
   defeat into hope, his speech holds out the promise of a new future where
   the order that will be established by the coup d'\& eacute;tat will have
   been overthrown, and thus questioning its legitimacy.},

Journal = {REVISTA ESPANOLA DE CIENCIA POLITICA-RECP},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The municipal elections of 2015 and 2019 transformed local party systems
   towards multiparty models and decentralized the power historically held
   by the two major state-based parties. This study presents an
   unprecedented global view of this process of change in the political
   configuration of power in the Spanish city councils of provincial
   capitals and the two autonomous cities. It adopts a broad longitudinal
   perspective, covering six electoral moments over the last two decades,
   analyzing a total of 312 mayoral elections cases. The analysis is based
   on an original database that tracks variations in the number of parties
   with representation, the types of governments on which the constitution
   of the mayoral offices is based, and the resulting positions occupied by
   the different parties. The results indicate that in 2015 and 2019, there
   was an increase in parties sharing power, with a reduction in majority
   governments in favor of coalitions and minority governments. In 2023,
   despite a return to a scenario with fewer parties and an increase in
   majority governments, it cannot be asserted that the party system has
   reverted to its pre-Great Recession state, as major parties such as the
   PP still rely in other political formations to form the governments in
   many provincial capitals.},

Abstract = {In this essay, I investigate the ways in which abolitionists and
   pro-slavery forces use Tocqueville before and during the Civil War,
   drawing on the major black and white abolitionist newspapers (The
   Liberator, National Anti-Slavery Standard, The National Era, The North
   Star, and The Colored American). By focusing on the dissemination of
   Tocqueville's ideas within a specific audience of white abolitionists,
   and on the impact of blacks' criticism on this process, I challenge
   Tocqueville's abolitionist arguments. Thus, using Tocqueville as a prism
   through which to discuss some of the key issues surrounding the
   abolitionist struggles, I show that the author's reception depends on
   the relevance of these struggles and claims for the definition of
   democracy itself as an endless and potentially unmanageable process.},

Abstract = {The paper provides a comparative analysis of the presidential systems of
   Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Uruguay, covering the period between
   1989 and 2022, with the aim of examining the factors that motivate a
   person in the head of a ministry to seek the presidential candidacy. The
   central argument holds that both the incumbent president and the
   political parties have the purpose of taking advantage of a person's
   passage through a Cabinet of State to boost his or her presidential
   candidacy within the political organization. The selected cases are
   justified due to the existence of historical moments in which ministers
   have left their posts to compete for the presidency in these countries.
   The methodology employed in this study follows a multi- method logic.
   First, quantitative logistic regression analysis is used, followed by
   qualitative press analysis of ministers' careers to support the
   theoretical argument. The most notable results highlight that having a
   political profile, being a member of the president's political party and
   having held a political ministry are influential factors when running in
   presidential elections.},

   {[}Anonymous], Globally, the countries with the most nonviolent mass campaigns are Haiti (9), Bolivia and Thailand (8), and Pakistan and South Korea (7). It is the recent increase in nonviolent movements and dispersion of campaigns across different African countries that accounts for the region's significant share of campaigns globally today.
   {[}Anonymous], This is largely due to the number of states in the African region; both Asia and the Middle East have a higher rate of state-based conflicts in their respective regions during the 1990s and 2010s.

Abstract = {Vladimir Putin came to power with a war. He may lose power because of
   the war of aggression against Ukraine. His choice to invade Ukraine in
   2022 marked the culmination of a spiral of diktat and confrontation that
   started in 2012, when the strongman was challenged by his own people and
   would not tolerate democratization at home or in Ukraine. The rise of
   tyranny and the propensity to initiate wars are inextricably linked in
   Putin's Russia.},

Abstract = {This article studies whether countries' speeches at the United Nations
   General Assembly (UNGA) matter for international aid allocation. I use a
   supervised machine learning algorithm called Wordscore and 7,533
   different statements from 198 countries made in the period from 1975 to
   2018 to measure countries' preferences from text. Then, by employing
   panel regression analysis and the synthetic control method, I find
   considerable evidence that countries' preferences derived from speeches
   affect aid allocation. Both the US and Russia provide more aid to
   countries that present speeches more in line with their current agenda
   and preferences.},

Abstract = {This work aims to identify and map the new dynamics emerging at national
   conferences by analyzing the presence and actions of groups and actors
   who identify with the right and extreme right. As a cross-section, we
   followed the national conferences that took place in 2023 and the first
   half of 2024. To do this, we used survey data, participant observation,
   analysis of official documents and social media posts. The results of
   the research indicate the diversity of the political confrontation in
   each area analyzed and delimits important analytical dimensions such as
   the relationship with social networks and the conflict over value
   agendas.},

Title = {Punk music and cinnamon buns. From everyday resistance to contentious
   politics in a 1980s Swedish autonomous center},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 23},
Abstract = {During the 1980s, a number of new protest movements emerged that
   protested against the welfare state and right-wing politics. Influenced
   by punk, anarchism and the libertarian left, activists often met in
   so-called autonomous social centers. In many European countries,
   resistance became contentious, but resistance also took the form of
   everyday practices. The aim of this article is to study political
   resistance in the 1980s Sweden, carried out by the cultural association
   Ultra between 1980 and 1988. Based on theories of everyday resistance,
   contentious politics and prefigurative politics, ideas, and practices in
   Ultrahuset (the Ultra house) are examined. I study how the everyday
   resistance developed toward a more contentious resistance, as the
   relationship with the local authorities changed, and how the concept of
   prefigurative politics contributes to an understanding of the
   relationship between everyday practices and resistance. Source material
   consists of texts and illustrations produced in Ultrahuset, media
   material and interviews with former members. The result show that the
   activism in Ultrahuset can be understood as a way of doing prefigurative
   politics through everyday resistance, but also that during the 1980s,
   when the relation between Ultra and the surrounding society changed, the
   resistance also changed, becoming more outward-looking and contentious.},

Abstract = {In the drafting process of Germany's first National Security Strategy,
   the leading Ausw \& auml;rtiges Amt (Federal Foreign Office) conducted a
   participation series that was unprecedented in terms of both quantity
   and quality. In the summer of 2022, the Ausw \& auml;rtiges Amt offered
   various dialogue and participation formats across the country, in which
   randomly selected citizens could contribute their opinions and develop
   recommendations. However, this innovative opening of the strategy
   process was limited by certain control techniques used by the Ausw \&
   auml;rtiges Amt for better manageability and risk avoidance. In this
   paper, we argue that the participation around the National Security
   Strategy can be understood as a controlled politicisation. The executive
   specifically politicises some aspects, while at the same time other
   aspects are intentionally depoliticised. Nevertheless, it remains
   unclear how controllable a top-down politicisation can be in view of
   unintended effects.},

Abstract = {In the member states of the European Union (EU), there are increasing
   signs of waning EU support, particularly in the form of anti-EU
   sentiment and voting. Yet, the salient role of pro-EU voting has not
   been side-lined entirely. Using a combination of data from EES and CHES
   that estimates the positional distance between voters and parties on the
   EU, the results suggest that voters are significantly mobilised on
   support for the EU. This is congruent to recent evidence that has shown
   that voters have rewarded parties with more polarised stances on the EU
   and, contrary to Eurosceptic party mobilisation, those parties with a
   more extreme pro-EU stance. Here, the more vocal a Europhile party, the
   more likely that citizens will vote for that party given their
   positional closeness to the EU. The findings in this article suggest the
   (re-) emergence of an EU dimension with mobilising effects on parties
   and voters and serious consequences for the dynamics of party
   competition.},

Abstract = {Individuals with heightened labor market insecurity express more
   protectionist, xenophobic, and isolationist sentiment. We construct a
   novel measure of labor market insecurity that combines an individual's
   industry-based exposure to import competition with an occupation-based
   measure of job immobility. Immobility captures the similarity of an
   individual's job to others in the economy, weighted by their prevalence.
   The holder of a job that is dissimilar to others in the industry or in
   the state experiences more anxiety regarding their labor market
   prospects in the face of a globalization shock, and is more likely to
   express antiglobalization sentiment.},

Abstract = {The past decade has witnessed growing challenges to democracies around
   the world, with rising levels of democratic discontent and political
   violence. While a growing body of work has begun examining the
   determinants of satisfaction with democracy in European and American
   contexts, less is known about the African context. South Africa serves
   as a particularly fruitful case to study, as it shares many
   western-style institutions and elections, but has come to be known as a
   ``violent democracy,{''} where citizens regularly engage in political
   violence to extract concessions and enforce government accountability.
   This study examines how exposure to protests and riots affects citizen
   satisfaction with democracy. Using geolocated data from four successive
   rounds of the Afrobarometer data as well as data from the Armed Conflict
   Location Event Data. I find that exposure to local violent riots
   correlates with reduced reports of satisfaction with democracy. I find
   that these results are robust, even when integrating measures of control
   against endogeneity into the models.},

Abstract = {Social media has received tremendous attention as a tool of revolution
   since the Arab Spring. Current scholarship predicts that social media
   can be a threat to internal stability by aiding rebel recruitment and
   mobilizing them. This article expands this research agenda beyond the
   Middle East-North Africa region and authoritarian regimes and explains
   the dynamics of how social media affects contentious politics. Youth
   bulge is used here as an intervening variable between social media and
   conflict. Using mixed methods on a sample of 28 Indian states, four
   Union Territories and 200 educated youth, I find that the presence of
   educated youth using social media is not a clear threat. Online and
   offline surveys conducted on Indian youth show that they do not consider
   social media a useful ``technology of revolution{''} for mobilizing
   support and thereby bringing about any meaningful change. At best,
   social media helps in gathering support at the local level like in a
   neighborhood brawl.},

Journal = {SWISS POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {154-168},

Abstract = {Political science research into the determinants and consequences of who
   was taught what, when, and how in public schools is rare. One challenge
   encountered by researchers is that structured and detailed (historical)
   comparative data about curricula is limited, also in Switzerland. We
   contribute to closing this gap by introducing HESSS, a novel dataset on
   the provision of home economics education
   ({''}Hauswirtschaftsunterricht{''}) in Switzerland in ten
   German-speaking cantons for vocational- and university-track secondary
   schools since 1980 and 1991, respectively. Our dataset can help scholars
   explore variation in home economics education over time and across
   cantons, and facilitate research on the Swiss educational system. In
   this research note, we outline the main features of the data and
   illustrate how they can be used in two applications: (i) tracking the
   switch from gender-segregated to co-educated home economics classes
   across cantons; and (ii) describing the impact of budget cuts on home
   economics in the canton of Zurich.},

Abstract = {Disinformation has transformed into a global issue and while it is seen
   as a growing concern to democracy today, autocrats have long used it as
   a part of their propaganda repertoire. Yet, no study has tested the
   effect of disinformation on regime stability and breakdown beyond
   country-specific studies. Drawing on novel measures from the Digital
   Society Project (DSP) estimating the levels of disinformation
   disseminated by governments across 148 countries between 2000-2022 and
   from the Episodes of Regime Transformation (ERT) dataset, we provide the
   first global comparative study of disinformation and survival of
   democratic and authoritarian regimes, respectively. The results show
   that in authoritarian regimes, disinformation helps rulers to stay in
   power as regimes with higher levels of disinformation are less likely to
   experience democratization episodes. In democracies, on the other hand,
   disinformation increases the probability of autocratization onsets. As
   such, this study is the first to provide comparative evidence on the
   negative effects of disinformation on democracy as well as on the
   prospects of democratization.},

Abstract = {Democratic backsliding has posed significant challenges to democracies
   in many countries. Recent calls for a better theorization of pushback
   against backsliding have triggered renewed scholarly interest in the
   field of opposition and its role in stopping or reversing creeping
   authoritarian rule. This study calls for a theoretical and empirical
   recalibration of the concept of opposition to account for multifaceted
   `non-partisan' actors and venues of oppositional mobilization. It
   proposes a new classification of resilient civic opposition. The
   explanatory typology is based on two factors: (1) the ability of civic
   opposition to bring multiple grievances together and to balance between
   on-street and off-street mediums, and (2) the rapport between political
   opposition parties and civic opposition. Four cases of civic opposition
   from Hungary and Turkey illustrate the proposed typology empirically.},

Abstract = {Seminal models in political economy imply that rising economic
   inequality should lead to growing public demand for redistribution. Yet,
   existing empirical evidence on this link is both limited and
   inconclusive - and scholars regularly doubt it exists at all. In this
   research note, we turn to data from the International Social Survey
   Programme's (ISSP) Social Inequality surveys, now spanning the period
   from 1987 to 2019, to reassess the effect of rising inequality on
   support for redistribution. Covering a longer time series than previous
   studies, we obtain robust evidence that when income inequality rises in
   a country, public support for income redistribution tends to go up.
   Examining the reaction across income groups to adjudicate between
   different models of how rising inequality matters in a second step, we
   find that rising inequality increases support for redistribution within
   all income groups, with a marginally stronger effect among the well-off.
   Our results imply that insufficient policy responses to rising
   inequality may be less about absent demand and more about a failure to
   turn demand into policy, and that scholars should devote more attention
   to the latter.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom says vote buying undermines trust in elections, but
   few have examined this systematically. We identify why this relationship
   ought to hold, on average. We also derive two conditioning hypotheses:
   vote buying will be less consequential among citizens who view these
   exchanges as positive and in contexts marred by electoral
   irregularities. We test these three expectations with analyses of
   cross-national survey data and an original survey experiment. We find
   only a small and inconsistent relationship between vote buying and
   electoral trust. We find weak evidence on the role of norms and more
   support for the notion that context matters. We conclude that a modest
   connection between vote buying and electoral trust is driven less by
   approval of vote buying practices and more by variation in how elections
   are actually conducted and, related, the relative novelty of being
   exposed to vote buying.},

Abstract = {Metaphors of positions, spectrums, perspectives, viewpoints, and
   polarization reflect the same model, which treats beliefs-and the people
   who hold them-as points in space. This model is deeply rooted in
   quantitative research methods and influential traditions of Continental
   philosophy, and it is evident in some qualitative research. It can
   suggest that deliberation is difficult and rare because many people are
   located far apart ideologically, and their respective positions can be
   explained as dependent variables of factors like personality,
   partisanship, and demographics. An alternative model treats a given
   person's beliefs as connected by reasons to form networks. People
   disclose the connections among their respective beliefs when they
   discuss issues. This model offers insights about specific cases, such as
   discussions conducted on two US college campuses, which are represented
   here as belief-networks. The model also supports a more optimistic view
   of the public's capacity to deliberate.},

Abstract = {In the months leading up to the 2022 midterms, Republicans believed a
   variety of factors were working in their favor including inflation and
   overall state of the economy, redistricting, and Biden's low levels of
   public approval. After the electoral dust settled, Republicans won a
   narrow majority in the House, but actually lost a seat in the Senate.
   Why did Republicans fail to fully capitalize on the specific midterm
   conditions that historically have favored the out-party? This paper
   examines the results of the 2022 primary and general elections,
   identifies electoral trends and themes, and considers the implications
   of the results in terms of prior congressional election research. Based
   on aggregate election data and survey-based evidence, it appears that
   former President Trump's enduring shadow over the midterms and the
   Supreme Court's decision in the Dobbs case hindered the Republicans'
   ability to win a larger share of seats in Congress.},

Abstract = {In October 2019, Chile experienced its most significant cycle of
   protests since the return to democracy in 1990; one of the primary
   demands of this cycle was the improvement of pensions. What effect did
   the October upheaval have on the Chilean pension policy debate? How have
   ideas about the Chilean pension plan changed from its creation in
   1981-2019? What are the main drivers of these changes? In this study, we
   propose the concept of policy space, which we define as the realm of
   ideas wherein public policies are debated and whose boundaries are
   determined by the legitimacy of ideas from relevant actors. We use a
   process-tracing approach based on qualitative data triangulation from
   several techniques including in-depth interviews, press analysis, and
   secondary document review. The findings indicate that the shift in the
   ideas related to pension policy is explained by two drivers-long-term
   linkage among actors and short-term social mobilization against the
   private pension system, which accelerated rapidly with the October 2019
   protests.},

Abstract = {Early voting laws intended to increase voter turnout seem to have had
   little to no effect on turnout. Why? We argue that the effects of early
   voting on turnout are contingent on campaigns providing citizens with
   information about the election, their choices, and how to vote early.
   When campaigns do so, turnout increases because citizens are more likely
   to vote - and more likely to vote early. Using individual-level panel
   data, we show that direct campaign contact increases turnout exclusively
   via the use of early voting. Using county-level data, we show that
   campaign ad volume also increases turnout via an increase in early
   voting turnout. Our results affirm our expectation that campaigns
   facilitate the expected mobilizing effects of early voting. At the same
   time, the effects of campaigns on early voting are small in magnitude,
   and emerge only under campaign mobilization conditions that are more the
   exception than the norm.},

Abstract = {Public support for redistributive policies (e.g., Medicaid) depends in
   part on the perceived need and deservingness of beneficiaries. However,
   the average citizen is not well informed about the economic conditions
   of their fellow citizens. In this article, we explore how information
   about average earnings of the working poor (a group generally seen as
   deserving) influences support for redistributive spending. Two survey
   experiments test whether support for such spending is affected by
   information about the average incomes of low-wage occupations (e.g.,
   home health aides and retail sales workers). We additionally explore
   potential mechanisms for this effect, including empathy. An exploratory
   study finds an effect, but a pre-registered confirmatory study yields
   substantively small findings with inconsistent significance. Even when
   participants both receive detailed information about low-wage
   occupations' salaries and are encouraged to recall people who they know
   in those jobs, the treatment has no substantial effect. Given the
   strength of this treatment and the lack of consistent effects, we
   conclude that interventions providing information about low-income
   salaries (e.g., in news coverage or interpersonal conversation) are
   unlikely to have a substantive effect on support for redistribution.},

Abstract = {Systemic congruence between the whole legislature and the whole
   electorate ('many-to-many', or sociotropic congruence) should be the
   benchmark to evaluate a democratic system. Yet, most studies link shifts
   in democratic preferences to individual-level representation
   ('many-to-one', or egocentric incongruence), since individual-level
   representation failures should be more salient and visible for
   individual citizens. We argue that the sociotropic incongruence
   hypothesis has not been appropriately tested to date, because the
   measure does not vary at individual level in observational data. Using
   an experiment conducted in France, we manipulate various sociotropic
   (in)congruence scenarios at the individual level. In addition to the
   incongruence hypotheses, our original experiment tests whether offering
   expertise-based justifications to incongruence attenuates the backlash
   against representatives. We find that, even when giving sociotropic
   incongruence a fair test, egocentric incongruence still consistently
   shapes democratic preferences, while the effect of sociotropic
   incongruence remains negligible. Furthermore, we find that narratives
   rooted in expertise claims do not attenuate the effect of representation
   failure on backlash against representative democracy: they exacerbate
   it.},

Abstract = {This essay argues for two conclusions. First, clinical decision-making
   is not best thought of as analogous to the purchase of other services,
   such as car repair. Health-care decision-making is far more difficult,
   collaborative, emotionally fraught, and subject to cognitive
   distortions. Second, the provision of health care should not be
   delegated to unregulated markets. Unlike other markets, there is no
   reason to expect health-care market outcomes to be efficient or fair or
   to promote individual freedom, properly conceived. Markets may play an
   important role in implementing an allocation of healthcare, but they are
   not an ethically acceptable alternative to determining what that
   allocation should be.},

Abstract = {A woman has not yet shattered the ``hardest, highest glass ceiling{''}
   of the American presidency. Our research answers two questions: Which
   groups are more likely to believe electing a woman president to be
   historically important? (R1), and When a presidential election is at
   stake, who is likely to support a woman candidate? (R2). Using
   observational data (n = 1075), our findings indicate that women, people
   who recognize sexism within politics, Democrats, and liberals are more
   likely to view a woman president as historic. Utilizing a list
   experiment of hypothetical 2024 presidential matchups, few who claimed
   to view a woman president as historic were willing to cast a vote in
   their favor. When push came to shove, Democratic women were the group
   most likely to vote for a woman presidential candidate. As parties look
   toward the future, this study offers insight into how voters respond to
   potential nominees and who parties will nominate.},

Abstract = {Recurrent violent clashes between pastoral herders and farming
   communities in Nigeria have resulted in human fatalities, livelihood
   losses and displacements. However, studies have yet to interrogate how
   displaced farming communities construct justice as a way to restore
   peace. Using Internal Displaced Persons (IDPs) camp in Abegana, Makurdi
   Local Government Area (LGA) of Benue State, 25 participants responded to
   questions on their experiences and how they see justice from their
   victimhood as a way to peace restoration. I also balanced this with how
   herders construct justice. Findings show that justice is constructed as
   returning to their ancestral homeland where they were displaced by
   conflict; compensation to rebuild burnt houses and restart businesses
   and implementation of open grazing by government to check recurrence.
   Herders see anti-open grazing laws as injustice, exclusionary and
   persecutory rather than see them as victims with human and material
   losses that need to be protected. This study recommends injecting
   victims' perspectives into peace building interventions in conflict
   zones.},

Abstract = {In this article we seek to contribute to the analysis of the phenomenon
   of Javier Milei as an emerging leader in Argentina. Our hypothesis
   states that this phenomenon responds to the encounter between
   anti-politics as a latent citizen sentiment and a strategic political
   discourse. The research combines two techniques, a survey and multimodal
   content analysis of Milei's official TikTok account and satellite
   accounts created to give greater visibility to his figure. We observed
   that a large part of the citizenry has a negative view of
   ``politicians'' and that Milei's discourse builds a myth based on his
   fiery rejection of ``the caste{''}},

Number = {2},
Month = {MAY-AUG},
Abstract = {Dialectical refutation, used by Plato and Aristotle to justify first
   principles, is taken up by Descartes and Kant to determine the nature of
   the transcendental. Hegel collects the legacy of this dialectical
   tradition and transforms it in the fundamental character of his
   conception of the absolute. His philosophy takes on the dual aspect of
   positive exposition and critical refutation. The critical theory of
   Horkheimer and Adorno proposes the procedure of determined negation both
   as a tool of social criticism and as a royal road to gain access to the
   truth. Habermas's work is characterized by his explicit recovery of the
   refutation procedure, which is followed by a renewed and transformed
   conception of the transcendental. This allows a rethinking of dialectics
   within the coordinates of dialogics.},

Abstract = {In its beginnings, the Internet sought to legitimise itself with an
   utopian discourse based on the potential of digital communications for
   the progress of humanity. It was to serve as a roadmap for the great
   emancipatory project of our time. But academic research unmasked its
   argumentation: it was seen as a resource with which to hide business
   interests that harm users. Instead, the study of the emoji has been left
   outside of any suspicion. This disdain for the risks of emoji can be
   explained because emoji have been seen as a metaphor rather than an
   idiom, which users automatically use to frame digital communications
   within conventional parameters (intimacy, friendship, empathy, etc.).
   With this involuntary complicity of users, the very na \& iuml;f tone of
   the legitimizing discourse of digital technology has been reactivated.
   This has made conversations in electronic media decidedly light,
   childish, with the features of emoji. With a primary objective: to win
   the will of the interlocutor. But with more serious consequences in the
   reduction of our patterns of perception, as these modes of communication
   transfer a more standard understanding of reality.},

Abstract = {At the beginning of the 1990s, Norberto Bobbio trusted that in the 21st
   century the << Age of Rights >> would take place, that the model of
   constitutional democracy would be the political form of almost all of
   mankind. Thirty years later, we find ourselves witnessing the aggressive
   presence of those political regimes that Western political thought has
   defined, beginning with Aristotle, as forms of << Oriental despotism >>.
   This essay tries to critically reconstruct the heuristic capacity of
   this << recurring theme >>, with particular reference to the case of

   Policing: interventions for instigating cultural change},
Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},

Volume = {95},

Abstract = {Changing ingrained behaviours linked to sexism and misogyny in policing
   cannot be achieved by a quick fix. There are numerous barriers to change
   within the policing system, which require multiple targeted
   interventions running in parallel to tackle sexism and misogyny
   successfully. A behavioural science approach was applied to `diagnose'
   the problem and identify interventions systematically. This approach
   does not seek to explain behaviour in terms of the characteristics of
   individual officers or staff. It combines insights from a range of
   disciplines to understand how people act in particular contexts. There
   is no single intervention that can shift ingrained behaviour; a package
   of targeted interventions is needed. Using the `behaviour change wheel'
   as the underpinning framework, four target behaviours, seven key
   influences on behaviour and twelve interventions for change were
   identified. The connections between the behaviours, influences and
   interventions illustrate how a holistic package of interventions is
   required to change culture across the policing system.},

Abstract = {Although a large literature investigates cross-national differences in
   party mobilization, little is known about cross-national gender
   differences in electoral campaign contacts. Using the Comparative Study
   of Electoral System Module 4, which includes data from 2011 to 2016 and
   32 countries, I find gendered patterns in reported contacts across
   different activities performed by campaigns. I test two potential
   explanation for these variations: electoral systems and women's
   political participation. First, I find that women's likelihood of
   reported contacts increases to a greater extent than men's when
   electoral systems provide incentives for campaigns to increase their
   contact rates, decreasing and even reversing gender gaps. Second, I find
   limited support regarding the impact of the percentage of women in
   legislatures on gender differences in reported electoral campaign
   contacts.},

Abstract = {This article examines the contradictions of the capitalist system,
   particularly its exploitation of labor, humans, and nature, as the root
   cause of the global polycrisis. It argues that energy transition
   projects, when not anchored in an internationalist and just ecological
   transition paradigm, can lead to material conflicts between domestic
   interests and those on the periphery of the system. The article
   emphasizes the need for a planet-wide just transition, necessitating an
   internationalist critique of extractivism and debates connected to
   post-extractivism. Just transition programs will look different
   everywhere, but ultimately depend on one another to ensure that they are
   actually just. By examining the conflicts posed by extractivism in a
   green transition projects, from energy to transportation, this paper
   argues for expanding just transition debates in an internationalist
   manner so that the political practice of transition in one place does
   not come at the cost of creating sacrifice zones somewhere else.},

Abstract = {Populist radical right (PRR) parties are often more successful in some
   regions of their countries than in others. However, previous research
   shows that the relationship between context and PRR support is not
   straightforward. We develop and test an expanded framework linking local
   conditions to PRR support through two causal mechanisms. First, we argue
   economic and cultural contextual factors can influence citizens by
   fostering a sense of perceived local decline, which in turn predicts
   both populist and nativist attitudes and, hence, PRR support
   (mediation). Second, we expect that citizens with fewer resources and
   stronger local embeddedness are more strongly influenced by the context
   in which they live (moderation). Combining geocoded survey data with
   contextual data from four countries (DE, FR, GB and NL), we show that
   the link between local context and PRR support is indeed mediated and
   moderated, providing a better understanding of the spatial distribution
   behind recent PRR success.},

Abstract = {Do people vote to meet others' approval or to avoid their disapproval if
   they were to abstain? We examine the role of injunctive norms on turnout
   by means of discussion network data from an original survey module in
   the Austrian National Election Study. We improve on previous measures of
   injunctive norms by asking respondents whether their political
   discussants would disapprove if they abstained. We find that about half
   of the respondents believe that people around them would be disappointed
   if they did not vote and that disapproval expectations matter for
   turnout, but only among those with a weak sense of civic duty. Our study
   contributes to a better understanding of how individual perceptions
   about social norms matter for voter turnout.},

Abstract = {Australia has historically been a prominent diplomatic partner for the
   Pacific Island countries, providing development assistance to support
   their social and economic progress. China gradually heightened its
   political and economic influence in the Pacific area by integrating the
   region into its Belt and Road Initiative. This development has
   encouraged scholars to examine Australia's diplomatic engagements in the
   Pacific region in response to China's growing presence. This article
   approaches this issue by using the concept of economic statecraft as an
   analytical tool. It argues that Australia's reactions to China's
   presence through the infusion of strategic motivations into foreign aid
   and the use of multilateral agreements and initiatives can be seen as
   positive economic statecraft with two characterizations: emulation of
   China's successful strategies and differentiation from Chinese
   approaches through the incorporation of multilateral and ideational
   methods.},

Abstract = {The Conservative Party has usually done well in rural areas, but its
   `green wall' is now under threat from Labour more than the Liberal
   Democrats. Farmers did not support Brexit any more than the general
   population, and in income terms they are currently doing well, but fear
   for the future. In addition, food security issues are more complex than
   they are portrayed, as are the relations with the devolved governments.
   In Scotland, the government there is much more popular among Scottish
   farmers whilst the government in Wales is doing much worse among farming
   communities.},

Abstract = {For decades, oppressive state policies have forced some Kurds to leave
   Turkey and seek refuge in Western countries, including Sweden and
   Canada. We conducted semi-structured interviews with Kurdish youth
   living in Canada and Sweden (N = 15) to explore the role of
   identity-related grievances in their involvement in the Kurdish
   movement, a political movement comprised of an array of actors including
   an armed group, political parties, and civil society organizations. By
   implementing the Building Resilience Against Violent Extremism (BRAVE)
   tool, we investigated their collective resilience against calls for
   violence, extremist views, and challenges caused by repression. Findings
   indicated that the major factors in their involvement were the
   restrictions on their language, culture, and identity; the
   discrimination and injustices against them and their community; the
   traumatic events that they experienced or witnessed; and the involvement
   of their family and community members in the movement. The overall
   resilience scores of the participants were high (M = 58.67 out of a
   potential 14-70), but they scored lower when their relationship with
   Turkish authorities is considered (M = 53.13; SD = 5.65) than with their
   host countries after resettlement (M = 58. 67; SD = 6.25).},

Abstract = {We study how an intervention combining youth intergroup contact and
   sports affects intergroup relations in the context of an active
   conflict. We first conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of
   one-year program exposure in Israel. To track effects of a multiyear
   exposure, we then use machine-learning techniques to fuse the RCT with
   the observational data gathered on multiyear participants. This
   analytical approach can help overcome frequent limitations of RCTs, such
   as modest sample sizes and short observation periods. Our evidence
   cannot affirm a one-year effect on outgroup regard and ingroup
   regulation, although we estimate benefits of multiyear exposure among
   Jewish-Israeli youth, particularly boys. We discuss implications for
   interventions in contexts of active conflict and group status asymmetry.},

Abstract = {Epistemic democratic theory often focuses on defending democracy from
   various forms of elitism, such as epistocracy. However, democracy's
   informational properties may also be compared with those of the market,
   and not other forms of political decision-making. While Kevin Elliott's
   critique of the market's epistemic properties is a welcome contribution
   that broadens the range of comparisons epistemic democratic theory
   engages with, Elliott mischaracterizes arguments made by market
   theorists, overlooks their justifications for employing unrealistic
   assumptions, and ignores instances where they agree with his critiques
   and arguments. This paper examines arguments regarding the epistemology
   of democracy and the market, and discusses the comparative knowledge
   requirements each competitive system requires of its participants within
   the wider context of epistemic democratic theory.},

Abstract = {The civil service is a creation of the state and not of any social or
   economic forces and has no organic relationship to society. Therefore,
   when a new state is established a new civil service is also demanded. In
   the aftermath of the Russian Revolution and the First World War, the
   civil service of the defeated imperial regimes was dealing with this
   reality. In Ireland, a parallel process of state destruction and
   state-building occurred. However, unlike the post-Versailles states, the
   Irish Free State achieved remarkable stability despite experiencing a
   civil war. It has been proposed that one reason for that stability was
   that the government of the new state maintained the civil service of the
   former regime and so ensured continuity in the administration. By
   reconstructing the experience of the civil service in the period of the
   Irish revolution that view is challenged.},

Abstract = {Among the many promises made by politicians to their constituents, job
   creation is universal. Do firms strategically use job creation to exert
   influence? We take this question to the universe of firms in the United
   States between 1997 and 2018, linking each subsidiary to a congressional
   district. We find that firms open subsidiaries in more competitive
   districts, suggesting that firms employ politicians' constituents as a
   political strategy to build ties with vulnerable legislators. These
   patterns are also consistent with electorally insecure politicians
   exerting more effort to attract firms. Unlike other tools of political
   influence available to a firm, such as campaign contributions and
   lobbying, job creation is constrained by geography and time. We show
   that these patterns exist only for firms in geographically flexible
   industries, that local job creation increases a politician's electoral
   survival, and that subsidiary investments are correlated with longer
   tenures on valuable congressional committees.},

Abstract = {Latin American democracies have gone through a series of perfect storms
   over the recent years. In what ways have these challenges transformed
   the institutional infrastructure of democracy? How have institutional
   reforms impacted the democratic prospects? This review article analyzes
   four recent edited volumes that approach the problems of institutional
   change against the backdrop of the multiple crises unfolding throughout
   the region. It describes two modes through which the reforms of
   political institutions have had an ambivalent or outright negative
   effect on the quality of democracy, and assesses the resilience of
   political institutions. Arguing for a more prominent role of informal
   institutions and political parties in institutional analyses, the
   article suggests that changes in formal political institutions have had
   a limited impact vis-\& agrave;-vis the profound changes in political
   cleavages, culture wars, swift changes in religious identities and the
   decline of political parties.},

Abstract = {This article examines the Whig Party's conception of the presidency and
   argues that it failed to take hold because the idea of an executive
   which is subordinate or deferential to the legislative branch is
   fundamentally at odds with the Constitution. To show this, I assess the
   four presidents from the Whig Party: William Henry Harrison, John Tyler,
   Zachary Taylor, and Millard Fillmore. Each of these presidents entered
   office supporting the Whigs' ideological vision of legislative supremacy
   and weak executive power, yet quickly abandoned that vision once in
   office. I contend that this demonstrates the constitutional logic of the
   presidency and the way it shapes the officeholder's perspective,
   orienting presidents toward a robust understanding of executive power.
   In short, presidents do not act like Whigs because the Constitution
   directs them not to.},

Abstract = {Large literatures focus on voter reactions to parties' policy
   strategies, agency, or legislative performance. While many inquiries
   make explicit assumptions about the direction and magnitude of voter
   flows between parties, comparative empirical analyses of vote switching
   remain rare. In this article, we overcome three challenges that have
   previously impeded the comparative study of dynamic party competition
   based on voter flows: we present a novel conceptual framework for
   studying voter retention, defection, and attraction in multiparty
   systems, showcase a newly compiled data infrastructure that marries
   comparative vote switching data with information on party behavior and
   party systems in over 250 electoral contexts, and introduce a
   statistical model that renders our conceptual framework operable. These
   innovations enable first-time inquiries into the polyadic vote switching
   patterns underlying multiparty competition and unlock major research
   potentials on party competition and party system change.},

Abstract = {Does war enhance or impede the long-term community-level development of
   social capital? While wartime mobilization and collective-action efforts
   might strengthen social ties, extreme destruction can potentially erase
   these effects. We use historical aerial photographs taken after the
   indiscriminate firebombing of Tokyo during World War II to measure
   conditionally independent microvariation in neighborhood-level damage
   and investigate the relationship between the amount of damage sustained
   and the present-day strength of neighborhood associations, a key
   indicator of geographically rooted social capital. Even after decades of
   population recovery, economic growth, and transformations of the urban
   space, the most heavily damaged neighborhoods continue to have less
   organized neighborhood associations and also exhibit lower socioeconomic
   well-being in terms of education, occupation, and residential stability.
   These findings are consistent with the idea that the social capital of
   survivors is a crucial ingredient for postwar recovery: when fewer
   survivors remain, communities can potentially be set on a path of
   persistent disadvantage.},

Abstract = {The party politics literature suggests that an institutionalized party
   system can be key for well-functioning democracies. Do the benefits of
   strong parties also extend to women's descriptive representation? We
   argue that increasing parties' strength can perpetuate and even
   intensify parties' preexisting patterns of exclusion of particular
   groups, including women, when elites are gender biased. While stronger
   parties are better able to carry out their organizational goals, we
   contend that increasing gender equity is often not part of such goals.
   To evaluate this argument, we combine an exogenous electoral reform that
   increased parties' ability to control their members in Brazil with a
   regression discontinuity design. We find that while the reform increased
   parties' ability to pursue their organizational goals, it increased the
   gap in votes between men and women. Further, we demonstrate that the
   behavior of men toward women copartisans drives this pattern. These
   findings highlight the unintended consequences of institutional
   engineering.},

Title = {Discovering optimal ballot wording using adaptive survey design},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Survey researchers are sometimes tasked with sifting through possible
   ways of phrasing a question in order to discover the wording that
   maximizes the proportion of respondents who answer in a particular way.
   One example occurs when a political interest group seeks to phrase a
   ballot measure on a given topic in a way that will garner as much voter
   support as possible. The present study illustrates how adaptive sample
   allocation can be used quickly and efficiently for this purpose. Using
   the example of a ballot measure on ranked choice voting, we show that
   adaptive design was better suited to identify the most promising ballot
   wording than a more conventional static design. We provide an
   open-source software R package and instructions for survey researchers
   seeking to implement adaptive experiments.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the short- and long-term consequences of armed
   conflict and displacement on social cohesion among citizens within
   attacked nations, using Ukraine and Bosnia and Herzegovina as case
   studies. Through a pre-registered vignette study in Ukraine (December
   2022; N = 1,623), we reveal a significant difference in social cohesion
   between those who stayed in the country during the war and those who
   left. This difference intensified when those who left did not want to
   return. A similar difference persists in Bosnia and Herzegovina 30 years
   after the Bosnian War (May 2023, N = 338), despite extensive
   reconciliation efforts. Our findings point towards an understudied
   consequence of armed conflict and displacement on social cohesion within
   the attacked nation and shed light on the challenges to post-war
   reconciliation.},

Abstract = {This research discusses one of the most important crimes against
   humanity, where national Abstract and international statistics and
   reports revealed that the bad living conditions or bad troubled
   situations have forced thousands of women, children and men in their
   countries to be susceptible to the trafficking and exploitation. The
   study has been divided into two main sections. The first section
   presents concept of the trafficking in persons in international charters
   and conventions, reasons, seriousness and elements of the crime in
   general. The second section studies the Saudi lawmaker's addressing the
   crime in terms of definition, forms, prescribed penalty and reasons for
   augmentation of penalty. The study has concluded to a set of results and
   recommendations, the most important of which is that the Saudi lawmaker
   adopted position of the international conventions in defining crime and
   determining its forms. Moreover, the Kingdom has also made great strides
   in combating this type of crime at both international and local levels.
   The study recommended the need to impose harsh penalties on employers,
   who practice patterns of forced slavery to their workers, as well as the
   need to intensify efforts in order to take adequate measures to prevent
   smuggling the illegal labor.},

Abstract = {Since the 1990s, there has been consensus in the literature of a
   submission and publication gap that favors men. Important research in
   the intervening years has explored the many reasons for this output gap:
   imbalanced administrative workloads; bias in top journals against
   female-dominated subfields and methodological approaches; and lower
   confidence levels among women, sometimes known as the ``Matthew
   effect.{''} However, in the intervening period, there has been a notable
   emphasis on recruiting more women into academia, and the importance of
   publishing for career development has intensified. Journal case studies
   have highlighted a growth in output by women academics but show that men
   are still overrepresented. Using a case study of the International
   Political Science Review (IPSR), we contribute to the emerging body of
   work that shows that the gender gap has diminished or even been
   eliminated. We present data on submissions and acceptances by gender,
   and we base our comparisons in the gender balance of the departments of
   submitting authors. The results are clear, for IPSR, the gender gap has
   closed and women now publish on a par with their men colleagues in their
   department.},

Abstract = {For decades, television has dominated political advertising, but that is
   changing due to the rise of advertising online and on social and digital
   media. How do people view online political advertising and how does this
   compare to their views of television advertising? To address these
   questions, we examine a nationally representative survey of 1200 U.S.
   adults that was fielded in February 2021. The survey contains an
   experiment in which the description of advertising (generic, television,
   or online) is altered. We find, in general, that people view online
   advertising more favorably than television advertising. We also find
   that, in some instances, age influences views of advertising. This study
   provides some of the first evidence of how Americans view online
   political advertising. Understanding what people think about online
   advertising can shed light on the potential impacts of online ad
   exposure, such as persuasion and participation, and people's attitudes
   toward online advertising should inform proposals for its regulation.},

Abstract = {Autocrats selectively tolerate political criticism, which may erode
   regime support. The literature suggests that regimes contain criticism
   by encouraging more supportive voices, but the mechanisms remain
   unclear. We theorize two mechanisms: winning more supporters
   (persuasion) or mobilizing existing supporters to speak out
   (mobilization). These mechanisms can be created by censoring evidence
   that supports criticism and adopting propaganda to arouse nationalism or
   promise material gains. We conducted two survey experiments in China
   with a novel measurement of supporter mobilization: respondents' written
   defenses against criticism. We find evidence of a mobilization mechanism
   but not persuasion. Censoring facts strongly encourages supportive
   comments. Ideological propaganda's effects are moderate, whereas
   propaganda on material benefits has no effect.},

Abstract = {Empirical findings on the origins of political trust among adolescents
   are limited and tend to understand political trust as unidimensional.
   Building on recent research capturing the importance of conceptualizing
   political trust as a two-dimensional construct, the present study aims
   to investigate origins of trust in order and representative institutions
   among adolescents, using three theoretical frameworks: social capital,
   procedural fairness, and critical citizen theory. It draws on data from
   a representative sample of eight-grade students across 15 European
   countries that participated in the International Civic and Citizenship
   Education Study (ICCS) 2016. Multilevel analyses show that positive
   relationships with peers and feeling fairly treated by teachers are
   strong, positive predictors of both dimensions of political trust and
   affect European adolescents in a uniform way. The effect of civic
   knowledge varies by country characteristics, becoming more positive with
   lower levels of public sector corruption. Overall, our findings confirm
   the validity of both rational and cultural approaches in explaining
   political trust among young emerging citizens across Europe.
   Implications for teachers and civic education practices are discussed.},

Abstract = {The article explores the positioning of the political elite of a
   marginalized minority community in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The
   co-option of Pasmanda elites within the BJP has seemingly transformed
   the nature of Pasmanda politics. The article argues that the
   non-ideological assertion of the Pasmanda elites leaves little room for
   politics of autonomy. These elites are drawn from the newly-educated,
   self-interested, middle class amongst the Pasmanda. They draw a
   distinction between the political, social and cultural needs of the
   community. They attempt to invoke politics for developmental gains,
   keeping aside the cultural and social predicaments of the Muslim
   community within the hegemonic Hindutva politics of the BJP. The old
   agenda of democratizing Muslim politics has been replaced by promoting
   the individual interest of the new Pasmanda elite. For the BJP, Pasmanda
   is a tool that enables inclusive political posturing.},

Abstract = {In surveys, Europeans routinely express high levels of support for a
   common security and defence policy of the European Union. Do these
   responses reflect real demands or superficial support that would crumble
   if the issue was politicised? This article provides new answers to this
   question. We conducted pre-registered survey experiments with more than
   40,000 respondents from 25 European countries in which we randomly
   varied whether respondents received information about potential costs of
   two hypothetical cooperative activities: military operations and defence
   procurement. Support for these activities was systematically lower when
   costs were mentioned. We conclude that, in the event of politicisation,
   there is considerable potential for shifts in opinion and that caution
   is required in deriving a mandate for specific activities from high
   approval rates for cooperation in general.},

Abstract = {The historic diaspora diplomacy literature has generally characterized
   politically active diaspora as foreign agents leveraged by their
   ancestral homeland to shape the foreign policy of their host nation. As
   such, diaspora groups have generally been assessed as net negatives on
   the foreign policy of their host nations, or as working against the
   common good of the host nation. This work seeks to challenge this narrow
   conceptualization and demonstrate that, when considered within a broader
   historical timeline, granted agency, and contextualized within a
   networked society, emergent mechanisms for state mobilization of
   diaspora groups to achieve foreign policy objectives become apparent.
   This work is focused exclusively on political diaspora groups within the
   United States and investigates select case studies to demonstrate the
   evolving nature of U.S.-diaspora relations and the opportunities
   presented as a result. The work concludes with several policy
   recommendations, derived from lessons learned within the case studies.},

Abstract = {Prior work examines how organization resources and types shape venue
   selection strategies. Both Congress and executive branch agencies can
   change policy, so interest groups must consider which of these venues to
   lobby on a given issue. We argue that factors in the political
   environment-venues' issue priorities and the power of groups' allies in
   a venue-influence how groups with different resource constraints select
   lobbying venues. Examining over one million issue-level lobbying
   disclosures filed between 2008 and 2016, we find that low-resource
   groups strategically lobby the venue(s) controlled by partisan allies
   and respond to the government's and public's issue priorities.
   Meanwhile, high-resource groups more often lobby all venues relevant to
   their issues regardless of the political environment, especially on
   issues gaining significant attention within government but not in the
   public. Our findings suggest that separation of powers provides
   high-resource groups more venues to lobby for favored policies.
   Conversely, low-resource groups strategically only lobby venues they
   have the potential to influence.},

Abstract = {Existing research primarily delves into the demand side of electoral
   manipulation, focusing on the conditions prompting political elites to
   rig the process. Recent studies have shifted focus towards the supply
   side, employing the principal-agent approach to investigate how agents
   engage in election tampering based on their principals' likelihood of
   success. While this perspective has highlighted the role of agents in
   determining manipulation intensity, gaps remain in understanding how
   they predict their principals' victory and strategically decide on
   active or passive manipulation. Our argument centres on agents using the
   economy as a critical indicator of their principals' electoral
   prospects. A strong economy boosts incumbents' chances of success and
   their vote share, prompting agents to be more blatant in engaging in
   electoral misconduct, leading to heightened manipulation. Analysing 1278
   multiparty elections across 94 countries since the 1900s, our findings
   suggest that incumbent electoral prospects correlate with economic
   indicators and significantly influence the scale of electoral
   manipulation.},

   This can range from parliamentary representation (as with the Church of

   Scotland's annual General Assembly). Since the 1960s there have been
   proposals regarding Crown appointments and the number and status of the
   Lords Spiritual. There exists no major push for full disestablishment of
   the Church of England, but a bill is currently before Parliament.},

Abstract = {In this paper we focus on the political communication activities of the
   candidates of the radical left parties (RLPs), emphasizing their
   campaign activities during electioneering. We aim to address three key
   questions. First, we seek to understand what type of political
   communication activities RLP candidates use. Second, we undertake a
   comparative analysis, contrasting these activities with those employed
   by candidates and MPs from other party families in order to identify any
   notable distinctions. Third, we explore the thematic emphasis of their
   campaign activities and whether it aligns with the commonly held
   perception of RLPs as less individualistic, particularly in light of the
   prevailing trend towards increased personalization in politics. Our data
   come from the Comparative Candidates Survey (CCS) and cover 16 European
   countries over the years spanning from 2005 to 2017. In sum, the
   findings present a nuanced perspective and do not conclusively
   demonstrate a distinctly unique type of candidate of the radical left.},

Abstract = {How does the potential for socialization affect states' abilities to
   reassure each other and mitigate the security dilemma? Rationalist
   scholarship has identified numerous mechanisms by which states can
   credibly signal benign intentions. Yet it omits the possibility that
   states' interactions might endogenously shape their identities and
   domestic structures, and thus alter their basic preferences for or
   against cooperative outcomes. We present a formal model of the security
   dilemma that allows the sender's preferences to change endogenously as a
   function of the receiver's actions. The model yields several key
   results. First, the possibility of socialization generates incentives
   for benign actors to risk initiating cooperation, and even sustain
   cooperation in response to noncooperative signals in the hope of
   positively socializing the sender. However, conflict can still occur
   between mutually benign states through novel mechanisms not captured by
   standard models. These findings carry important implications for recent
   debates surrounding the US ``engagement{''} strategy toward China.},

Abstract = {In the first section of the article, we deal with the relationship that
   Karl Korsch maintained with the Institute for Social Research and its
   most representative figures, from its first years of operation in
   Frankfurt to exile in the United States (1). In the second part, a
   contrast is carried out between what Korsch and the first Critical
   Theory understood by `realization of philosophy' (2). An annex
   structured around three additional themes is added: the reception of
   positivism in Korsch's work (a), its link with Leninism (b) and his
   criticism of the `theory of collapse `(Zusammenbruchstheorie) (c).},

   theory today. We will focus on questions such as ideology, the diagnosis
   of reification and the critique of positivism. In doing so, we will
   confront ourselves with the topicality of these works, which are
   fundamental for Western Marxism, on the 100th anniversary of their
   publication.},

Abstract = {This article provides a comparative analysis between the local
   government structure and operations in the Federation of Malaysia and
   Australian local government. In doing so, literature will be referenced
   where relevant to the application of local government legislation in the
   Federation of Malaysia to Australian local government as well as
   reference data from several case studies of selected Malaysian local
   governments in regard to how the system of local government legislation
   in Malaysia compares to local government legislation in Australia. In
   particular, this will also include a comparison between the legislative
   arrangements of the Malaysian Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur and
   Putrajaya that are governed directly by the federal government and the
   Australian non-self governing external territories of Christmas Island,
   Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Norfolk Island. The article will not only
   provide an historical account of the development of local government in
   the Federation of Malaysia to the present day, but also place this
   narrative in a comparative context with the Australian local government
   contemporary environment. In doing so, the local government community
   (sector) in Australia can/should consider the opportunities in the
   Malaysian local government sector for any application to the Australian
   local government system that would have positive benefits. These
   opportunities are further explored throughout the applicable sections of
   this article.},

Title = {Understanding institutional layers and modes of change for energy
   transitions: Analysis of Norway's electricity sector reforms},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},
Pages = {122-149},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Institutions have significant implications for whether and how energy
   systems restructure, evolve, and successfully transition. Yet,
   literature analyzing energy sector reforms often approach transitions
   from economic or technical perspectives, with much less attention to the
   underlying roles and influences of institutions. This paper explores the
   roles and influence of institutions on the speed, direction, timing, and
   sequence of energy transitions. A conceptual framework integrating the
   hierarchy of institutions with an historical institutionalist approach
   is developed and applied to explore transitions in Norway's electricity
   sector as a case study. Results show that conversion followed by
   layering emerge as the dominant modes of institutional change in
   Norway's electricity sector reform, illustrating the importance of
   alignment between institutions in creating the conditions for
   large-scale energy transitions and the importance of boundaries to
   maintain alignment between levels of institutions. Governments can
   minimize potential gaps between transition intentions and outcomes
   through effective conversion and layering of institutional arrangements,
   but layering challenges emerge when institutional change introduces new
   actors or energy arenas to existing policy paradigms.},

   international law, the parallel binaries and pluralities in
   international law, and the relevance and capabilities of international
   humanitarian law regarding legal identity under insurgencies and
   unrecognised states. I suggest that the critique offered by the
   multi-/inter-disciplinary approaches in this Special Issue highlights
   international law's limits given the realities of the issuance of
   identity documentation by non-state entities. At the same time,
   precisely by illuminating those practical realities, this collection
   alerts us to the accompanying nuances existing in the law. Through this
   entry point, we are encouraged back, better-equipped, to international
   law and to better understand where and how it can already cope with
   greater complexity and compromise than might often be assumed. It allows
   us to place real demands on the law to prove itself as relevant and
   capable of protecting people, somehow holding together that paradox of
   universal principle and grounded application.},

Abstract = {The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) was home to some of the most vocal
   and steadfast supporters of the Presidency of Donald J. Trump. Drawing
   on a diverse range of sources, including interviews with those
   supporters, this paper accounts for the good relations between the DUP
   and Trump. That account highlights several commonalities, including
   their `Orangeism', their stance on Brexit, their illiberalism, and their
   populism. As well as its nature, we also assess Trump's impact on the
   behaviour and development of the DUP. We show how the Trump presidency
   fuelled a populist revival within the party, providing in the process an
   important update to existing accounts of its modernisation journey. That
   revival, we conclude, encourages greater cognisance of the DUP's
   populist credentials and ongoing scrutiny of the factional tensions
   within it, tied as those are to the prospects of political unionism.},

Title = {Life and growth of the Thirteen Marxist Feminist Theses},
Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2, SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The fourth international Marxist feminist conference was the most
   international and best attended with around 700 participants, including
   Silvia Federici, Nancy Fraser, Tithi Bhattacharya, Lorena Cabnal, Ochy
   Curiel, Ana Cecilia Dinerstein, Elsa Dorlin, Jules Falquet, and Frigga
   Haug. The main themes of the panels established continuity with the
   previous conferences, from debates on intersectionality which overlap in
   various fields with practical and theoretical issues such as value, the
   state, law, care, production, and social reproduction to those that were
   closely linked to the thinking of new organizations and repertoires of
   struggle. This Special Issue is based on the plenary titled: the
   Thirteen Theses of Marxist Feminism. Frigga Haug, the author of The
   Thirteen Theses, considers all of them in her opening interview. The
   most widely debated theses by the Special Issue contributors are Theses

Abstract = {Recent scholarship within queer international political economy (IPE)
   has highlighted the intimate links between sexuality and capitalism, as
   well as the insights offered by queer approaches to the study of the
   global economy. This article critically advances this literature by
   examining the political economic foundations and facets of trans
   oppression. Against the backdrop of an (anti-) `trans culture war' in
   the United Kingdom, gender-critical and other transexclusionary feminist
   discourse has sought to cleave trans people from class struggle and to
   portray trans activism as separate from, and in conflict with, the goals
   of the feminist movement. This discourse, I contend, is indicative of a
   broader lack of understanding about the ways in which trans oppression
   links to other forms of gender oppression under capitalism. The article
   argues that feminist IPE, and specifically social reproduction
   approaches, offer a powerful toolbox with which to illuminate the
   material bases of gendered, racialised and sexualised inequalities
   within the global economy, including those experienced by trans people,
   and to uncover their co-constitutive character. However, theorising
   trans oppression in/through feminist IPE will require scholars to engage
   more deeply with queer and trans theorising, specifically accounts of
   heteronormativity and the body, and to relinquish the cis-normative
   attachments that shape some accounts of gender, capitalism and social
   reproduction, notably within the Marxist feminist tradition.},

Abstract = {This article problematizes the concept of ``security{''} within the
   concept of ``citizen security{''} employed by Mexico, through a feminist
   security studies critique. Considering feminist security studies
   critiques that often see security as ultimately tied to militarization,
   regardless of the security referent, this article shows how this problem
   surfaces in Mexico's National Action Plan for Women, Peace, and Security
   and in the claim that Mexico has adopted a feminist foreign policy. Not
   only do these initiatives largely ignore high rates of femicide and
   other forms of state and nonstate violence in Mexico, but they are also
   reproductive of violence, particularly militarized violence, in their
   attachments to security. The article delves into the literature on how
   Mexico and other states domestically inimical to feminist movements have
   instituted national action plans that militarize the women, peace, and
   security agenda, embraced feminist foreign policies as they have further
   militarized, or both, often promulgating plans with little or no input
   from civil society. Mexico is revealed as a Janus-faced example where
   seemingly liberal feminist values are promoted abroad but are not
   implemented at home. Thus, the nation is refashioning itself as a ``good
   global citizen{''} at the expense of implementing and expanding citizen
   (and noncitizen) rights and protections within its borders.},

Abstract = {Survey experiments often yield intention-to-treat effects that are
   either statistically and/or practically ``non-significant.{''} There has
   been a commendable shift toward publishing such results, either to avoid
   the ``file drawer problem{''} and/or to encourage studies that conclude
   in favor of the null hypothesis. But how can researchers more
   confidently adjudicate between true, versus erroneous, nonsignificant
   results? Guidance on this critically important question has yet to be
   synthesized into a single, comprehensive text. The present essay
   therefore highlights seven ``alternative explanations{''} that can lead
   to (erroneous) nonsignificant findings. It details how researchers can
   more rigorously anticipate and investigate these alternative
   explanations in the design and analysis stages of their studies, and
   also offers recommendations for subsequent studies. Researchers are thus
   provided with a set of strategies for better designing their
   experiments, and more thoroughly investigating their survey-experimental
   data, before concluding that a given result is indicative of ``no
   significant effect.{''}},

Abstract = {Australian local government does not enjoy the status of its
   counterparts in comparable democracies and has long sought
   acknowledgment in the federal constitution. As these campaigns have
   consistently failed, this study considers how, and in which forms, local
   government obtains its own political legitimacy within a governance
   system centered on the citizen-state relationship, in addition to
   evaluating the relationships between the different forms of legitimacy.
   We find that positive perceptions of local government effectiveness are
   associated with higher levels of support for constitutional change, but
   that local governments need to pay more attention to systems of
   accountability and oversight, how building and planning issues are
   handled, and how they communicate with residents. Generally, and
   unsurprisingly, local government is appreciated more by those who rely
   on their services yet who are not always the loudest voices in public
   debates. Constitutional legitimacy is more likely when other sources of
   legitimacy are enhanced.},

Title = {Deepening the rift: Negative campaigning fosters affective polarization
   in multiparty elections},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {87},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper contributes to a growing body of literature on affective
   polarization by examining the understudied role of party rhetoric on
   partisan divides in the electorate. Despite a recent growth of research
   on affective polarization in multiparty systems, no study tests the
   effect of negative campaigning on affective polarization outside the US.
   This paper tests whether negative campaigning between parties during
   electoral campaigns is associated with higher levels of affective
   polarization. Combining data from the CSES and an expert survey on party
   rhetoric, we analyze data from sixteen countries (seventeen elections)
   and eighty-six parties, and present the first large scale analysis of
   the effect of party rhetoric on affective polarization. Our results show
   that affective polarization is larger between parties adopting a
   negative tone. We also show more specifically that affective
   polarization is higher for individuals whose party attacks or is
   attacked by the other party. In addition, we find that the positive
   association between attacks and affective polarization increases with
   partisan strength.},

Title = {Everyday immigration ethics: Colombia, Venezuela and the case for
   vernacular response},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 12},
Abstract = {In the last decade, Venezuelans have faced a range of challenges such
   that by 2023, nearly 7.2 million have fled, the vast majority hosted
   within the region. One country particularly stands out: Colombia has
   accepted over 2.5 million. Colombia's behaviour does not appear
   motivated by legal obligations or universal ethical principles; it is
   hard to make sense of in terms of international ethical and political
   theory. Rather, Colombian state and society make reference to mundane,
   localised concepts of friendship, fraternity and the reciprocity of a
   shared history. Such everyday ethics is generally ignored in existing
   debates. I argue that immigration ethics could helpfully begin from
   concrete, everyday ethical behaviour rather than idealisation and
   abstraction. Instead of initially asking what states and societies
   should do regarding immigration, we could ask what do they already do,
   why and how? This article therefore explores how Colombian politicians
   and civil society actors understood their welcoming actions through an
   awareness of entangled histories, reciprocity, friendship and
   solidarity: everyday, vernacular ways in which responsibility-taking is
   rationalised and practiced. My argument is not that Colombia's actions
   are normatively right, or an enactment of immigration justice. Rather,
   these actions were ambivalent: the messy, pragmatic result of
   negotiating different, competing responsibilities, principles and
   emotions. The results were imperfect, heavily gendered, but also
   unprecedented. Those advocating greater societal responsibility for
   immigrants would perhaps do best to look beyond the global north, shun
   the universal and start from local activities founded in vernacular,
   everyday ethics.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes how autocratic parties sustain and adjust
   electoral manipulative tactics to maintain electoral dominance in
   multi-level elections. It examines continuities and changes in electoral
   authoritarianism in Ethiopia by comparing elections held under the EPRDF
   and Prosperity Party (PP). The 2021 elections, marred by the detention
   of main opposition leaders, war and opposition boycotts, resulted in a
   dominant victory for the incumbent (PP), showing continuity of electoral
   dominance. Analysis of election data since 1995 shows that elections
   under PP were more competitive than the last two elections under the
   EPRDF in terms of opposition votes and seat share. Further, the analysis
   indicates regional asymmetry in electoral competition and opposition
   success, which is explained by asymmetric authoritarianism,
   ethnonationalism, and regional political dynamics. Despite this, the
   incumbent garnered public support through targeted rhetoric, addressing
   regional demands, and reframing historical narratives. These dynamics
   have implications for Ethiopia's future and state-society relations.
   Insights from Ethiopia have implications for multi-ethnic federations
   facing challenges of democratization while highlighting the empirical
   need for a nuanced understanding of region-specific contexts to
   understand democratization challenges in ethnically diverse states.},

Abstract = {How are military peacekeepers trained to undertake the Protection of

   focussing on how `contact skills' are integrated into the UN's flagship
   PoC training progammes through learner-centred `elicitive' forms of
   training. The article outlines theoretical and policy considerations
   which advocate more complex training in this domain, before exploring
   the programmes. It then critically analyses the challenges of
   systematically standardising elicitive forms of peacekeeper training.
   The article makes a strong contribution to studies of peacekeeper
   training and to debates on the preparation of peacekeepers for
   deployment to complex environments where civilian protection is
   paramount.},

Abstract = {This piece reflects, takes stock, and imagines future developments in
   gender equality and diversity in the Scottish legal profession while
   highlighting areas for improvement. It is an appraisal of the work still
   needed to truly diversify the legal profession, and a chance to
   spotlight widening participation and social mobility while critiquing
   the need for more and deeper work to make the next steps of progress
   that we need to. More than 100 years after the first women graduated
   with law degrees, where are we now? We now have more women studying and
   practising law than at any other time in history, but they are still not
   reaching the higher levels in the same numbers as the men. There is
   also, crucially, intersectionality to consider and how much more
   difficult it is for, e.g., a woman with a disability, or a woman of

Abstract = {This article examines the work experiences of trans women in hair
   salons, one of the few job opportunities along with prostitution. The
   close relationship between both activities in Ecuador and other Latin
   American contexts is highlighted. Hierarchies of gender, race, sexuality
   and class influence these dynamics, reproducing the exclusion of bodies
   that do not conform to heteronormativity. The work shows that hair
   salons run by LGBTQ+ people not only offer employment, they also
   function as refuges from family violence and educational and labor
   exclusions. Encountering support networks facilitates job placement and
   improvements in social mobility, although the majority still face
   exclusion and hate crimes. The pandemic accentuated the closure of hair
   salons, historically known as << Consolation Centers >>, refuges for
   sexual dissidents. However, the emotional work of trans hairdressers
   contrasts with the decline of these spaces.},

   illustrated, as it can in many ways also be an illustration of the
   laborious making of a genuinely European (though not only) political
   science from the ashes of World War 2, and the failures (uncertainties)
   of pre-WWII political science. Here it will briefly be recalled how an
   enthusiastic and innovative institution builder gained a central place
   in the making of the new European political science, and how Blondel
   coupled this with his tireless exploration of new fields of comparative
   politics, while being at the same time a generous mentor of PhD students
   and younger scholars and, for many, a great friend.},

Abstract = {We analyse the impact of International Monetary Fund (IMF) programmes on
   appointing women leaders in ministerial positions. We hypothesize that
   women leaders are selected after an incumbent government starts an IMF
   programme to shift accountability to them during political and economic
   turmoil. This political manoeuvring of appointing women to leadership
   positions during a crisis is known as the `glass cliff' effect. We
   demonstrate substantial evidence for such a `glass cliff' effect using
   data covering all IMF programmes from 1980 to 2018. Our evidence shows
   that women are more likely to be appointed to austerity-bearing
   ministerial positions under IMF programmes but not in positions of
   authority during negotiations with the IMF. This effect is more
   pronounced when a country displays worse societal gender norms, a higher
   level of corruption and a government facing a deeper economic crisis.
   Importantly, we verify that neither women's leadership nor a higher
   share of women in government predicts a balance of payments crisis
   triggering an IMF programme. In other words, women leaders do not govern
   worse; they are appointed to leadership positions in precarious,
   crisis-ridden conditions.},

Abstract = {The global political trend of restricting reproductive rights produces
   fragmented landscapes and embodied experiences for women navigating
   shifting terrain. This raises questions concerning the conceptualisation
   of reproductive citizenship. We develop a theoretical framework inspired
   by the concept of embodied citizenship with which we analyse the
   sensing, management and negotiation of reproductive citizenship. We find
   that women relationally, bodily and geographically (re)negotiate their
   reproductive citizenship when considering and securing access to
   abortion. In the context of the Faroe Islands, we highlight the
   emotional tension and ambivalence in women's narratives as expressions
   of the constrained reproductive citizenship constructions and the
   interrelational experiences of threatened belonging in society. This
   analytical framework may prove useful for researchers wishing to examine
   the turbulent global reproductive landscape, and the geographic, bodily
   and relational means through which women seeking care negotiate their
   citizenship.},

Abstract = {How does vote choice and partisanship affect institutional trust in
   Taiwan? While the literature tackles institutional trust in democracies,
   analyses often focus on only one time period with aggregate measures of
   trust. Data from two waves from the Asian Barometer finds evidence
   consistent with losers' consent of trust in electoral institutions
   corresponding with party support and vote choice, factors that remain
   after controlling for trust in non-electoral institutions and
   generalized trust. However, these factors do not seem to affect overall
   satisfaction with democracy, suggesting the public differentiates
   between support for the ideal of democracy and its constituent parts.},

Abstract = {This research delves into the abundant landscape of party positioning
   data, highlighting a scarcity of interconnected voter and party
   positioning sources. Leveraging Voting Advice Applications (VAAs), this
   study explores congruence from a comparative standpoint, capturing
   political preferences on the same scale and timeframe. Analysing data
   from two pan-European VAAs, EU Profiler and euandi, congruence is
   evaluated based on voter's alignment with their preferred party across
   three issue dimensions. Findings underscore varying linkage strengths,
   particularly evident in a narrower representation on cultural and gender
   issues compared to economic ones. The study underscores the advantages
   of VAA data, urging a shift beyond the left-right continuum for a
   comprehensive understanding of party-voter congruence in a dynamic
   political landscape.},

Abstract = {Although research methodology is a staple and essential requirement of
   many undergraduate political science programmes worldwide, there are
   still many intense and ongoing debates among teachers and students on
   the series of effective learning and teaching approaches and strategies
   for this subject matter that involve theoretical understanding,
   procedural knowledge, practical skills, and reflective mindsets. By
   undergoing a thematic analysis of the course syllabi of the
   undergraduate political science research methodology courses offered by
   seven publicly funded universities in Hong Kong, this study aims to
   first illustrate how individual teachers structure and sequence their
   courses, followed by highlighting the underlying educational
   implications. This qualitative study primarily focuses on seven distinct
   yet interrelated aspects of course design, namely course title, course
   description, intended learning outcomes, course topics and content,
   readings and references, assessment tasks, and course format. All these
   empirical findings can contribute to scholarship by offering greater
   clarity and consistency in understanding the learning and teaching of
   research methodology in the context of undergraduate political science
   education. These findings can also inform future practices in terms of
   course design, pedagogical best practices, lesson preparation, and
   assessment development among educators and practitioners.},

Abstract = {The religious veneration of Bharat Mata began with the three temples
   honouring her in the Hindu pilgrimage sites of Varanasi, Haridwar, and
   Ujjain. They symbolise the nation by anthropomorphising the territory
   and establish the relationship between nation-divine and its
   citizen-devotee through `darshan' wherein the latter is imbued with
   feelings of patriotism. By studying the narratives emerging from these
   spaces, referred to as temple publics, it has been argued that they are
   reflective of majoritarian politics, where the aim is to construct a new
   religion called nationalism, with Bharat Mata at its helm and a set of
   rituals and unique traditions.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Inclusive or exclusive? Examining the dynamics of social
   protection in Saudi Arabia (Retracted Article)},
Journal = {GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 17},
Abstract = {This article provides an analysis of social protection responses to the
   pandemic in Saudi Arabia with a focus on policies targeted at migrant
   workers. Using data from multiple pandemic-era policy tracking databases
   and other resources, we use a descriptive case study through the lens of
   comparative welfare regime theory to include a comprehensive set of
   social protection and labor market measures. We found that, in sum, the
   Saudi government expansively scaled up its social protection system in
   response to COVID-19 with 86 implemented social protection measures.
   Labor market policies in the form of wage subsidies, labor regulations,
   and activation measures were the most prevalent type of social
   protection responses used by the Saudi government, complemented by
   social assistance measures in the form of cash transfers, food,
   vouchers, utility, and financial obligation support. Social insurance
   measures such as paid sick leave, healthcare insurance, unemployment
   insurance schemes, and social security contributions were the least
   adopted. Despite its expansions, the Saudi social protection system
   continued to largely neglect non-citizens and migrant workers. Saudi
   social protection system must pivot toward the full inclusion of
   non-citizens and migrant workers. COVID-19 has highlighted systemic gaps
   in Saudi social protection systems. It has magnified some of the
   country's critical social protection challenges, which can inform future
   crisis response and the development of social protection systems.},

Abstract = {The accountability relationship between voters and elected members of
   Congress (MCs) hinges on the potential for citizens to learn about
   legislator behaviour. In an era of declining local newspapers, local
   television coverage of MCs potentially fulfils this important role.
   However, few studies have comprehensively examined the determinants of
   contemporary MC coverage by local television news broadcasts. In this
   paper, we leverage a vast database of local television news broadcast
   transcripts spanning two years to identify which factors explain MC
   coverage. We find that MCs receive little coverage outside the general
   election campaign season. Media market and campaign-specific factors are
   associated with more exposure when coverage occurs. Finally, we find
   that within competitive elections, incumbents receive only a marginal
   advantage in coverage. These findings provide a springboard to explore
   further questions regarding Congress, local media, and political
   accountability.},

Abstract = {Chile's 2021-22 Constitutional Convention was the first in the world to
   feature mechanisms that guaranteed gender parity among constituents
   (Arce and Suarez-Cao 2021). This was not an easy win. Feminist activists
   and women politicians pushed for gender parity in 2020-21 in a country
   that had adopted gender quotas relatively late (Figueroa 2021;
   Reyes-Housholder, Suarez-Cao, and Le Foulon 2023; Suarez-Cao 2023;
   personal interview \#1, April 21, 2023). Reserving seats for Indigenous
   groups and using other mechanisms to allow space for independent
   constituents further broadened the convention's ostensible
   inclusiveness. After the September 2022 rejection of the 2021-22
   Constitutional Convention's draft, political parties immediately started
   over by crafting an elite-controlled process. Lawmakers-this time with
   surprising speed-again coalesced around the idea that an equal number of
   men and women should write the new draft.},

Abstract = {This article compares the authoritarian regimes of early South Korea and
   Albania, identifying historical anecdotes of state authoritarianism that
   resulted in state-led crimes and human rights violations. It identifies
   the historical connections between the establishment and maintenance of
   authoritarian regimes, as well as the consequences of such meticulous
   upkeep, by comparing and contrasting the efforts made in dealing with
   the past and lustration, as well as their significance for peace and
   stability. We compare the South Korean and Albanian cases from these
   perspectives to find similarities and differences. By comparing two
   different countries with similar authoritarian pasts, this article
   analyzes the efforts of both countries towards transitional justice, and
   unified rhetoric across the political spectrum for lustration and
   punishment of past crimes, and discovered that when it comes to
   practice, these laws tend to be unilateral and were strongly challenged
   in courts and used as political tools against ideological opponents.},

Abstract = {The Swiss People's Party emerged as the unambiguous winner of the 2023
   Swiss federal elections. Thanks to a vote share of 27.9\% obtained in
   the elections to the National Council, it managed to surpass Brothers of
   Italy to become the largest radical right party in contemporary Western
   Europe. By contrast, the Greens did not manage to confirm their
   electoral performance from 2019 and even fell below the important 10\%
   mark. Their attempt to enter government by unseating a member of the
   Liberals clearly failed in the subsequent elections to the Federal
   Council. While the partisan composition of the government remained
   unchanged, it is likely to be subject to change in the future. The rise
   of the radical right is in line with national elections that have
   recently taken place in France, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, and
   the Netherlands.},

Abstract = {Mock elections are an increasingly popular form of active learning,
   adopted in many European countries and the United States. However, we
   have limited knowledge regarding the extent to which they enhance
   students' civic competence. This article analyzes data from over 9,000
   students aged 13-19 who participated in a 2022 mock election in Sweden.
   The goal is to determine the extent to which mock elections boost civic
   competence, with an emphasis on potential variations related to gender,
   ethnic background, and educational stage. Results indicate that such
   participation positively influences students' self-reported political
   knowledge and, to a lesser extent, their political interest, engagement,
   and efficacy. Yet, the impact varies among student demographics. For
   instance, foreign-born students reported greater effects than their
   Swedish-born counterparts. Female students displayed heightened
   political knowledge and interest compared to males, while male students
   demonstrated higher political engagement. Interestingly, mock elections
   seemed to enhance political knowledge more in primary school students
   than in secondary school ones. Conversely, they had a more pronounced
   impact on the political interests and engagement of secondary school
   students. The study concludes with suggestions for future research to
   employ more rigorous methods to assess the influence of mock elections
   on civic competencies.},

Abstract = {This paper advocates a move beyond the systemic approach in the field of
   Deliberative Democracy. It argues that the notion of deliberative
   ecology can deliver the necessary conceptual elements that deliberative
   democrats seek in deliberative systems without some of the problems they
   either overlook or embrace. To advocate the advantages of an ecological
   perspective to deliberation, the article focuses on six axes of
   comparison: (i) performances of actants (instead of functions of arenas
   and players); (ii) articulations and translations (instead of
   transmission); (iii) vulnerabilities (instead of pathologies and
   dysfunctions); (iv) practice (instead of institutionally-oriented
   design); (v) diverse temporalities (instead of linear temporality) and;
   (vi) hologram-based analysis (instead of systemic analysis). In a
   nutshell, the article claims that the ecological approach to
   deliberation has the advantage of conceptualizing an ever-changing web
   of relations of interdependency, which connects diverse entities that
   are either relevant to a public discussion or that hinder its enactment.},

Title = {SYMBOLIC GEOPOLITICAL CAPITAL AND URBAN SPACE},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-88},
Abstract = {The purpose of the work is to identify a special subject area in the
   research of symbolic capital of cities - symbolic geopolitical capital -
   and to identify its connection with urban space. The author defines
   environmental symbolic resources - urban signs or symbol carriers - the
   category of symbolic geopolitical capital (SGC), reveals their structure
   based on the applied example of St. Petersburg, as well as the
   principles of interaction with the urban environment and some ways in
   which SGK in symbolic politics are determined. The material carriers of
   symbols have at least four special properties that give the actors of
   urban symbolic politics an advantage when using these carriers in a
   competitive struggle: the duration of their existence and anchoring in
   the fabric of the city; the power of nomination - ideas about their
   legitimacy and public recognition; they are more likely to be encoded by
   the consciousness of the citizen in the form of a priori ``normal{''},
   ``comfortable{''} and positive perception; and they provide the actors
   of symbolic politics with special means of political maneuver, using the
   principle of separation and variability of interpretations of such
   signs. In addition to the principles of placement described for each
   category of signs, their generalized types are highlighted: spatial
   concentration, spatial confinement, spatial hierarchy and effective
   spatial representation. The means of symbolic management using SGC are
   described, such as: all kinds of physical actions with the carriers
   themselves; activism correlated with them; producing new political
   meanings of their nominations and renominations; reinterpretation of
   existing and production of new symbols and associated signs, thereby -
   the production of new symbolic resources and the reconfiguration of the
   symbolic space of the city. Examples are given of urban conflicts
   related to geopolitical urban signs reflected in public discourse. They
   are grouped by potential sources of conflictogenicity due to the
   different attitudes of actors to: practices and manifestations of
   territorial strategies, their results and consequences; concepts and
   proposed worldviews; ideas about control over territory. A number of
   principles and patterns for the formation and use of symbolic
   geopolitical capital associated with urban space in politics are
   formulated: specialization in the nomination, the ``latent{''} nature of
   the potential for conflict inherent in the SGC, the change of
   hierarchies, stages or ``waves{''} of geopolitical symbolic policy in
   urban space, the formation of a ``geopolitical symbolic footprint{''}.},

Title = {Russia's Security Perceptions and Arctic Governance},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Russia's war in Ukraine further strained Russia's relations with the
   West and negatively influenced Arctic regional governance, especially
   after seven members of the Arctic Council paused cooperation with
   Russia. The rationale of the suspension was to express disapproval by
   seven Arctic states of Russia's aggression in Ukraine. However, the
   suspension of cooperation with Russia within the Arctic Council format
   prompted some observers to question the relevance and utility of the
   institution. Russia never expressed its wish to leave the Council and
   continues to express its desire for multilateral cooperation in the
   region. This raises the question: Can Russia's assertive stance in
   Ukraine coexist with peaceful cooperation in the Arctic? In order to
   answer this question, this article addresses the following questions:
   How does the geopolitical tension shape Russia's approach to Arctic
   governance? And what is the role of military and economic security in
   Russia's Arctic policy? The article uses a comparative method combined
   with discourse analysis to establish a change in Russia's view on Arctic
   governance before and after the war in Ukraine.},

Title = {TÜRKIYE'S MILITARY BASE IN SOMALIA: A CASE STUDY},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {At the present stage the Republic of T \& uuml;rkiye is all the more
   actively claiming the role of a regional leader and at the same time,
   using the favourable geopolitical position at the junction of two
   civilizations, seeks to strengthen influence in global politics. The
   statehood of independent states is impossible without strengthening
   their own security, and that allows for the development of international
   military dialogue. T \& uuml;rkiye as a world power is to restore its
   prosperity from the times of the Ottoman Empire. Best evidence is the
   creation of Turkish military bases beyond its national borders.
   Moreover, such actions of the Turkish leadership are considered not only
   a political ambition but also a pragmatic calculation. First overseas
   military base of T \& uuml;rkiye in modern times was created in one of
   the most turbulent countries in the world - Somalia. Currently, T \&
   uuml;rkiye has a military presence in Somalia. Hence, this study
   examined the main stages of bilateral relations between T \& uuml;rkiye
   and Somalia. Relations between the two countries have passed a certain
   historical path of development and have been characterized by periods of
   activation revival also stagnation. It was concluded that despite the
   fact that political, economic and military cooperation between T \&
   uuml;rkiye and Somalia had huge potential, there were some of
   constraining factors affecting their further development.},

Abstract = {This paper applies an Intersectionality Based Policy Analysis Framework
   to Ontario's current mental health plan - The Roadmap: A Plan to Build
   Ontario's Mental Health and Addictions Services - in order to identify
   the contextual influences, underlying values and assumptions, which
   promote or undermine the uptake of human rights and equity as a mental
   health policy priority in Ontario. We found that dominant framings of
   the ``problem{''} of mental health (as lack of access, coordination or
   integration, as a fiscal drain, as an economic burden, and as a clinical
   or medical problem) served to obscure and ignore the underlying social
   and structural conditions that impact mental health and the human rights
   violations that routinely occur in the context of ``care.{''} We discuss
   the implications of The Roadmap ignoring social and structural
   determinants of health, and by way of contrast, explore how citizen
   engagement and activism can support rethinking mental health policy so
   that it is more just and equitable.},

Abstract = {The introduction to the monographic section Politics of the Algorithm:
   Technologies, Powers, Theories , examines the nexus between technology
   and politics from the way in which the former, and algorithm-driven
   technologies in particular, has irreversibly invested the institutional
   and social coordinates within which the modern political canon has been
   constituted, activating a historical threshold in which the forms of
   social relations of domination change, the possibilities of their
   contestation by men and women who are placed in different positions in
   societal relations are determined, and the semantics of power is
   redefined overall. The ``politics of the algorithm{''} concerns how
   social relations are embedded in technology and, consequently, are
   reproduced, legitimized and institutionalized by technology. Its study
   should therefore be placed within the framework of constitutional
   history, which, at the point of connection between social and conceptual
   history, opens up the field of a conceptual history of technology.},

Abstract = {Tunisia has always been affected by terrorism, but since the late 2011s
   there has been a sharp increase in terrorism perpetrated. The object of
   this research is to analyze the socio-economic determinants of terrorism
   using terrorist attacks as a dependent variable and indicators that
   affect the level of growth in Tunisia such as explanatory variables. The
   aim of this work is to develop recommendations on how to respond to the
   state in response to terrorist shocks. The following policy implications
   were deduced. First, we must increase the level of growth of the country
   by stabilizing the policy and by controlling governance to show the
   effectiveness of the results of this study which aims at reducing
   terrorism and improving the country's economic conditions. Second, in
   view of the results found in this research, terrorism can stabilize the
   long-term labor market through investment by putting in place realistic
   economic policies that are time-bound to encourage the State to create
   vacancies for the unemployed.},

Abstract = {Considering the spatial turn in social sciences, this study aims to
   demonstrate, through a case study (urban intervention in the city of
   Madrid), the relevance of incorporating a spatial dimension into social
   studies of time, particularly as regards future imaginaries. Therefore,
   we analyze conflicting visions of a contested future. Following the
   effects of homology, the goal is to identify the occupation of specific
   social positions (as well as certain physical spaces) with attitudes
   either in favor or against the intervention in question. To achieve
   this, we conducted interviews with 5 individuals supporting the
   intervention and 5 opposing it, seeking to explain their criteria and
   motivations. Based on these interviews, we propose 4 ideal types of
   social agents based on their attitudes towards the future, distributed
   as polar types.},

Journal = {POLITOLOGIJA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {114},
Number = {2},
Pages = {81-129},
Abstract = {This article deals with the problem of the change in the theoretical
   conception and practical realisation of political representation in the
   era of big data, i.e. in the 20th and 21st century, when IT data
   processes have become an almost integral part of the political life of
   citizens. Based on the concepts of the philosophers F. Ankersmit and J.
   Baudrillard, the article analyses why, despite the arguments of critical
   data studies, the forms of political representation affected by big data
   are still considered objective. After presenting research on the
   characteristics of political representation in the information
   technology-dominated public sphere and smart cities, the article
   identifies signs of the decline of contemporary political
   representation: the compression of public space and the legitimation
   processes of datafication facilitated by big data in the smart city. The
   continuation of the article's theme and the analysis of the problems are
   recommended to be pursued in the field of post-political discussions.},

Title = {Beyond Rhetoric: The European Parliament as a Workplace for Parents and
   Current Reform Debates},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Doing justice to their families and the political mandate is especially
   difficult for MEPs. Parents struggle to balance family obligations and
   work, particularly when the children are young. They undertake extensive
   journeys between their home constituencies and Brussels or Strasbourg.
   This taxing routine is further compounded by prolonged working hours,
   often devoid of leisurely weekends. In combination with the absence of a
   comprehensive parental leave policy, these challenges disproportionately
   affect parents of young children, particularly mothers, influencing the
   diversity and representation within the European Parliament. This study
   critically examines the existing conditions that shape the working
   environment of MEPs who are parents. It explores recent endeavors to
   reform these conditions and the underlying obstacles that hinder the
   progress of these reformative initiatives. Referring to relevant
   documents, this study first outlines formal regulations governing
   parental rights in the European Parliament. We then address informal
   rules and recent reform proposals using insight from MEP interviews.
   This examination investigates how parent MEPs assess working conditions
   and balance competing demands. Despite expectations, the European
   Parliament falls short of being as family-friendly as anticipated.
   Nevertheless, recent times have witnessed increased attention to the
   topic and various reform proposals. The obstacles posed by diverse
   national legacies and variant conceptions of MEP mandates and statuses
   for reform are highlighted.},

Abstract = {High expenses are associated with international investment arbitration.
   To save the additional expenditure of the adjudication, parties
   typically prefer sponsored third-party arbitration proceedings. On the
   other hand, the third-party funder is interested in funding the
   arbitration to benefit significantly from the dispute's resolution.
   Interestingly, the arbitrators should be able to overlook the
   Third-Party Funding {[}TPF] issue to gain the necessary competency.
   Their competence is limited to disputes between the foreign investor and
   the host state only. This article discusses the concept and legal status

Title = {Evolution of Brazilian Democracy: Unveiling Election Dynamics in
   Political Issues, Negativity, and Acclaim},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {In recent years, Brazil, as the world's fourth -largest democracy,
   witnessed the dominance of polarized and symbolically charged electoral
   campaigns on social media, culminating in the election of a populist
   political figure in 2018 and his subsequent defeat in 2022. Extensive
   research has indicated that political campaigns often sidelined
   substantive policy proposals in favor of negative and divisive issues.
   However, a critical gap remains in the absence of temporal
   investigations contrasting the prevalence of negativity and acclaim
   campaigns on social media platforms during elections. This study
   addresses this gap by examining associations between political issues
   and negative and acclaim campaigns across two Brazilian electoral
   campaigns. Drawing upon a sample of messages posted on Twitter (n =
   1,191) during the presidential elections of 2018 and 2022, our study
   reveals associations between substantive political issues, such as
   education and health, and acclaim campaign strategies, while the
   divisive issues of Covid-19 and corruption are associated with negative
   campaign strategies. Moreover, the results suggest that gender policy is
   related to both acclaim and negative messages since it is a polarizing
   issue in Brazilian politics. Our study also shows an increased
   negativity trend, with the 2022 presidential election campaign more
   likely to be negative than in 2018. By conducting a temporal analysis of
   Brazil's political context, our study sheds light on the evolving
   dynamics of political communication in the age of social media,
   contributing substantially to the literature on negativity in political
   campaigns.},

Title = {Appointment of Key Officials under Semi-Presidentialism: Case of
   Lithuania},
Journal = {POLITOLOGIJA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {114},
Number = {2},
Pages = {8-54},
Abstract = {Both academics who study presidential powers and political practitioners
   acknowledge that Lithuanian president enjoys the power to appoint
   high-ranking officials. This article investigates the determinants of
   success (or failure) of presidential decrees by which nominations of
   high-ranking public officials are submitted to Seimas. Presented theory
   and results are also discussed in a wider context of literature on
   semi-presidentialism: what does this power say about the role of
   presidents and the functioning of such regimes? Analysis employs an
   original data set, which consists of 337 decrees by presidents of
   Lithuania from 1993 to 2023 that were submitted to Seimas for consent
   regarding the appointment of respective public officials. The
   statistical analysis is complemented by information from semi-structured
   interviews with several high-ranking politicians. The study reveals
   several key points. First, high success rate of decrees (about 92.7
   percent) is explained by the incentives of the constitutional algorithm
   and the informal practice of coordinating nominations between the
   president and the ruling majority before submitting them to Seimas.
   Second, quantitative analysis and qualitative interviews reveal that the
   success of decrees increases with the judicial appointments that are
   advised by a body of experts (Council of Judges) and decreases with
   appointments to heads of institutions. Third, some cases can also be
   explained by personal characteristics of nominees: age (result of
   quantitative analysis) or their self-presentation to Seimas
   (semi-structured interviews). Fourth, cohabitation - when the president
   and the parliamentary majority are of different political camps - only
   partially explains the success of decrees. Some unsuccessful decrees
   occur because of a short-term drop in the ``temperature{''} of
   intra-executive relationship. However, this drop usually bounces back to
   cooperation phase-thus, the power to appoint high-ranking officials
   contradicts popular paradigm of literature on semi-presidentialism,
   namely that sees the relationship between president and government as
   competitive. The president himself together with the system of checks
   and balances around this power almost ideally embody the moderating
   power: important condition is that the moderator himself is also
   constitutionally ``moderated{''}.},

Abstract = {The article attempts to analyze the main trends in the deve-lopment of
   the concept and scientific direction of public policy. Despite the fact
   that for more than a decade and a half this concept and direction have
   been actively introduced into Russian scientific circulation and the
   education system, the discussion about the subject field and practical
   significance of public policy is far from over. Russia is not
   homogeneous in its search for the basic meanings of public policy.
   Within foreign scientific schools there are also various interpretations
   of this concept, which differ from each other not only from theoretical
   and methodological, but also from political and ideological points of
   view.According to the author, in order to understand the versatility and
   prac-tical meaning of public policy, one should take into account the
   socio-poli-tical context in which this direction was born and developed.
   Being originally a product of socio-political and value changes in the
   second half of the 20thcentury, the conceptual framework of public
   policy helped researchers, politi-cians, bureaucrats and citizens take a
   different look at how to build communi-cation between the state and
   society, how to make the decision-making pro-cess more problem-oriented
   and closer to people's real lives. At the same time, the author
   underscores the lack of a single answer to the questions posed by public
   policy, highlighting two main traditions in its understanding. The first
   tradition gives priority to the state and public administration, while
   the second one focuses on the role of civil society. Today Russia is in
   the process of developing its own meanings of public policy that would
   adequately reflect the needs of the state and society and con-tribute to
   building effective communication between them in order to improve the
   quality of decisions. This article should be considered as a
   continuation of the corresponding discussion, which is crucial for the
   Russian scientific com-munity both in theoretical and practical terms.},

Abstract = {The trajectory of radical left parties during the 2010s presents a
   complex facet of contemporary European party politics. The decline of
   traditional social-democratic parties has at times facilitated the rise
   of political formations positioned to their left, addressing issues
   increasingly neglected by the mainstream Left. While scholars have
   extensively explored the radical Left's relation to austerity politics,
   EU institutions, populism, and political strategies, less attention has
   been given to how these parties frame the concept of the nation and
   articulate national belonging. This paper seeks to address this academic
   gap by comparing the three most prominent radical left parties in Europe
   during their peak: SYRIZA in Greece, Podemos in Spain, and La France
   Insoumise in France. Through discourse analysis, this study focuses on
   how these parties employ a form of left-wing patriotism to integrate
   national elements into their discourses. Ultimately, this paper aims to
   shed light on a frequently overlooked aspect of the radical left party
   family through a comparative analysis.},

Abstract = {The corpus of political science problems related to the development,
   security, and sovereignty of the state, which stimulates the increased
   interest of both government structures and representatives of the
   scientific community, also includes a new concept of `food miles.' The
   deconstruction method and comparative analysis applied by the author
   showed that the semantic foundation of the terminological unit under
   consideration is based on the neorealist paradigm of international
   relations. The author seeks not only to highlight the epistemological
   gaps of the concept, but also to convert them into competitive
   advantages, thus contributing to the discourse related to the
   construction of `improved food miles.' In the empirical part of the
   research, the author chose the agricultural policy of the Moscow region
   as an example, in particular, fixing the low food self-sufficiency of
   the region, compensated both by the intra-national commodity movement
   and the import of basic foodstuffs. For the first time, the dependence
   on the intensive import of foreign food products into the subject of the
   Russian Federation was compared with the degree of environmental damage
   identified using mathematical methods. The author concludes that the
   concept of `food miles,' having replenished the categorical and
   conceptual apparatus of political science and the theory of
   international relations, can be used as a mechanism of `green
   protectionism,' activating the protection of national interests and
   stimulating the diversification of domestic agroecological production.
   As a recommendation to state bodies, the author offers a plan of
   amendments to legislative acts, as well as a graphic project of
   ecological labeling of food products.},

Abstract = {This article illustrates how AI uses in counter-terrorism is currently
   dealt with by the emerging global AI governance. It shows that
   counter-terrorism represents a problematic exception in many of the
   legal regulations of AI that are emerging. At the same time, while it is
   somehow addressed in counterterrorism reports and best practices, a
   legal conversation about AI within the global counter-terrorism
   architecture is also problematically lacking. The article ends by
   putting forward an urgent call to international institutions to do more
   to regulate the use of AI in counter-terrorism as this technology may
   imply important risks in terms of human rights abuses by powerful
   actors.},

   conditions in France in the 2010s},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2024},
Number = {147},
Pages = {81-104},
Abstract = {While the ``salting{''} of the Maoists of the `68s has already been the
   subject of sociological studies in the past, this article aims to
   revisit this political practice by questioning the practice in progress,
   based on respondents who have migrated themselves in the working class
   after the 2000s. At a time when revolutionary belief, the socializing
   force of May 68 and working-class centrality are disappearing, the
   article aims to question the coherence of the self in a far-reaching
   social shift for these intellectuals who became ``workers{''}. In this
   case, the social construction of self-coherence involves a significant
   hierarchization of spheres of life and the transfer of their
   dispositions to intellectuality in the displacement. In contrast to
   approaches that emphasize the social ordeal of crossing social
   boundaries, the dispositionalist approach emphasizes the self-coherence
   found in displacement. Indeed, these militants manage to live as
   intellectuals in the working-class world, even if this presupposes
   strong conditions of possibility for maintaining coherence over time. To
   answer this question, we'll be basing our analysis on a certain fringe
   of contemporary ``embedded militants{''} corresponding to the
   best-educated young militants who join the ranks of skilled workers.
   These are the people who most clearly demonstrate this search for
   coherence and cohesion.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to study the mechanisms of resistance
   organised by workers in the paradoxical environment of the recruitment
   consultancy. The consultancy sector is a particularly suggestive field
   of study, since, for years, it has been established as a vector of
   change and a faithful reflection of the transformations and new forms of
   work marked by flexibility and the outsourcing of services. A relevant
   feature of the profound changes taking place in the world of work is
   linked to the resignification of the normative ideal of the ``good
   worker{''} and the normative and referential displacement of the
   traditional employee. The figure of the intra-entrepreneur, an employed
   worker who is required to have an attitude and mentality comparable to
   those of the entrepreneur, reflects the processes of profound
   transformation of the normative reference points of the world of work.
   Through a detailed autoethnographic approach, we develop an empirical
   analysis aimed at identifying some of the strategies of resistance used
   on a daily basis by recruitment consultants, delving into their
   transgressive and reproductive dimension of the existing social order
   within the organisations studied.},

Abstract = {Since the transition to democracy, Panama has been characterized by its
   political and economic stability, which was based on a ``transistist{''}
   consensus. We propose that this economic and political model is a
   Panamanian translation of what academia has called rentism in other
   countries. In 2023, however, it showed signs of a possible cracking of
   this solidity: on the one hand, the pre-electoral year showed strong
   signs of disarticulation of the party system as it was known; on the
   other hand, the most massive social protests of the democratic era took
   place. Indeed, with climate change and mining opportunities, some
   economic elites seem to be looking for alternatives to the historical
   economic model. This generates strong social tensions and could render
   inoperative the existing party system in the country, which existed
   precisely around this consensus on transitism},

Title = {ON THE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE PHENOMENON OF CIVIL WAR IN ANCIENT
   PHILOSOPHY: STASIS AND BELLUM CIVILE 49},
Journal = {POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The concept of civil war remains relatively underdeveloped given a
   steadily increasing interest of political philosophers in the study of
   civil conflicts in general. The multi -layered genealogy of this notion
   includes elements of significantly different approaches to its
   definition. The two divergent lines of interpretation of the phenomenon
   of civil wars can be traced back to the ancient philosophy: the Greek
   stasis and the Roman bellum civile. In recent years, the concept of
   stasis is making a comeback to the academic circles due to its use in
   the works of Nicole Loraux, Giorgio Agamben and a number of other
   authors. At the same time, the dominant approach to analyzing civil wars
   is based primarily on their perception in line with the Roman concept,
   which presupposes a monistic social ontology model and has significant
   limitations when applied to modern conditions. In the article, the
   author analyzes the main features of the perception of the phenomenon of
   civil wars in the ancient Greek and Roman philosophy. Based on the texts
   of Plato and Aristotle, who elaborated the theory of stasis in the most
   systematic way, the author demonstrates that admitting the possibility
   to overcome just the extreme external manifestations of stasis (but not
   to eradicate it altogether) inevitably impacts the evaluation of the
   importance of pluralism in the life of a political community, the
   interpretation of the actions of the defeated party and memory politics.
   Hence, the author analyzes how the perception of a civil conflict as a
   phenomenon inherent in the life of the polis and, in one form or
   another, an ``inevitable evil{''}, can again be relevant in the context
   of the philosophical and political discussions of the 21(st) century.},

Title = {From Villain to Hero: The Role of Disengaged Terrorists in Social
   Reintegration Initiatives},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Convicted terrorists released from prison often experience social
   stigma, exclusion, and difficulties reintegrating into society.
   Authorities have identified the utility of using formerly convicted and
   released terrorists or disengaged terrorists as an intermediary to help
   and support terrorist inmates as they go through social reintegration
   processes. This article explores their role as an intermediary who
   advocates for fair treatment and rights for their fellow ex-inmates,
   assisting families and helping them undergo the reintegration process.
   This research involved interviews with members of three foundations:
   Yayasan Persadani, Hubbul Wathon Indonesia 19, and DeBintal. By
   analysing the narrative of the participants, this study found that
   social reintegration efforts led by disengaged terrorists fostered a
   sense of social belonging and connectedness among ex-inmates. In
   addition, these foundations offer valuable assistance to terrorist
   inmates while ensuring community safety. They serve as a reliable
   support system during times of need and act as a communication bridge
   between them and the government. This framework positions these
   foundations as integral components in addressing concerns about the
   effectiveness of government-led integration initiatives. The approach
   adopted by these foundations has positive effects on preventing the
   re-engagement of released inmates with extremist networks. Despite the
   need to measure the effectiveness of these initiatives comprehensively,
   efforts made by these foundations provide potential for societal
   resilience against terrorism.},

Title = {New Kids on the Democracy Block: Europeanisation of Interest Groups in
   Central and Eastern Europe},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {The 2004 EU enlargement and related Europeanisation processes supported
   the development of stagnated interest group systems in many ways,
   including with respect to the professionalisation of mainly voluntary
   -based organisations in Central and Eastern Europe. In the pre
   -membership period and initial years after joining the EU, national
   interest groups from Central and Eastern Europe chiefly relied on
   EU-level interest groups for important information, knowledge, and
   know-how concerning EU policymaking, whereas 20 years of membership has
   today established them as equal partners and co -decision -makers. The
   article elaborates on the Europeanisation of interest groups in the
   Central and Eastern Europe region from the start of the process of
   accession to the EU, with three case studies in focus: Lithuania,
   Poland, and Slovenia. The main research question is: In which different
   ways has the Europeanisation process influenced interest groups in the
   region? To address it, the article builds on Johansson and Jacobsson's
   (2016) typology of the Europeanisation of interest groups. Six
   exploratory factors were examined in this regard: (a) contacts with EU
   policymakers and institutions, (b) interest in EU policymaking, (c)
   funding received from EU projects and programmes, (d) networking with EU
   umbrella organisations, (e) participation in open consultations, and (f)
   the relationship of the group with members. To study the effects of
   Europeanisation processes in selected countries, web survey data
   gathered from national interest groups as part of the Comparative
   Interest Groups Survey project were used. Our results show that interest
   groups from Central and Eastern Europe have become ``European{''} in a
   range of ways. Regulatory and discursive Europeanisation is most typical
   for Polish interest groups, identity Europeanisation for Lithuanian
   interest groups, and financial and participatory Europeanisation for
   Lithuanian and Polish interest groups, while organisational
   Europeanisation has the strongest effect on interest groups in Slovenia.},

   contracting people who have only been charged but not convicted. The
   consequences are devastating. Serious criminals are amnestied after six

Title = {THE CONCEPT OF HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION IN ANCIENT CHINESE PHILOSOPHY
   AND CONTEMPORARY CHINESE DISCOURSE},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {6},
Pages = {122-139},
Abstract = {This paper, for the first time in Russian science, outlines the
   evolution of ancient Chinese views on humanitarian intervention and
   their potential use in Beijing's modification of the contemporary
   concept of humanitarian intervention and the `responsibility to protect'
   (R2P) initiative. There are good reasons to believe that the concept of
   humanitarian intervention was formulated for the first time in the world
   history of thought in China during the Warring States period
   (5(th)-3(rd) centuries BC). Its functional equivalents were the terms
   zhu (sic) `judgement/punishment' and zheng (sic) `expedition,' used in
   the discussions of the `sage kings of antiquity' (g-zhi sheng wang
   (sic)(sic)(sic)(sic), semi-legendary exemplary cultural heroes and
   dynastic founders) and in the discourse on the `proper {[}use of]
   military force' ( yi-bing (sic)(sic)), an ancient Chinese equivalent of
   the just war theory. The views on humanitarian intervention evolved from
   `divine intervention' (i.e. military actions as the execution of
   heavenly judgment, till the beginning of the 3 rd century BC) to
   `humanitarian intervention' (military actions as a means for rescuing
   the people from the villainous government, by the end of the 3 rd
   century BC). Beijing's use of this tradition might create a greater
   scope for legitimizing political actions that meet the interests and
   values of the PRC, thus raising the legitimacy bar of humanitarian
   intervention, and helping to specify the methods and mechanisms of
   peaceful conflict resolution under the R2P. The main aspects of the
   `sinicization' of modern humanitarian intervention, taking into account
   the ancient Chinese ethics of war, can be an alternative
   conceptualization of the political space, an emphasis on the morality of
   a legitimate actor, a criterion of popular approval, a rethinking of jus
   in bello and jus post bellum as verifiers of jus ad bellum, the
   distinction between a regime change and a ruler change, and a focus on
   intervention as the last resort.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to encourage reflection on the lack of
   physical structure in Brazilian cities, which hinders the mobility of
   visually impaired people in their environments. The greatest obstacle to
   this material barrier is the lack of public policies based on existing
   technical standards and geared towards the use of instruments that
   enable mobility and spatial orientation for these people within cities.
   The method used was based on the use of documentary and bibliographic
   sources and statistical data collected by the Brazilian Institute of
   Geography and Statistics- IBGE. As a result, it can be seen that Brazil
   falls far short, in numbers, of achieving target 11.7 of SDG 11,
   established by the 2030 Agenda, so that the result achieved was
   disappointing, both overall and by region of the country. Brazil did \&
   nacute;t even reach 50\% of the target for equipment implemented in its
   public spaces or environments. Finally, the 2030 Agenda in SDG 11,
   target 11.7, indicates the path to be followed and the measure to be
   adopted to promote a dignified life for all with the support of the
   whole of society via the path of inclusion.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE CIENCIA POLITICA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Guatemala's 2023 was defined by the year's most stunning and tumultuous
   election in all Latin America. After his shocking second-place finish in
   the first round, little-known anti-corruption candidate Bernardo Ar \&
   eacute;valo of the young Movimiento Semilla party won the presidency.
   Following years of increasing democratic decline and a vicious law-fare
   campaign against regime opponents, the 2023 election, which was meant to
   further bolster authoritarianism, became a democratic breakthrough. This
   article takes stock of the 2023 electoral cycle, analyzing the social,
   political, and international factors favo-rable for authoritarian
   consolidation alongside the surprising dynamics of democratic
   resilience. Guatemala's recent anti-democratic slide was spurred not by
   executive ag-grandizement but by prosecutorial and judicial entities on
   a political mission and intent on using legal instruments to criminalize
   dissent. However, through a combination of divisions in the ruling
   coalition, momentum from prior anti-corruption mobilization, and robust
   international backing, actors from below, namely indigenous communities
   and the broad-based opposition movement cultivated by Semilla, saved
   Guatemalan democracy. In so doing, they carved a path toward political
   renewal that few could have imagined a year earlier, though its promises
   remain fragile and uncertain},

   future of Brazil in the decade in the 1950s},
Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {1-20},
Abstract = {The national issue remains one of the main problems in Latin America,
   even after the dominant classes of the ``region,{''} in association with
   the USA and the ``free world,{''} adopted a militaristic solution in the
   decades from the 1960s to the 1980s, through military dictatorships.
   Before this option was implemented in Brazil in 1964, the sociologist
   Guerreiro Ramos tried to persuade the military of the mistake of
   militarizing the national issue. Given the significant presence of
   military personnel in the Bolsonaro government (2018-2022) and the
   proposal of a nation project with a militaristic bias by the supporters
   of this government, this article revisits a reflection that advocates
   the primacy of politics for addressing the national problem in Brazil
   and Latin America. The reconstruction of Ramos's theses and contexts,
   between 1955 and 1961, serves as the argumentative strategy of this
   work. Instead of a militaristic solution to the national issue, this
   sociologist proposed a political solution based on the national
   -popular, which envisioned a Brazilian path to socialism.},

   VIOLENCE IN EUROPEAN FAR-RIGHT: THE CASES OF GREECE AND UNITED KINGDOM},
Journal = {REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE PENSAMIENTO POLITICO},
Year = {2024},
Number = {19},
Abstract = {This article analyzes from an interdisciplinary perspective the
   processes of violent radicalization in which the far-right is immersed,
   combining the critique of political economy, especially due to the
   windows of opportunity generated by the current capitalist crisis, with
   elements from political science and of behavioral sociology. First, the
   article studies the transformation of social norms that legitimize the
   use of political violence in the far-right as a legitimate means (and as
   an end) from a macro, meso and micro perspective, as well as the
   different degrees of violent radicalization. Next, political violence in
   the contemporary far-right is reviewed, focusing on violent protest. The
   third section comparatively analyzes two cases that, although presenting
   differences between them, are characterized by the highest rates of
   far-right political violence in Europe: Greece and the United Kingdom.
   All of this accounts for the transformation of the social bases of the
   hegemonic radical right towards more extreme positions closer to
   classical fascism in terms of ideology, methods and objectives.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {This study addresses the longstanding instability of the Georgian party
   -political scene, which has significantly shaped the nation's electoral
   dynamics. This instability primarily arises from the organization of
   parties centered around the popularity of their leaders. Starting with
   Gamsakhurdia and further strengthened by Shevardnadze and Saakashvili,
   this trend has begun to wane in the last decade. The consequences of
   this unstable system, established in the 1990s, are still evident, with
   Georgian elections often swayed by economic -populist projects led by
   charismatic leaders. Focusing specifically on Javakheti, this research
   examines how the Armenian minority's loyalty to the ruling party can be
   attributed to the party's charismatic leadership and connections with
   elites in Tbilisi. However, election results indicate a declining
   support for the ruling party in this region, reflecting a shift in
   political culture. The study explores the internal structure of voting
   behavior in Javakheti and highlights the influence of ethnic differences
   on political preferences. The conclusions drawn provide insights into
   the social control exercised by patrons, the dynamics of group versus
   individual rational choice, the impact of ethnic homogeneity and
   settlement concentration, the spatial influence on politics, and the
   legal framework governing the political mobilization of the ethnic
   minority.},

Abstract = {The way the field of Geography teaching has been established in Brazil
   demonstrates that we are still walking along a utilitarian logic
   sustained by neoliberal rationality, which deceitfully promises the idea
   of a better future. This corroborates the notion that Geography teaching
   needs to serve a purpose, which supports policies such as the Base
   Nacional Comum Curricular (BNCC) {[}National Common Core Curriculum] and
   the Novo Ensino M \& eacute;dio (NEM) {[}New High School], promising
   students the ability to make decisions about their own destinies,
   shaping the citizens demanded by the contemporary world, but burdening
   them with the possibility of future failure. Thus, through an exercise
   of theoretical speculation, this article proposes to escape
   utilitarianism in Geography teaching by engaging in queer
   experimentation. Understood as an experimental dimension of the world,
   queerness enables the imagination of another world, challenging notions
   of time and space, disentangling from promises of a future that have no
   guarantee of being fulfilled given the Brazilian sociopolitical
   scenario. Therefore, queering Geography teaching is not an answer or a
   project, but an experimental exercise in thinking of this education as a
   producer of meanings, with the experience of living together as a
   constant act of creation.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The selection of methodological approaches in political science research
   has always been surrounded by debate. During the late twentieth century,
   quantitative analyses were argued to be preferable over qualitative
   ones. However, this paradigm was gradually debunked thanks to the work
   done by Brady and Collier (2004) and Goertz and Mahoney (2012). This
   article starts out by trying to uncouple the existing hierarchy between
   methods which political science inherited from a classic vision of
   research in the discipline and proposes some guidelines to face
   methodological decisions while doing research in the field. After
   introducing the different research traditions used by researchers in
   political science, it suggests focusing not only on the research
   questions, but also taking into account the hypotheses in order to
   highlight the importance of congruence between theory and methodology.},

Abstract = {While populism has kept the attention of scholars for years, only a
   handful of elections have presented as clear-cut a distinction between
   populism and anti-populism as the face-off between Andrej Babi \&
   scaron; and Petr Pavel in the 2023 Czech presidential elections. To
   investigate the factors behind the electoral support for the populist
   candidate Babi \& scaron;, we first discuss populist and anti-populist
   approaches and connect them to the emerging literature on the geography
   of discontent. Then, we analyse census data at the municipality level
   using two regression models: the ordinary least squares and spatial
   error methods. The spatial error regression variant is helpful when
   analysing aggregate data as it evaluates the spatial clustering of
   residuals. Overall, we conclude that Babi \& scaron; was most successful
   in regions marked by socio-economic deprivation and social capital
   deficiencies. Consequently, based on the overarching theoretical
   framework and empirical findings, we suggest several implications that
   could help mitigate political discontent in the future.},

Abstract = {E-Governance has become a key research focus on public administration.
   Since 2015, Georgia's civil service reform has aimed at creating
   effective, transparent, and citizen-oriented services. This article
   analyzes its trends and challenges, comparing them to Estonia's best
   practices. Using desk research, document analysis, and indepth
   interviews with Georgian (5) and Estonian (3) public agency
   representatives, as well as local and international experts (9), the
   study identifies key preconditions for Estonia's success and Georgia's
   digital transformation challenges. The findings contribute to
   understanding the factors essential for effective e-governance
   development in post-Soviet contexts.},

Abstract = {Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is currently facing a situation where the
   rule of law (whose promotion and strengthening is one of the European
   Union's main priorities in BiH and the wider Western Balkan region), has
   become an area for the further destabilisation of the country's
   political and security situation by dominant local political actors, as
   the case of Milorad Dodik shows. The reactions of some International
   Community actors (e.g., the High Representative Christian Schmidt), who
   aim to prevent further destabilisation, are subsequently questioned, as
   their (and their decisions') legitimacy is downplayed by local BiH
   actors and significant states (e.g., China and the Russian Federation).
   The aim of this article was thus not only to examine the logic behind
   Dodik's long-term political strategy in BiH, but also to demonstrate his
   capability to subvert the system established by the Dayton Peace
   Agreement (DPA) via standard legislative procedure, for the sake of
   securing his own power position in the country's political environment.
   It also analyses HR Schmidt's use of illiberal means to reach liberal
   outcomes, and his response to Dodik's activities of June and July 2023.
   The unique insights from thirty-nine personalised semi-structured
   interviews, which took place in parts of BiH (Sarajevo, Mostar, Banja
   Luka, and Te \& scaron;anj) in May, June, October and November 2023, and
   January and February 2024, as part of the author's ethnographic
   research, are presented in the article. The interviewed individuals have
   backgrounds in academia, culture, media and local politics. The analysis
   demonstrates that Dodik's actions should be interpreted within the
   broader context of BiH's political landscape, where ethnonationalism is
   intertwined with power distribution and formalised by the provisions
   outlined in the DPA. Although his secessionist rhetoric has intensified
   since 2021, Dodik's political strategy has pragmatic contours, which
   means that global geopolitical developments could play a more
   significant role in deepening the political crisis in BiH. A return to
   greater interventionism from current HR Schmidt is therefore not an
   adequate panacea for the country's ongoing political complexities},

Title = {Urban cultural insurgencies: the fight for the Brazilian city},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Based on the study of 24 urban insurgencies, in seven Brazilian
   metropolises, we discuss their principles, contextualization and
   results. Following a historical review of Brazilian urban practices and
   policies highlighting alternate hopes and deep disenchantments, we
   describe the methodology and present the case study. The conclusions
   are: there are still no signs of the replication of such experiences in
   more extensive practices; they suggest a preference for working detached
   from official governmental structures; they follow global commitments
   and aspirations in virtual and very informal consortiums but rather act
   locally and independently; they are most commonly found on the periphery
   and in abandoned downtown areas; they avoid hierarchical structures,
   advocate for minority causes, propose affirmative actions and rely on
   social media for their organization. In general, their impacts are
   restricted but suggest a pragmatism with feasible emergency solutions.
   The article's tone, also shaped by the authors' personal experiences, is
   quite positive and even suggests a possible urban utopia},

Title = {BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE AND THE AFRICAN CONTINENTAL FREE TRADE AREA},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {1},
Pages = {174-181},
Abstract = {. In 2023, exactly 10 years have passed since the proclamation by
   Chinese President Xi Jinping of the One Belt, One Road Initiative
   (OBOR), which has become the flagship direction of China's foreign
   policy. OBOR is a combination of two mega-projects - the Silk Road
   Economic Belt (SREB) and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road (MSR). A
   special role in promoting cooperation between China and African
   countries is played by the MSR, which passes through the states of East
   Africa - Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Madagascar and South Africa. The
   book ``One Belt One Road Initiative and the Construction of the African
   Continental Free Trade Area{''} is devoted to the development trends of
   cooperation between China and African countries within the BRI, as well
   as assistance from the PRC in the construction of the African
   Continental Free Trade Area. Yang Baorong and Ma Hanzhi form the core of
   the team of authors. The book includes several chapters, the third of
   which is devoted to tying infrastructure under the BRI and helping to
   build the African Continental Free Trade Area, and the fourth is devoted
   to political proposals that deserve special attention. Although some
   conclusions made by the authors are questionable, the book is a major
   achievement, on the one hand because of its a qualitative analysis of
   the formation, development and emerging difficulties of economic
   integration in Africa, and on the other hand, because it reveals the
   position of China and the Chinese scientific community on promoting
   dialogue with the countries of the continent within the BRI and
   promoting free trade between the PRC and African countries. The red
   thread in the work traces the idea of the importance of the One Belt -
   One Road initiative for the successful construction of the African
   Continental Free Trade Area, as well as for the successful
   implementation of the 2063 Agenda.},

Abstract = {Populism has been a much-studied concept in Social Science research. A
   great share of research on the concept has been dedicated to measuring
   the occurrence of populism in political text. In this article, I propose
   a novel measure of populism that considers established theoretical
   assumptions, i.e. presenting the people as morally superior and the
   elite as evil. This moral framing of the antagonistic groups is
   necessary to identify populist discourse while keeping it separate from
   empirically related concepts, e.g. radical right-wing ideology. The
   novel two-step dictionary detects morally-framed references to both
   groups. I apply this approach to a text corpus of all speeches given in
   the European Parliament from 1999 to 2014 and carry out extensive
   validity checks. Taking the moralizing notion of populism more seriously
   not only contributes to our theoretical understanding of populist
   discourse and its impact on the political sphere, but the new measure
   also improves previous approaches to measuring populism.},

Title = {From revolution to democracy: the role of international election
   monitoring in founding elections},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 31},
Abstract = {This study examines why some new democracies invite international
   election monitors while others do not, focusing on the context of
   democratisation. It posits that not all democratisation episodes are
   qualitatively similar, and these differences influence the likelihood of
   inviting election monitors. The study hypothesises that new governments
   emerging from democratic revolutions are more likely to invite
   international monitors for their founding elections. This likelihood
   arises because post-revolutionary regimes face greater uncertainty about
   their democratic nature than elite-led transitions do. By comparison,
   regimes that democratise through elite pacts face less pressure to prove
   their democratic credentials, making them less likely to invite
   monitors. Quantitative and case study analyses are used to test the
   hypothesis, providing a new perspective on variations in election
   monitoring invitations between the Cold War and post-Cold War periods.},

Abstract = {In the complex landscape of multiparty electoral systems, accurately
   capturing shifts in voter preferences poses significant challenges.
   Traditional polling methods, which rely heavily on basic vote intention
   metrics, often fail to predict substantial changes in voter support. A
   notable example is the recent resurgence of the Parti Qu \& eacute;b \&
   eacute;cois (PQ) in Quebec, which reached levels of support unseen since
   1988. This resurgence, alongside other unexpected electoral outcomes,
   underscores the limitations of conventional forecasting methods. By
   examining the Quebec political scene post-2022 election, this research
   note assesses the effectiveness of the Relative Confidence Index (RCI),
   an innovative yet underutilized metric, in quantifying parties'
   potential for growth. Findings suggest that the RCI could have provided
   early insight into the PQ's unexpected resurgence. More broadly, the
   study argues that the RCI addresses a critical gap in traditional vote
   choice measurement by offering detailed insights into voter likelihoods
   and party preferences, thereby fulfilling the need for more accurate and
   informative measures in multiparty systems.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the dynamics of violence against women and girls
   (VAWG) by bandits in northwest Nigeria through qualitative and
   quantitative research methodology. The study notes women and girls are
   disproportionately targeted for various reasons: diminishing presence of
   the state in maintaining order, and the propensity of the bandits to
   punish or exploit the communities through the instrument of coercion.
   The paper concludes that efforts to eliminate, neutralize and disrupt
   (END) VAWG in the context of banditry in northwest Nigeria must embrace
   four strategies the peacebuilding approach, security-sector reform,
   development, social support and strategic health care delivery to

Abstract = {Political parties offer gateways to power for democratic leaders, but
   they also condition leaders' activities. A ``presidentialized{''} party
   organization enhances the operative capacity of leaders, including
   presidents that have been overlooked in European political science
   literature. Theoretically, two factors are expected to increase the
   ``presidentiality{''} of parties: a president-centered regime type and
   party's leader-centric ``genetic{''} heritage. This study presents the
   first systematic effort to analyze causes of party presidentialization
   quantitatively in various national contexts and party types. Alongside
   full presidential systems, the study pays attention to semi-presidential
   systems that are most popular in European countries today and which
   present mixed incentives for parties by forcing them to facilitate
   several leader positions at the executive level simultaneously. To
   assess these relationships empirically, the study utilizes Political
   Party Database Project's (PPDB) global dataset. We develop a
   conceptually robust and comparable measure for party presidentialization
   and apply it to 96 parties in 25 semi-presidential and presidential
   democracies. We explore the impacts of regime and party types and find
   considerable support for the former and more limited support for the
   latter. Our results suggest that parties' organizational makeup can
   condition presidential activism.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the theological foundations in Grotius' works, On
   the Satisfaction of Christ against Faustus Socinus and The Rights of War
   and Peace, highlighting the links between the atonement of Christ and
   other forms of human sacrifice. It suggests that the distinct changes
   regarding human sacrifice observed in Grotius' argument across his works
   can largely be attributed to the political development of the Dutch
   theological controversies. In The Rights of War and Peace, Grotius takes
   a `secular turn', creating a distinction between human and divine
   punishment while also differentiating between divine and human sacrifice
   of the innocent. Grotius' revision of his position on human sacrifice
   resulted in two significant legacies in international law. Firstly, he
   shifted towards a universally applicable denunciation of the sacrifice
   of the innocent, thereby enhancing his critique of `barbarous'
   practices. Secondly, he accentuated the distinctive status of
   individuals in international law through the prohibition of punishment
   transfer. The paper ultimately reveals how Grotius' engagement with
   theological controversies considerably influenced his international
   political thought, and in turn, how theology played a crucial role in
   the formation of modern international law.},

Abstract = {Social media has transformed political communication by making it easy
   to post and free to disseminate information. Interest groups can use
   social media platforms to direct messages to policymakers and to educate
   the public about their issues. By providing a platform that can be used
   by groups regardless of their size or resources, social media expands
   opportunities for lobbying activities and provides policymakers and the
   public with information on the interests of a wider and more
   representative range of groups. To what degree do interest group
   organizations take advantage of this and what does that advocacy look
   like? We investigate these questions using an original dataset of nearly
   13 million Twitter and Facebook posts from interest groups active in
   national policymaking in the US. We find that in many ways patterns of
   lobbying on social media are consistent with how interest groups act in
   other settings, but that groups seems to view social media as primarily
   a medium for public education on their issues.},

Abstract = {Since the turn of the century, the emergence of new (types of) parties
   and the organizational evolution of established ones has challenged
   traditional ideas of party membership with innovative forms of
   membership and affiliation. These shifts affect how parties build
   linkage and sustain their communities. While many studies focus on the
   changing nature of membership within individual parties, a
   comprehensive, comparative understanding of these changes - what is
   driving them, and how they impact the democratic functioning of
   political parties - is lacking. We establish a theoretical and empirical
   framework to investigate these phenomena that distinguishes between the
   concept of party membership (what it is supposed to achieve) and the way
   in which party membership is operationalized from the perspective of the
   state, parties as organizations and individuals. Our framework and
   illustrative examples serve as a foundation for the comprehensive
   empirical analysis undertaken by the contributors to this special issue.},

Abstract = {Over the past decades, increasing dissatisfaction with political parties
   and the rise of far-right populism have undermined the ability of party
   organizations to fulfill their traditional roles. In this context, new
   parties have emerged, offering alternatives for voters disillusioned
   with mainstream parties. This paper proposes a generational approach to
   examine whether the supporters of new parties exhibit distinct patterns
   of engagement and varying perceptions of democratic institutions. In
   order to explore incentives for engagement and compare the political
   attitudes of members from new and established parties, this paper relies
   on original data from the first national survey with party members in
   Brazil. Using multivariate analysis and experimental data, we first
   evaluate the appeal of enhancing intraparty democracy as a means of
   fostering party engagement in both old and new parties. Additionally, we
   assess whether members of new parties hold different attitudes toward
   key features of party politics compared to their counterparts in
   established parties. Our findings suggest that members of
   first-generation parties in Brazil demonstrate greater resistance to
   anti-democratic values. Furthermore, new members across all generations
   demonstrate greater skepticism regarding political institutions. These
   findings highlight the challenges facing contemporary democracies at
   both the organizational and individual levels.},

Title = {Gendered EUropean careers? Representation and the challenges in women's
   political careers},
Journal = {EUROPEAN UNION POLITICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {3-22},

Abstract = {The European political arena, particularly the European Parliament, is
   considered a more favourable environment than the national political
   spheres for women. However, nearly half a century passed before a woman
   was appointed president of the European Commission. Women remain
   underrepresented in both the European Parliament and the Council.
   Against this backdrop, this special issue offers a comprehensive
   analysis of women's political careers in the European Union addressing
   barriers to gender equality and examining their influence on political
   representation. By bringing together distinguished scholars and new
   insights from two previously rather separate research areas-political
   careers in the European Union and gender representation studies-this
   issue sheds new light on the challenges women face. This introduction
   presents a multidimensional framework addressing who, what, when and how
   regarding key challenges women face as political leaders in the EU, such
   as legislated gender quotas, gendered norms, and societal stereotypes.
   The articles in this special issue reveal that women in European Union
   politics face challenges from individual and collective actors, with
   party gatekeeping and institutional structures playing critical roles.
   Gendered stereotypes and the multilevel nature of European Union
   politics significantly impact women's career trajectories, highlighting
   the need for reforms at both the European Union and national levels.},

Title = {Labour market risks and preferences for EU unemployment insurance: the
   effect of automation, globalization and migration concerns},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 2},
Abstract = {Societies are experiencing deep and intertwined structural changes that
   may unsettle perceptions Europeancitizens have of their economic and
   employment security. In turn, such perceptions likely alter
   people'spolitical positions. For instance, those worried by labour
   market competition may prefer greater socialprotection to compensate for
   the accrued risk, or prefer more closed economies where external
   bordersprovide protection (or perceived protection). We develop
   expectations about how such distinct reactionscan emerge from distinct
   labour-market risks of globalization, or automation, or migration. We
   test theseexpectations using a conjoint experiment in 13 European
   countries on European-level social policy. Resultsbroadly corroborate
   our expectations on how different concerns about sources of labour
   marketcompetition yield support for different features of European-level
   social policy.},

Abstract = {This paper aims at unraveling the particular conception of historical
   time derived from different metaphors and arguments developed by Theodor
   Adorno and Max Horkheimer in Dialectic of the Enlightenment . By so
   doing, this paper strives to account from this work potentiality so as
   to bring light into the problems and tendencies underlying our regimen
   of historicity. Through our interpretation of their reading of the
   passage of the sirens, this paper will frame Adorno and Horkheimer's
   diagnostic of modern historical time as bringing with it a separation
   between the present and the past that tend to make the latter fade
   within the configuration of historical time. Going beyond Theodor Adorno
   and Max Horkheimer's historical framework it will be delved further into
   the specificities of the so-called ``presentist regimen of
   historicity{''} so as to evaluate to what extent ideas stemming from
   Dialectic of the Enlightenment provide conceptual tools so as to inquiry
   into the weaknesses of remembering the past today.},

Abstract = {Bayesian brain theory, a computational approach based on predictive
   processing (PP) principles, proposes a mechanistic formulation of belief
   generation and updating. This theory assumes that the brain encodes a
   generative model of its environment, consisting of probabilistic beliefs
   organized into networks, from which it generates predictions about
   future sensory inputs. As the brain interacts with the environment,
   prediction errors representing the difference between predictions and
   sensory signals would be used to update predictions, contributing to the
   remodeling of belief networks. In this article, we provide an
   introduction to the fundamental principles of computational neuroscience
   of belief, and we show how this dynamic of prediction and updating could
   be at the origin of belief generation.},

Title = {Correcting misperceptions about ethno-racial discrimination: The limits
   of evidence-based awareness raising to promote support for
   equal-treatment policies},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 29},
Abstract = {The disadvantages experienced by minorities and lack of societal
   remedies are partly attributable to native-majority citizens' limited
   awareness of minority hardships. We investigate whether informing
   citizens about field-experimental audits on ethno-racial discrimination
   increases their recognition of the issue and support for equal-treatment
   policies. Extending a largely US-centric research frontier, we focus on
   beliefs about discrimination faced by Muslims in Denmark. To further
   comprehension, we test three types of framing: a scientist stressing
   credibility, a lawyer emphasizing the legal breach, or a minority
   expressing grief. Our survey experiment (n = 4,800) shows that citizens
   are generally aware of discrimination and tend to overperceive its
   extent. Communicating audit evidence corrects misperceptions but does
   not change recognition or policy support, regardless of framing or
   initial misperception. Only combining priming, correction, and framing
   temporarily increases recognition and donations to support groups. These
   findings suggest that audit-based awareness campaigns have limited
   immediate success beyond donations acknowledging minority hardships.},

Title = {Elites, the aid curse, and Chinese development finance: A conjoint

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Why do elites in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) favor some
   foreign aid projects and partners over others? Research on the ``aid
   curse{''} and Chinese development finance suggests elites should prefer
   aid that can be easily captured, with few conditionalities, regulations,
   or transparency requirements. We administer a conjoint survey experiment
   across 141 LMICs to elicit the aid preferences of elites who are
   uniquely close to development policy debates. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we
   find that elites favor larger over smaller projects, grants over loans,
   and transportation infrastructure projects over initiatives focused on
   civil society or tax collection capacity. But contrary to the aid curse
   theory, elites also prefer projects with transparent terms and labor,
   corruption, and environmental regulations, and are at worst indifferent
   towards good governance conditionalities. These preferences hold even in
   corrupt and autocratic countries and even among high-level government
   officials who might be expected to favor ``no-strings-attached{''} aid
   regimes.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the qualities of governments that influence their
   perceived trustworthiness, presenting the first experimental study of
   the distinct roles of `competence', `benevolence' and `integrity' (CBI)
   in shaping trust in government. We empirically test the effects of these
   three dimensions of trustworthiness through conjoint experiments
   conducted in five countries: Britain, Croatia, Spain, Argentina and
   France. The results indicate that benevolence - government acting in
   citizens' interests - is the most significant determinant of trust
   judgements across individuals and nations. Competence and integrity have
   a secondary, approximately equal effect. Building on recent advances in
   analyses of conjoint experiments, we explore how these attributes are
   conditional on each other, and how respondent characteristics moderate
   those effects. The findings reveal that the effects of attributes are
   generally consistent, although respondent left-right ideology moderates
   the impact of government competence.},

Abstract = {This paper advocates for an integrated approach to exploring and
   analysing contemporary conflicts, especially in complex socio-political
   and cultural contexts. It examines how a framework that incorporates
   cognitive, socio-political and historical factors can enhance our
   understanding of these conflicts. Grounded in the `cognitive turn', an
   idea that advocates combining cognitive and social sciences insights to
   understand human experiences and actions, this paper draws on secondary
   sources to demonstrate how neglecting emotion-laden factors and local
   contextual realities has undermined conflict analysis. Using as case
   studies the US intervention in Afghanistan and the French missions in
   the Sahel region it argues that emotional blind spots led them to
   overlook critical local factors while focusing narrowly on the rational
   aspects of the conflicts. The paper promotes the development and
   adoption of cross-disciplinary theoretical models that integrate
   cognitive influences, environmental conditions and politico-historical
   contexts to improve conflict analysis and intervention outcomes.},

Abstract = {Regimes do not change consistently across territorial levels. There has
   been progress in understanding national democratic erosions and
   subnational regimes, but barring a few exceptions, these research
   strands have not engaged in a thorough dialogue. To bridge this gap, I
   contend that when democracy advances in one territorial level, but
   erodes in another, we observe multilevel regime decoupling (MRD). Using
   global data from the Varieties of Democracy project, I examine the
   1990-2022 period, showing that the proportion of decoupled cases
   increased from 20\% in the 1990s, to 43\% in the fi rst decade of the
   twenty-first century. Preliminary regression analyses and a descriptive
   exploration of Italy, South Africa, India, and the United States
   indicate the non-deterministic influence of structural factors and the
   potentially pivotal role of courts in facilitating decoupled change.
   Considering these fi ndings, renewed data collection efforts and an
   actor-centred approach are needed to strengthen our understanding of the
   varieties of (de) coupled regime change that have become common over the
   last decade. Given that regimes across territorial levels increasingly
   move in separate directions, future assessments of autocratization and
   democratic change need to embed territorial considerations in their
   analysis to remain informative about citizens' real-world experiences on
   the ground.},

Abstract = {How do cities fight democratic backsliding on the national level? Set in
   an increasingly illiberal context, the four Visegr \& aacute;d capitals
   (V4 capitals) Bratislava, Budapest, Prague and Warsaw have elected
   progressive mayors that challenge national democratic backsliding
   locally. The conceptual framework presented in this article underlies
   the role of city democracy and city diplomacy in understanding cities'
   role in democratisation and autocratisation processes. As part of their
   resistance against democratic backsliding, the four cities intensified
   their attempts to enhance local democracy and to set best practice
   examples. At the same time, they have also shown a strong determination
   to address democratic backsliding collectively. Their proactive response
   includes the establishment of a regional transnational advocacy network
   (TAN) known as the Pact of Free Cities, and the further engagement with
   pro-democracy external actors, including other cities, the European
   Union, and international organisations.},

Abstract = {Environmental protests have been a major strand of contention in Russia,
   yet the cross-regional variation in ecoprotests has not been
   systematically studied. In this paper, combining several protest event
   datasets we analyze the patterns of environmental activism across time
   and regions. The data cover more than 1000 protest events with an
   environmental agenda in the period 2007-2021. Based on these data, we
   develop a typology of Russian regions with the intensity and consistency
   of environmental mobilization as key dimensions. In the next step, we
   explore the covariates of ecoprotests in Russian regions and show that
   the overall level of mobilization, inequality, and governors' tenure and
   links to the coercive apparatus are consistent predictors of
   ecoactivism. We also document the interaction between inequality and the
   strength of governor-siloviki ties indicating that in regions with high
   inequality, the negative effect of the latter is more pronounced. This
   paper contributes to the studies of environmental and subnational
   politics in Russia and demonstrates the need to account for spatial
   heterogeneity even against the backdrop of the consolidated auto- cratic
   regime.},

Abstract = {Does ideology influence voter preferences for foreign aid in the same
   way it does for domestic redistribution? Economically vulnerable
   left-leaning citizens, who are normatively strong proponents of
   government aid, may not be as committed to increasing actual spending.
   Such citizens may see themselves as competing with the foreign poor for
   domestic resources. Similarly, while affluent right-leaning citizens may
   oppose increasing foreign aid due to skepticism about government
   spending, this might not extend to private donations. Instead, they may
   view non-governmental organizations and charities as alternatives that
   leverage private expertise to assist poor countries. Using four years of
   public opinion data from 15 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
   Development donor countries, I find support for the conditional effect
   of ideology and economic self-interest on both public and private aid
   attitudes. By focusing on three different measures-the morality of aid,
   public aid spending, and private donations-I further explore variations
   in aid attitudes.},

Title = {(Cautiously) Embracing pro-Palestinian activism in Singapore: civil
   society in illiberal regimes},

Abstract = {This paper explores the rise of pro-Palestine activism in Singapore. In
   illiberal regimes like the city-state, the political opportunities for
   activists to assert themselves are limited, though not non-existent. It
   is thus instructive to witness how the new surge of pro-Palestine
   activism in the country, and indeed, worldwide, has been dealt with by
   the government. I make the following claims. First, while the overall
   thrusts of Singapore's foreign and domestic policies remain the same
   with regard to the Israel-Palestine conflict, especially on Singapore's
   special relationship with Israel, the People's Action Party (PAP)
   government has given clear concessions to the pro-Palestinian camp.
   Second, this balancing act is done with domestic electoral and political
   goals in mind. The issue has special resonance among younger
   Singaporeans and the Muslim community, and the government is well-aware
   of that. Politically, if not dealt with properly, the matter could also
   be a potential racial-religious fault-line, which is why political
   sophistication was needed to appease the various sides in society. The
   implication is that even in less democratic polities like Singapore,
   activists can make significant gains in the realm of both public opinion
   and policy. This study is situated within the literature on civil
   society-state relations.},

Abstract = {What drives the varied performance of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
   projects? Can the central state's role and the participating nations'
   development needs fully account for the success or failure of individual
   BRI projects? This article challenges the dominant state-centric
   perspective, suggesting it falls short in elucidating the heterogeneous
   results of BRI projects. Through a comparative analysis of the Pan-Beibu
   Gulf Economic Cooperation Zone (PBGECZ) and the New International
   Land-Sea Trade Corridor (ILSTC), the study reveals the impact of local
   government collaboration on the efficacy of China's foreign policy. By
   proposing collective local liberalism, we argue that cooperative
   dynamics, rather than competitive, are crucial for the success of the
   BRI. This nuanced approach underscores the necessity of a collaborative
   framework among subnational actors to enhance the execution and outcomes
   of BRI projects, offering a more comprehensive understanding of Chinese
   foreign policy.},

Abstract = {Republicans in Congress have, by almost any measure, become
   significantly more conservative over the last 25 years. We propose that
   the changing pressures they face when seeking reelection helps explain
   this trend. Rather than moderating towards the general election median
   voter as they had previously done, Republican senators became more
   conservative when seeking reelection to avoid the emergence of, or
   mitigate the threat from, a primary opponent after the Tea Party
   emerged. We also show that at the height of the Tea Party era-the 111th
   to 113th congresses-retiring senators moderated their voting behavior,
   suggesting that their personal preferences were more moderate than their
   expressed preferences. During the Trump era, we report mixed results,
   suggesting that the threat posed by primary challengers was not solely
   ideological, though the new dynamics and behaviors that emerged in the
   Tea Party era have continued to shape the Republican Party in the
   Senate.},

Abstract = {Students enrolled in introductory general education courses in Political
   Science are often uninterested in and unfamiliar with the subject matter
   and do not see its relevance to their lives. Hoping to overcome these
   obstacles, I implemented service-learning into my introductory
   Comparative Politics course. In order to do this, I partnered with local
   nonprofits and government agencies working on topics relevant to the
   course content. Students then selected one of these partners to work
   with throughout the semester. The goal was for them to not only see how
   the course subject matter might apply in their own lives but
   specifically how the global issues we learn about in our course apply in
   our local area. Students were surveyed at the beginning and end of the
   semester and wrote multiple reflection papers regarding their
   experiences. They generally reported high levels of satisfaction with
   the service-learning approach as well as understanding of the importance
   of civic and community engagement.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the effectiveness of bluffing about external
   intervention in shaping civil war dynamics using an agent-based model.
   It argues that warring parties' initial information levels about
   interveners and their learning processes determine the success of
   bluffing. The model explores three scenarios: 1) accurate initial
   expectations and informative signals 2) inaccurate initial information
   and uninformative signals and 3) heterogeneous information sets and
   varied signal updates. Findings suggest bluffing is most effective when
   both sides start with inaccurate expectations and update slowly. The
   model's implications are analyzed through cases in El Salvador, the
   Warsaw Uprising and South Vietnam negotiations.},

Abstract = {Every four years, numerous election-forecasting models attempt to
   predict the results of the US presidential election. Regardless of the
   stability of any election system, such as the bipartisan system in the
   United States, conditions can arise (e.g., candidate resignations) that
   negatively impact forecasters' ability to predict electoral outcomes.
   Citizen forecasting-that is, directly asking respondents who they think
   will win an election-has a long track record of successfully predicting
   presidential elections. This study proposes adapting a citizen
   forecasting measure originally intended for use in multiparty systems to
   predict the US presidential election in 2024. Using this measure, we
   created a forecast of the national-level popular vote and vote-share
   forecasts for seven swing states.},

Abstract = {In most real-life binary voting situations, multiple challenger
   alternatives can potentially contest the status quo alternative, but
   only one of them can be listed on the ballot. Consequently, Condorcet
   cycles cannot be detected by analyzing voting data alone, even when they
   exist. This paper considers a standard theoretical framework where
   Condorcet cycles cannot exist, but demonstrates that this need not be
   the case when voters experience status quo bias. Necessary and
   sufficient conditions for the existence of Condorcet cycles are
   provided. Monte Carlo simulations predict the probability that Condorcet
   cycles exist in binary voting situations with status quo bias to roughly
   one percent under different assumptions and scenarios.},

Title = {Citizen liabilities for state-perpetrated injustices in non-democracies:
   toward a new authorisation account},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 9},
Abstract = {When states perpetrate injustices, do their individual citizens develop
   liabilities to repair such wrongdoings? Most existing accounts of
   citizens' liabilities for state-perpetrated injustices, whilst
   applicable across certain democratic contexts, struggle to provide
   robust accounts of the grounds and nature of liabilities for citizens in
   non-democratic contexts. This problematically leaves a lacuna when it
   comes to the responsibilities and appropriate responses of citizens in
   these states. This article advances a distinctive two-pronged
   authorisation-based account applicable to non-democracies. Objective
   authorisers are individuals who derive presumptive benefits, are
   comparably better-off under, and can reliably influence the
   decision-making processes over the injustice perpetrated by the state.
   Subjective authorisers are citizens who autonomously endorse their state
   as credible interpreters and upholders of their aims in relation to the
   injustices in question. Both objective and subjective authorisers of the
   state in relation to particular injustices perpetrated, are liable to
   compensate, actively oppose, and commemorate the victims of
   state-perpetrated injustices. This account will be shown to be
   empirically applicable to a large number of minimally decent
   non-democratic states, where the political elite enjoy moderate popular
   support over their incorporation and reflection of citizen interests and
   preferences in their governance, despite the absence of formal
   democratic electoral mechanisms. This authorisation-based view differs
   from existing accounts oriented around complicity and participatory
   intentions, in better accounting for non-participants who are
   nevertheless intuitively liable for the actions of their authorised
   state, as well as circumventing structural shortcomings affecting
   complicity-centric accounts.},

Abstract = {State governments are increasingly challenging the national government
   and pursuing state rules in opposition to national laws. I am interested
   in whether the public supports this strategy. Do people want state
   governments to deliver policy outcomes that better fit the interests of
   state constituents-even if it undercuts the authority of the national
   government? Or are citizens critical of state actions that challenge
   national laws? I find that most Americans do not believe that states
   should be allowed to block the enforcement of federal laws they disagree
   with. Opposition to state challenges increases with support for the rule
   of law. Using experiments, I explore whether people are less likely to
   support policy outcomes when they are described as challenging national
   provisions. I find limited evidence that people evaluate state policies
   differently when described as contrary to national laws. People support
   national supremacy in the abstract and accept state resistance to
   national mandates in practice.},

Abstract = {John Mearsheimer and Sebastian Rosato's How States Think is an
   engagingly written book that tackles big questions central to
   International Relations: what does it mean to be rational, and how
   prevalent is rationality in international politics? However, the book
   mischaracterizes how political psychologists think about rationality in
   international politics, mistaking revisions of specific modeling
   assumptions for rejections of rationality more generally. As a result,
   many of the book's critiques are unpersuasive, and its attempts to root
   rationality in a specific understanding of ``credible theories{''} run
   into conceptual challenges. Moreover, Mearsheimer and Rosato's tendency
   to stake out bold claims rather than measured ones - the same punchiness
   that also makes the book so provocative - also leads it to exceed its
   evidentiary limits, resulting in inferences that it is incapable of
   substantiating.},

Abstract = {Gun control policy is formed by regulations that impose direct
   restrictions on various forms of gun possession. A weapon, in the sense
   of real law, represents a thing on which a certain person has the right
   of ownership, which gives its bearer conceptually unlimited private
   legal authority over that thing. The restrictions that the legal order
   imposes on the owner of the weapon, in the exercise of his ownership
   rights, must be proportionate to the nature of the need for the
   restriction in each individual case. The paper will highlight the basic
   forms of control over the possession and disposal of weapons in
   different legal systems and their justification for political and social
   reasons. The paper will analyze the civil law aspect of limiting the
   ownership rights of gun owners by the legislative, administrative and
   judicial authorities in the Republic of Croatia.},

Abstract = {How might the ideas and practices of Global South migrants and activists
   inform normative frameworks and conceptual repertoires that political
   theorists and activists bring to bear on questions regarding justice and
   migration? Taking seriously the call for conceptual innovation to move
   beyond Eurocentrism this article builds on oral histories collected from
   refugees and migrants from the Tribal Areas of Pakistan to argue that
   the concept of haqq raises important questions about the reliance on
   statist justice in contemporary theorizing about migration ethics and
   provides insights into alternative ethical concerns. Ideas and practices
   of haqq foreground social relationships as well as the imbrication of
   responsibility and entitlement for communities and individuals.
   Crucially, engagement with haqq helps dislodge assumptions regarding
   state-enforced rights as universal vehicles of justice. Consequently,
   different ethical questions and imaginaries become available for
   consideration that resonate much beyond debates about migration.},

Abstract = {This analysis uses plausibly exogenous changes in electoral boundaries
   to investigate how voting participation is affected by local
   concentrations of voters who favor majority or minority parties. Novel
   instrumental variable and difference-in-differences models suggest that
   - even while accounting for overall electoral competitiveness -
   participation rates increase where there exist greater concentrations of
   voters who support majority parties, but a similar effect is not evident
   for less- popular, minority parties. Furthermore, this effect is driven
   by spending patterns of the dominant party in the local district.},

Abstract = {Within the domain of public affairs and political science (PAPS),
   student dropout emerges as a critical concern. This study delves into
   the factors influencing the decisions of undergraduate and graduate PAPS
   students to discontinue their programs. Employing a comprehensive
   mixed-methods approach, we surveyed 384 at-risk undergraduates and
   conducted in-depth interviews with 18 former graduate students. Thematic
   analysis of these interviews revealed six pivotal factors influencing
   graduate student dropout: the financial burden of study (including
   tuition and limited financial aid), program curricular challenges (such
   as demanding thesis requirements and inadequate practical components),
   the delicate balance of multiple responsibilities (work, study, and
   family), health-related issues (including anxiety and stress), poor
   academic performance, and personal difficulties (such as lack of family
   support). At the undergraduate level, descriptive analyses indicated
   that 38\% of PAPS students contemplated dropping out, with 30\%
   considering changing their major. Exploratory Factor Analysis and
   Multiple Regression highlighted the significance of factors such as
   family and societal influences, economic considerations, program and
   curriculum structure, institutional dynamics, academic performance,
   personal attitudes, and student health in shaping these contemplations.
   This research not only expands the application of integration and
   engagement theory and the pull, push, and failing out theory but also
   validates their effectiveness in predicting dropout within PAPS
   programs. The study offers valuable insights for both researchers and
   policymakers, underscoring the imperative for more supportive, flexible,
   and financially viable educational structures to enhance student
   retention in the realm of public affairs and political science.},

Abstract = {Social and economic justice organizations (SEJOs) often provide the sole
   form of political representation for marginalized communities in the
   United States. Despite broad representational claims, however, they are
   less likely to advocate on behalf of intersectionally disadvantaged
   constituents. We argue that SEJOs pursue intersectional advocacy at
   higher rates under conditions of descriptive representation by their
   leaders. We test this claim using an original dataset of bureaucratic
   lobbying efforts by a set of such groups between 2004 and 2014. We find
   that organizations led by Black women, Indigenous women, and women of
   color (BIWOC) and white women promote intersectional advocacy at
   significantly higher rates than those led by men of any race or
   ethnicity, but that organizational mission, rather than leadership,
   predicts the influence of intersectional advocacy. We conclude that
   while descriptively representative leadership can rectify biases in
   advocacy agendas, structural conditions moderate intersectional policy
   influence.},

Title = {Rural but not radical right: The rural-urban cleavage in Norway},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 19},
Abstract = {Conventional wisdom claims that rural voters are politically mobilized
   by right-wing and culturally conservative forces, while urban voters are
   left-leaning and have progressive cultural views. Leveraging original
   survey data from Norway, our work challenges this dichotomy. We build on
   cleavage theory and recent research on place identitiesto develop a
   latent measure of rural attachment. Using regression analysis, we
   investigate how well this measure maps onto five different cultural
   attitudes, left- right ideology, and partisan voting. The findings show
   that people with rural identities are not more right-wing, reluctant
   towards immigration, or anti-environmental than their urban
   counterparts. Instead, the geographic cleavage relates to
   dissatisfaction with the way the central government treats rural areas,
   resistance to the EU, and voting for the agrarian Center Party. The
   findings from Norway therefore show that it is possible to mobilize
   rural identifiers without disparaging immigrants or adopting other
   radical-right stances. Our work suggests that the supply of political
   parties plays a decisive role in how rural identities are activated and
   contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the urban-rural divide in
   advanced, multi-party democracies.},

Abstract = {Although influential models of public opinion hold that group sentiments
   play an important role in shaping political beliefs, they often assume
   that group attitudes stem from socialization and are thus exogenous to
   politics. We challenge this assumption, arguing that group attitudes may
   themselves be the consequence of political views. Across three survey
   experiments that each uses a unique social group-issue pair, we
   consistently demonstrate that attitudes toward groups are influenced by
   information about the groups' policy views. These findings persist even
   when accounting for potential partisan signaling. Altogether, these
   results show that group sentiments should not be regarded as wholly
   exogenous to policy concerns and suggest that the use of group-based
   heuristics can be consistent with instrumental models of public opinion.},

Title = {Divided we abstain: Testing the effect of local income inequality on
   individual-level turnout using Norwegian administrative panel data},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {92},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between income inequality and
   voting by utilizing exceptionally granular data that offer novel
   insights into local disparities. Existing research documents a larger
   turnout gap between rich and poor in areas characterized by high income
   inequality, causing concerns about further underrepresentation for
   low-income individuals and a larger democratic deficit. While previous
   studies have focused on inequality at higher aggregation levels, this
   paper advances the field by employing administrative data with complete
   income and validated voting records measuring inequality for
   neighborhoods hosting 1212 residents on average. The longitudinal setup
   allows rigorous modeling following the same individual in the same
   context over time. The results suggest that living in a neighborhood
   where the income difference between rich and poor becomes more
   pronounced discourages participation in national elections among
   low-income voters while it boosts participation among the rich, further
   accentuating the class-based inequality in political voice.},

Abstract = {This study explores how and why some individuals are resilient to
   radicalisation by focusing on individuals who were labelled
   ``terrorists{''} for their alleged involvement or support for an
   attempted coup that took place in Turkey on 15 July 2016, yet who have
   shown no sign of violent radicalisation since. Drawing from 15
   interviews, it assesses both the potential radicalisation risk factors
   that the participants display, such as political persecution,
   imprisonment, torture, social pressure and forced migration. Then, it
   explores participants' explanation for why they have not become
   radicalised, including the role of the Hizmet doctrine, their religious
   adherence, individual personality traits and resources (e.g. social
   capital) through a socioecological framework. While terrorism studies
   have focused extensively on pathways towards radicalisation and
   countering radicalisation, this study contributes to a small body of
   research to explore the notion of ``non-radicalisation{''}, informing
   the literature on resilience and protective factors towards larger
   populations.},

Title = {Fiscal legibility and state development: Theory and evidence from
   colonial Mexico},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 7},
Abstract = {We examine how fiscal legibility, the ability of central authorities to
   observe local conditions for the purposes of taxation, shapes political
   centralization and state development. When rulers lack information about
   the periphery, they may benefit from ceding autonomy to tax-collecting
   intermediaries to encourage fiscal performance. As information quality
   improves, rulers become better able to monitor and sanction local
   officials, allowing them to tighten control over taxation and establish
   more direct state presence. Centralization, in turn, encourages
   investment in improving fiscal legibility, leading to long-term
   divergence in state development. We study the consequences of a
   technological innovation that dramatically improved the Spanish Crown's
   fiscal legibility in colonial Mexico: the discovery of the patio process
   to refine silver. We show that political centralization differentially
   accelerated in affected districts and that these areas subsequently saw
   disproportionate state investment in informational capacity, altering
   the trajectory of state development.},

Title = {Social Capital and Information Flow in Decision Making: A Social Network
   Analysis of Actors in a Road Expansion Project in Kristiansand, Norway},

Abstract = {Information sharing is crucial for decision-makers to enhance their
   capacity and influence in local decision-making. However, the mechanisms
   of information flow among different actors in local decision-making for
   urban transport are not well understood. This paper utilises social
   capital theory and social network analysis to investigate how actors
   control and share information based on their position in the decision
   network. The position of individuals in the network is critical to
   understanding how they receive and share information, as well as their
   influence on the decision-making process. Data were collected from
   documents and interviews with 28 participants in the decision-making
   process for a road expansion project in Kristiansand Municipality,
   Norway. These data formed the basis for conducting a social network
   analysis (SNA) of two networks, focusing on meeting and information
   sharing among participants. The results reveal centralised networks
   around four main actors with the highest centralities-two planners and
   two politicians. The social connections and resources among those
   involved in the project expose imbalances and internal dynamics not
   solely attributed to the structure of the decision-making process. The
   findings have implications for local decision-making. Understanding the
   centralities of actors allows decision-makers to identify key
   influencers and opinion leaders. It is also helpful for comprehending
   communication and collaboration barriers among decision-makers and
   developing strategies to overcome these barriers.},

Abstract = {The peculiarity of the Holocaust in Transcarpathia, also known as
   Subcarpathian Rus', is that the process of segregation and extermination
   of most of the local Jewish population lasted only about seven months.
   Most Jews were not deported until 1944, and the region was liberated
   months earlier than in more western parts of Central Europe. Jewish
   survivors returned to this quasi-state territory amidst the process of
   its Soviet annexation, which put local Ukrainians at the top of the
   power hierarchy. This abrupt change in interethnic relations as a result
   of the genocide has not yet been studied. I therefore focus on the
   entangled interactions and post-war social history of Holocaust
   survivors. In this article, I explore the complex process of the
   restitution of real estate and personal property in rural and urban
   areas, focusing not only on the interim authorities at different
   administrative levels who coordinated the restitution and integration of
   survivors but mainly on Jewish survivors and their diverse agency. I
   argue that the social position of Jews in the immediate post-war period
   differed depending on the location. Anti-Jewish resentment among
   Ukrainians in villages manifested itself at the official level as the
   confiscation of Jewish property. At the same time, the Soviet
   authoritarian centralization of power ensured that destructive processes
   and conflicts in rural areas did not escalate into open confrontation
   and violence. Instead, in the urban space, the agency of the first
   survivors who returned to the cities contributed to successful
   restitution cases. Nevertheless, this was possible primarily through the
   close interaction and cooperation of the Jews with local authorities at
   the highest levels.},

Abstract = {Icelandic presidential elections are under-studied in the field of
   political science. We examine the determinants of vote choice in the
   2024 Icelandic presidential election and, in particular, whether the
   election can be characterised as a second-order election, where voters'
   views about parliamentary politics are more important than their views
   on the presidency. We rely on data from four surveys focusing on various
   aspects of the 2024 election to investigate which factors were the most
   important drivers of vote choice, whether voters voted strategically
   against the candidate most associated with the incumbent government, and
   whether the election results might have been different under alternative
   voting systems. Our findings suggest that attitudes towards the national
   government were the strongest determinants of vote choice in the
   election and that strategic voting appears to have played an important
   role in shaping the outcome. However, views about the role of the
   president also played a role and the eventual winner, Halla T \&
   oacute;masd \& oacute;ttir, would likely have won under any of the
   voting systems considered. We conclude with a discussion of how our
   results affect interpretations of the Icelandic presidency and the
   presidential mandate.},

Title = {How the radical right reshapes public opinion: the Sweden Democrats'

Abstract = {This study enhances our understanding of the long-term impact of radical
   right parties (RRPs) on public opinion by examining the local
   mobilisation of the Sweden Democrats (SD) over the past two decades.
   Drawing on extensive local-level data from Sweden's 290 municipalities
   (2002-2020), merged with survey data, the study reveals that the gradual
   establishment of RRPs in local politics alters voters' policy
   preferences, increasing the salience of immigration. The study further
   shows that the SD's local presence reshapes societal divides, leading
   individuals to increasingly sort their ideological views according to
   their positions on immigration, while reducing the prominence of
   economic redistribution issues. Consequently, public attention shifts
   away from traditional economic-redistributive conflicts towards
   immigration-related concerns. These findings have significant
   implications, suggesting that the local establishment of RRPs
   reconfigures public perceptions of political conflict from the
   grassroots level, independent of demographic trends, external crises,

Abstract = {Autocratic ruling elites allow elections as a survival strategy. Many
   authoritarian regimes have taken this tactic one step further, also
   inviting their diaspora to vote from afar. This may seem puzzling given
   that elections abroad are difficult to control and provide a platform
   for exiled regime critics. So far, however, the reasons for autocracies
   to grant their diaspora voting rights have rarely been explored. In this
   article, we address this shortcoming. We employ a cross-national,
   autocratic regime dataset and a discrete-time event history model. We
   argue that autocracies use diaspora suffrage to repress and co-opt their
   citizens abroad while legitimizing their rule domestically and
   internationally. Autocrats are risk-averse and the decision to
   enfranchise hinges on the characteristics of the diaspora and the
   regime's need for legitimacy, repression and co-optation after power
   transitions. We substantiate these claims by demonstrating that
   autocrats are less likely to enfranchise a diaspora that largely resides
   in democracies or consists of refugees in democracies. In turn,
   successful coups render diaspora suffrage adoption more probable. In
   sum, external voting rights present a critical case to better understand
   why authoritarian states adopt democratic institutions and wish to
   connect with their internationally mobile population.},

Title = {Revisiting liberal intergovernmentalism in CFSP: preference formation
   and the EEAS},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {439-460},
Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {Liberal intergovernmentalism (LI) posits that member states' preferences
   are domestically shaped and align with the positions of the largest
   states. However, during EEAS negotiations, major states had divergent
   views on Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) integration, risking
   nonagreement. Despite the inability to counter external threats
   effectively, states prioritised sovereignty and national interests. This
   paper, based on interviews with member states and EU institution
   representatives involved in the bargaining process, evaluates LI's
   applicability to CFSP integration. It examines the preference formation
   of France, Germany, and Spain during the creation (2002-2003) and design
   (2010) of the EEAS, the last revolution in the institutional framework
   of the CFSP and the most innovative body established by the Treaty of
   Lisbon (2009). The study contributes theoretically and empirically to
   understanding LI. Since member states follow an exogenous but not
   liberal preference formation process, it concludes that LI should be
   revised.},

Abstract = {Voters, like consumers, experience choice overload when presented with
   too many similar options. The literature on consumer behavior finds
   overwhelmed consumers often opt out of making a decision altogether.
   Yet, how large candidate fields affect American voter behavior remains
   unexplored. I use an aggregate-level analysis leveraging exogenous
   changes to Louisiana's electoral institutions and an individual-level
   analysis to investigate the effect of varying quantities of choice on
   ballot rolloff in U.S. House elections. Ballot rolloff is the phenomenon
   where voters turn out to vote, yet abstain in a given election. I find
   that an electoral institution that incentivizes candidate entry causes
   5.7-7.1 percent more ballot rolloff, and also that individuals are more
   likely to rolloff when there are more candidates running in their House
   election. Louisiana is simply the best case to explore a phenomenon that
   is likely occurring in party primaries throughout the U.S.-choice
   overload at the ballot box.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long believed that the influence of radical right parties
   in the European Parliament was indirect due to their internal
   heterogeneity, limited involvement in parliamentary activities, and the
   existence of a cordon sanitaire. However, the consolidation of these
   parties, marked by the Identity and Democracy group becoming the fourth
   largest group in 2019, raises concerns about their impact on European
   Union decision-making. This article seeks to understand the extent and
   conditions under which the radical right group in the European
   Parliament can influence policymaking. By analysing roll-call votes from
   the 9th term (2019 to 2024), we introduce a measure of voting influence,
   operationalised as the ability of a party group to sway the outcome of a
   vote in plenary. Our analysis reveals that while the radical right group
   frequently joins winning majorities in the European Parliament, its
   voting influence remains limited because of the low levels of conflict
   in plenary.},

Abstract = {This article aims to reconstruct the `silent' reformulation of the
   notion of disability within social policy systems in recent decades.
   Particular attention is given to the practices implemented in the United
   Kingdom as an example of a conditional welfare state with advanced
   workfare arrangements (primarily in the form of the Employment and
   Support Allowance scheme). The redefinition of disability from the
   perspective of changes in the criteria determining social benefits -
   that is, in reality, limiting the social rights of this, as one British
   economist put it, `silent minority' - is framed as part of a broader
   trend termed `antisocial social policy' and is captured through the lens
   of welfare scarcity, a component of welfare sociology. This proposed
   framing, based on a Marx-inspired critical analysis, fills the gaps in
   the concept of welfare state retrenchment which excessively focuses on
   conservative right-wing politics.},

Abstract = {Previous works have correctly highlighted the strategic and tactical
   convergences between the Bennite New Left and the Corbyn insurgency.
   However, such scholarship has underestimated the impact of the
   differences in the composition between the two intra-party movements.
   Critically, while the Benn project developed as an attempt to update
   Labour strategy in times of social upheaval, Momentum and the Corbyn
   movement emerged as a hybrid alliance between New Left veterans and the
   extra-parliamentary anti-austerity and libertarian left. This impacted
   the Left's conceptualisation of socialist strategy and led to
   disagreements over tactics. This paper will explain how, despite these
   differences, the 2010s Left ended up reproducing the core tenets of New
   Left's strategy and tactics. This outcome is explained as a consequence
   of a convergent conceptualisation of social change and the persistence
   of intra-party conflicts.},

Abstract = {Immigration has been shown to drive ethnocentrism and anti-globalization
   attitudes in native-born populations. Yet understanding how global
   integration shapes intercultural relations also necessitates clear
   evidence on how migration affects the attitudes of migrants. We argue
   that migration can foster tolerance, cosmopolitan identities, and
   support for international cooperation among migrants who experience
   sustained contact with other cultural groups. We evaluate this theory
   with the first randomized controlled trial resulting in overseas
   migration, which connected individuals in India with job opportunities
   in the Persian Gulf region's hospitality sector. Two years after the
   program began, individuals in the treatment group were significantly
   more accepting of ethnic, cultural, and national out-groups. Migration
   also bolstered support for international cooperation and cultivated
   cosmopolitan identities. Qualitative and quantitative evidence links
   these changes to intercultural contact overseas. By focusing on migrants
   rather than native-born individuals, our study illustrates how
   cross-border mobility can facilitate rather than undermine global
   integration.},

Abstract = {One recent debate in political theory centers on the question of whether
   there is a distinctively political normativity. According to an
   influential view, there is a distinctive set of norms that applies
   specifically to political actions and decisions, which are not grounded
   in moral normativity. On one version of this non-moral view, political
   theory is grounded in epistemic normativity (and thus epistemic norms).
   Theorists identifying as ``radical realists{''} insist that political
   theorists do not need any moral normativity (and thus moral norms),
   because epistemic normativity may provide action-guidance for political
   theory. In this article, we take our point of departure in a critical
   analysis of this epistemic version of the non-moral view, with the
   overall aim of analyzing the importance and limitation of epistemic
   norms in political theory. We argue that epistemic norms are
   necessary-since a political theory should not rely on empirical
   falsities-but not sufficient for a successful account in the political
   domain. Two claims are made: moral norms are essential in the process of
   political theorizing, both in the form of pre-epistemic norms and in the
   form of post-epistemic norms. More specifically, we contend, first, that
   we need moral norms to identify and justify which practices to study
   when conducting political theorizing, and second, that we need moral
   norms to tell us how to act in light of our investigation of warranted
   and unwarranted beliefs.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},

Abstract = {Berber question is a substantial component of an enduring identity
   crisis, in which Algerian authorities had been found entrapped since the
   very beginning of independence. This article examines the extent to
   which the escalation of this identity crisis may be explained either in
   colonial legacy terms, or as a result of Algerian authorities'
   mismanagement of an exclusively identity-oriented claims widely
   recognized as legitimate. Although, the exploration of different stages
   - through which identity claims agenda had been set - made the point of
   controversial patterns; however, mismanagement pattern prevails as a
   sustaining factor of an ongoing crisis. Today, despite the
   constitutional recognition of the Berber dimension as an integral part
   of Algerian identity (via the constitutional amendment of 2016), dealing
   solely with the Berber heritage in its folkloric dimension, is what some
   militant forces within the Berber movement fear and other matters that
   have yet to be adequately resolved (e.g. the use of Tamazight as the
   language of instruction). This article surveys the developing situation
   of the Berber question and aims for a better understanding that will
   hopefully help determine the future of the Berber question in Algeria.},

Abstract = {In this paper we explore how a Citizens' Assembly project in Auroville -
   the largest intentional community in the world - sought to prefigure new
   practices in collective decision-making. A Citizens' Assembly model is a
   democratic innovation that enacts a deliberative mode of political
   decision-making by everyday citizens. It has been used by diverse
   bodies, from social movements to nation-state governments around the
   world. Auroville's 2021 Citizens' Assembly pilot - concerning a water
   vision for Auroville - is a unique case study that enables us to make a
   distinctive contribution to the existing academic scholarship concerning
   Citizens' Assemblies and prefigurative politics on two grounds. Firstly,
   Auroville is an intentional community shaped by specific spiritual and
   self-governance values - an uncommon setting for a Citizens' Assembly
   that supports us to make specific empirical offerings not seen in the
   literature on Citizens' Assemblies to date. Secondly, given that
   Auroville's pilot Citizens' Assembly sought to prefigure the community's
   foundational ideals of ``human unity{''} and ``unending education{''} in
   its collective decision-making practice, we connect our analysis to the
   academic scholarship concerning prefigurative politics. In doing so, we
   uniquely draw together the scholarship concerning Citizens' Assemblies
   and the literature concerning prefigurative politics to explore whether
   such democratic innovations have a transformative effect on the
   political contexts they are embedded in, which we freshly consider with
   a focus on local scale, and the role that institutionalisation might
   have in terms of ensuring the reproduction, and thereby lasting impact
   of such experiments, or conversely their nullification.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Volume = {64},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Many voters support the inclusion of technocrats in government. Yet we
   know very little about why technocrats are considered more appealing
   than traditional party representatives. In particular, it is unclear
   which advantages and disadvantages voters attach to the defining traits
   of technocratic ministers: party independence and expertise. We engage
   with this question drawing on a pre-registered survey experiment in
   Austria. We examine how manipulating ministers' party affiliation and
   expertise affects voters' perceptions of their issue competence and
   bargaining competence. Findings indicate that voters ascribe lower
   levels of issue competence to partisan ministers than to non-partisan
   ministers, notwithstanding their actual expertise, and that ministers'
   partisanship shrinks the positive effect of expertise on perceived issue
   competence. However, this `partisanship penalty' disappears for
   supporters of the minister's party. Moreover, voters perceive
   partisanship as an advantageous trait with regard to a minister's
   bargaining competence. While voters like technocrats for their expertise
   and independence from party politics, our findings reveal nuanced
   perceptions, with voters still recognizing distinct advantages in being
   represented by party politicians.},

Abstract = {The growing availability of data from social media sites has allowed for
   in-depth studies on online political behavior. In particular, estimating
   whether belief in far-right conspiracy theories leads to better or worse
   electoral outcomes for the Republican parties has produced conflicting
   results. Borrowing from the literature on complex contagion, we turn to
   data extracted from Twitter to study the correlation between the network
   of contacts of Republican users and electoral outcomes in the November
   2022 U.S. Senate elections. We find that the clustering coefficient of
   Republican supporters is significantly and positively associated with
   higher levels of support for GOP candidates in these races. However, the
   impact of embeddedness in social networks varies depending on whether
   candidates in these races were explicitly endorsed by former President
   Donald Trump.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we explore the roots of perceptions of local corruption
   in U.S. cities, using survey data collected from 39 cities during 40
   different mayoral election campaigns. We examine the impact of the
   city-level corruption context alongside measures of political
   information, partisan and racial/ethnic representation in local
   government, evaluations of personal and policy satisfaction, and other
   individual-level attitudinal and demographic characteristics. We find
   that perceptions of local corruption are responsive to the local
   corruption context-though this relationship is heavily conditioned by
   political knowledge-satisfaction with local conditions, other
   attitudinal measures, and, to a lesser extent, co-ethnic representation
   in local government.},

Abstract = {Costa Rica is a democratic exemplar, having maintained a critical mass
   of female legislators over two decades and approached gender parity in
   political offices; thus, it is a useful context for examining theories
   of change for gender representation. We use process-tracing to track the
   evolution of descriptive representation and examine when and how
   critical actors affect the legislative process in Costa Rica. We
   evaluate the extent to which critical mass representation has advanced
   substantive gender representation-the adoption of legislation favorable
   to women's interests-through case studies of the 2020 law on street
   sexual harassment, and the 2022 law on violence against women in
   politics. We find that greater descriptive representation provides a
   pivot point for substantive representation, although critical actors in
   the form of key legislators and women's organizations provide the
   necessary agency for legislative successes. The case study contributes
   to both theories and methods for understanding how descriptive
   representation and substantive representation interact in the democratic
   legislative process.},

Abstract = {Who is blamed when factories close or when there are mass layoffs?
   Whether it be the closing of an auto plant or the threatened off-shoring
   of the Carrier furnace factory, media reports frequently incorporate
   justifications-or frames-that provide context about the closure or
   layoffs. We conduct an analysis of media coverage of factory layoffs in
   the United States and Canada, and find that the most common frames often
   include foreign competition and trade policy, changing market
   conditions, or exogenous shocks, such as the pandemic. We argue that
   such frames alter who the public holds responsible and thus affects the
   public's preferred policy responses. We test the effect of media frames
   on the public's blame attribution and subsequent policy preferences
   using a survey experiment about General Motors factory closings. The
   results from a sample of almost 6,000 respondents in the US and Canada
   show that the public is quick to shift blame to the government, reducing
   blame to the company, and shifting attention to particular government
   responses. We find that the most common media frames significantly shift
   support for trade policy in both countries, but have no effect on
   domestic public assistance programs such as unemployment benefits or
   retraining and education programs. Notably, most treatment effects are
   similar across ideological types. The results hold practical
   implications in terms of the incentives of politicians to promote
   specific explanations of factory closings and theoretical implications
   in terms of moderating the highly partisan expectations within the
   current literature on economic blame attribution.},

Abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies become ubiquitous, research
   on their implications for democratization has blossomed. Will AI empower
   citizens and strengthen democracy or fuel the rise of autocracy? This
   special issue brings together diverse theoretical, conceptual, and
   empirical contributions to offer a synoptic perspective on this question
   across political contexts. In this introduction, we argue that the most
   significant socio-technical novelty pertaining to AI - the possibility
   for automated hyper-personalization - catalyses four structural changes
   that capture the complex relationship between AI, democratization, and
   autocratization. First, technology corporations have emerged as a new
   quasi-governing class that holds political power without democratic
   legitimacy. Second, automated hyper-personalization has transformed the
   citizen-state relationship by fostering hyper-technocracy and
   paternalism in democracies, and enhancing regimes' repertoires for
   controlling citizens in autocracies. Third, AI is changing the
   environment in which citizens exercise their political rights,
   exacerbating political polarization, societal fragmentation, and apathy.
   Finally, at the international level, AI has created new arenas for
   competition between democratic and authoritarian states, engendering a
   struggle for both technological capabilities and the values and norms
   that will govern them. The articles in this special issue explore these
   dynamics from micro impacts to structural changes in state behaviour and
   international relations.},

Abstract = {Since its founding, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has maintained
   its original aspiration of eliminating poverty, improving people's
   living standards, and steadily achieving the common prosperity of the
   whole Chinese people. The Party has consistently led the Chinese people
   in fighting against poverty throughout all the stages of China's
   revolution, construction, reform and development, eventually winning a
   comprehensive victory in this fight. In the Party's work, poverty
   alleviation has always been one of the main tasks, and has included
   efforts both to help the poor acquire knowledge and to build their
   aspirations for change. Specifically, rural areas have been the key area
   of activity, and the Party's fundamental approach to combating poverty
   has always centered on development, employing an all-encompassing
   campaign that involves state, social and market forces. It should also
   be noted that the elimination of absolute poverty is not the end of the
   fight. The CPC will continue struggling tirelessly to create a better
   life for the people and to realize common prosperity, thus opening up a
   new phase in the fight against poverty in general.},

   Military Police},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {The article reflects on the debate of the demilitarisation of the
   Military Police (MPs) in Brazil, based on the National Public Security
   Plans (PNSP) that were launched after the 1988 Constitution of the
   Federative Republic of Brazil (CFRB/1988) and the plan currently in
   progress, in view of the problems involving the MPs in the field of
   Public Security. To this end, we applied a bibliographical and
   documental qualitative research with specifically focus on the reserved
   space in each Plan on MPs. So, was analyzed the presence, or not, of
   guidelines that indicate the possibility of demilitarising theirs.
   Finally, we realize that such a debate oscillates between a certain
   shyness and even negligence because it is surrounded by a conservative
   vision even in wings considered more progressive, which reveals
   demilitarisation as a taboo topic in the face of the political and
   institutional centers of power that make MPs a mechanism for maintaining
   the status quo of an ambiguous democratic rule of law in Brazil.},

Abstract = {From an ideational perspective, this article studies the landing and
   consolidation of the idea of ``Chile as a model country{''}, and
   subsequently analyzes its permeation in the Chilean political elite and
   society from 2006 to 2019. It concludes that four points cemented the
   mentioned paradigm: the neoliberal economic model, the technocratic
   logic, consensus and sociopolitical stability. The four presidencies
   between 2006 and 2019 continued to reproduce this idea, with greater or
   lesser intensity. However, its permeation in society gradually
   decreased. By the time of the social outbreak, the paradigm of ``Chile
   as a model country{''} had strongly permeated the political class, while
   the citizenry was going through a crisis of representation.},

Abstract = {By analysing judicial decisions and the academic literature, this
   article argues that supreme and constitutional courts of several
   countries have highlighted three types of corruption concerning on-books
   campaigns and party contributions: quid pro quo corruption, dependence
   corruption; and the corruption of the electoral competition. The paper
   shows that the typology can help improve the understanding of a crucial
   challenge for constitutional democracies: at what point a campaign or
   party contribution (i.e., a right granted by legislation) and gifts
   given to politicians (i.e., in certain contexts, something tolerated by
   law) becomes a bribe. The article explains how a significant part of
   public opinion encourages broadening the concept of bribery and its
   standard of proof, encompassing reciprocal relationships with the
   appearance of reciprocity that previously fell short of bribery and its
   proof. The Brazilian Supreme Court's poor use of the typology in the ADI
   4650 decision (regarding the constitutionality of campaign finance
   regulation) influenced the adoption of a broad concept of bribery in
   Operation Car Wash cases. Due to the connection with political rights,
   the typology can contribute to fostering citizens' confidence in the
   legitimacy of pillar institutions of the Brazilian constitutional
   democracy.},

Abstract = {The European Union's response to Russia's war of aggression has run
   contrary to expectations of EU foreign policy inaction and incoherence
   as well as warnings of de-Europeanization and renationalization of
   foreign policy. Drawing on the concept of coordinative Europeanization,
   we argue that the response to the war has allowed for a more horizontal,
   cooperative decision-making process involving both member states and EU
   institutions, as well as a reversal of traditionally Western
   European-centric dynamics of horizontal Europeanization. With the aim of
   investigating these changes further, this paper relies on the 2022
   Russian invasion of Ukraine as a case study to explore how crises shape
   Europeanization dynamics in EU foreign and security policy. Relying on
   primary and secondary sources as well as interviews with EU and national
   officials, we show how the coordinative Europeanization we have
   witnessed since the start of the war can be attributed to the
   characteristics of the crisis itself. In so doing, the paper contributes
   to the literature on Europeanization of foreign policy as well as to
   studies focusing on the effect of crises on the process of European
   integration.},

Abstract = {Does learning political candidates' social categories through visual
   cues affect voter preferences? This paper explores this question by
   conducting a visual conjoint survey experiment with 2324 German voters,
   varying whether respondents received information on candidates through
   explicit labels or pretested AI-generated candidate pictures. The
   results confirm our expectations that the way in which social categories
   are perceived affects preferences, with visual cues having a more
   significant effect on voter preferences compared to textual cues,
   leading to more discriminatory preferences for certain social
   categories. Moreover, we show that the effect of visual cues is
   moderated by the visibility of social categories, with visible social
   categories, such as gender binaries and ethnic in-/out-group, eliciting
   more discriminatory preferences with visual cues. The study sheds light
   on how visible and invisible social categories affect political
   candidates' preferences and emphasizes the importance of considering the
   intersectionality of social categories and their relationship with
   ideology.},

Abstract = {The American electorate is increasingly affectively polarized. Partisans
   dislike members of the opposing party, even going so far as to
   discriminate against opposing partisans in nonpolitical domains. Given
   the potentially pernicious consequences of affective polarization,
   especially in nonpolitical settings, scholars have suggested
   facilitating contact between members of opposing parties as a means of
   reducing affective polarization. We test this approach in the context of
   a large introductory American government class comprised almost entirely
   of Democrats. Our pre-registered experiment randomly assigned recitation
   sections to treatment or control conditions, where the treatment was an
   hour-long discussion with a county chair from the Republican Party, and
   the control was an hour-long discussion with an attorney with no party
   connection. Partisan attitudes and evaluations were measured extensively
   at baseline, within a few days of the intervention, and two months
   later. We find no evidence that the treatment changed students' partisan
   evaluations. We conclude by considering theoretical avenues for future
   experiments that change the nature and extent of cross-party social
   interaction.},

Abstract = {One of the issues raised by Ben Clift's book on the OBR is the paradox
   in UK neo-liberal thinking since Brexit. This is created by the attempt
   to reconcile their support for a transnational, technocratic,
   depoliticised rules-based order with the exercise of national
   sovereignty to take back control. In this contribution to the symposium
   I will explore some of the ways these tensions appear in recent
   Conservative thinking. These tensions relate to unhappiness about the
   established institutions of economic governance. These have grown in
   recent years and particularly since Brexit, culminating in the Truss
   Government's attempt to sideline the OBR, the Treasury, and the Bank of
   England in formulating its economic policy.},

Abstract = {The literature on women's participation in genocide and related violence
   focuses on the actions of women who are either at the very top or at the
   very bottom of social hierarchies. Exceptional roles played by a select
   few elite women prosecuted at international criminal tribunals have been
   recognized. Scholars have also examined the motivations of ordinary
   women who are swayed by ethnocentric scapegoating or commit violence out
   of fear and coercion, including social and economic incentives. In-depth
   analyses of female perpetrators in the professionals category who, along
   with men in that category, serve as bridgemakers between commoners and
   leaders are scarce. With the exception of nurses, teachers, and
   secretaries involved in the Holocaust, the professionals category is
   gravely understudied in scholarship on perpetrators. This article begins
   to rectify this gap by examining the case of Val \& eacute;rie Bemeriki
   who, as a journalist for the Radio T \& eacute;l \& eacute;vision Libre
   des Mille Collines (RTLM), promoted the genocide against the Tutsi in
   Rwanda. Val \& eacute;rie is a perpetrator who was intimately close to
   many Rwandans, including her victims, through the radio, yet she is
   simultaneously unfamiliar as her motivations have not been widely
   disclosed. The article provides an interpretive analysis of my interview
   with Val \& eacute;rie, radio transcripts of Val \& eacute;rie's hate
   speech obtained by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
   (ICTR), and Rwandan and international newspapers and secondary source
   materials concerning Val \& eacute;rie. The findings suggest that
   perpetrators in the professionals category convey a contradictory
   experience in their motivations during the violence and their grievances
   in the aftermath. While Val \& eacute;rie minimized her agency in the
   genocidal machine, emphasizing structural constraints, she actively
   distinguished herself from powerless commoners, including Rwandan women
   living in a deeply patriarchal society. The article portrays Val \&
   eacute;rie as a strategic professional who hoped to excel by catering to
   powerful political figures.},

Abstract = {The United Kingdom's asylum system for assessing and managing the
   processing of claims for international protection is widely perceived as
   fundamentally broken. For some its dysfunction lies in the numbers
   claiming asylum and the absence of control over their entry. For others
   the problems center on the danger that asylum seekers endure to reach
   the United Kingdom and the protracted and dehumanising nature of the
   process they endure. All can agree that the system is costing far too
   much at present due to the need to accommodate the very considerable
   number of asylum seekers awaiting a decision. The linked issues of delay
   and cost have now been substantially addressed. But there are new
   problems looming. These all revolve around dealing with the pathway to
   either integration or departure. Delays in the appeal system, lack of
   focus on voluntary and involuntary departures, misuse of detention
   spaces and improving the integration of refugees all need urgent
   attention.},

Title = {The ideological profile of the technocratic citizen},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},
Pages = {626-648},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A certain type of citizen holds technocratic views. They favour
   pragmatic problem solving through scientific and technical expertise,
   and reject party politics for being harmful to the common good. Yet,
   empirical evidence on the ideological profile of these citizens is
   fragmented and inconclusive. Using an original survey in Western Europe,
   Australia and the United States, we test predictions about the
   left-right alignment of citizens with technocratic attitudes on the
   economic and cultural dimensions of politics. We argue that technocracy
   is not antithetical to ideology and that citizens holding technocratic
   attitudes are not immune to ideological positions. Findings show that
   technocratic citizens are more economically left-wing than mainstream
   voters, contrary to common associations of technocracy with neoliberal
   economic principles. However, they are more centrist than populists.
   This highlights that, in addition to a representational challenge,
   technocracy mounts an ideological challenge to party-based
   representative democracy. In times of cumulative crises, which put
   democracies under stress with demands for competence and effectiveness,
   these findings offer insights about the appeal of alternative forms of
   representation.},

Abstract = {Human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer
   (LGBTIQ+) persons have been and continue to be highly contested in
   different contexts all across the world. Their realization is an
   on-going struggle beyond the national scope. This article's main
   interest is to unpack how the rights of LGBTIQ+ persons are negotiated
   and fought for in different governance arenas. Towards this end, I
   examine activist strategies concerning rights of LGBTIQ+ persons in
   southern Africa. The analysis zooms in on the strategies of
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on the national (Botswana) and
   regional (Southern African Development Community, SADC) level. The
   analysis is structured along the concept of contextualization. As an
   advocacy strategy in a highly contested field, contextualization is
   employed by national and transnational NGOs on two levels. They
   contextualize their strategies within a multilevel governance system;
   and they contextualize their activism practices to foster the human
   rights of LGBTIQ+ persons on these governance levels. With this
   approach, we can explain why some entities, such as the African Union,
   are targeted as agents of change for the human rights of LGBTIQ+
   persons, whereas some are not even perceived as relevant platforms to
   engage, such as the SADC.},

Abstract = {Since 2008, the European Union (EU) has been engulfed in several crises.
   While distinct, these crises are feeding into each other and are testing
   the capacity and resilience of EU and member states, bringing forward
   common policy questions and new forms of cooperation. The permanent
   character of this state of crisis has made analysts talk about our times
   as the age of permacrisis. As a result, a trend towards a new mode of
   `coordinative Europeanization' in EU decision-making has been observed
   since the Covid-19 crisis. In this paper we first define the new mode of
   coordinative Europeanization and outline its key features. We argue that
   the recent crises have altered the EU member states' relationship in
   pursuit of fast policy responses. We analyse the reasons behind this
   changing relationship as well as the possible avenues it may take. We
   then discuss the challenges caused by coordinative Europeanization and
   how it relates to pre-existing de-Europeanization tendencies. We close
   the paper with an analysis of the significance of our findings and we
   propose new avenues for research.},

Abstract = {Do private interests predict politicians' rhetoric? Focusing on housing
   policy, we compare issue emphasis and positions of landlord politicians
   and politicians who do not own multiple properties. Ireland provides a
   unique opportunity to study legislating landlords' behavior as housing
   has become one of the most important political issues. We construct a
   novel dataset of politicians' homeownership status between 2013 and
   2022, a period characterized by rising rent and property prices. We
   fine-tune a transformer-based machine learning model and apply text
   scaling and sentiment analysis to identify issue salience and positions
   on housing in over 870,000 tweets and parliamentary questions. Contrary
   to our expectations, landlord politicians do not avoid the topic of
   housing, nor do they take different positions. We also find that
   government status does not influence this relationship. The results
   imply that private financial interests do not influence rhetoric on
   housing policy.},

Abstract = {This study uses an online survey to conduct a list experiment to
   determine whether the military conflict between Hamas and Israel
   (mid-May 2021) - the so-called Operation Guardian of the Walls - should
   be considered political use of force by Prime Minister Netanyahu to
   preserve his threatened political career and life. Our study analyzed
   the experimental data and contributed to the studies on the political
   use of force from the perspective of political psychology. The result
   revealed that citizens with perceptions of political use of force rated
   Netanyahu's war leadership more highly than citizens without such
   perceptions.},

Title = {More Electoral Competition Without More Voter Participation:
   Quasi-Experimental Test of a Term Limit Reform in Ecuador},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1042-1054},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Term limits are theoretically expected to boost voter participation
   which has been confirmed by multiple empirical examinations. This study
   uses a robust causal assessment within the difference-in-differences
   framework to evaluate this hypothesis. It leverages an exogenous 2018
   term limit reform in Ecuador which prohibited some, but not all,
   incumbent mayors from running in elections. Contrary to expectations,
   the results indicate null findings: the adoption of term limits has
   neither increased turnout, nor depressed the casting of blank and
   spoiled ballots (alternative indicators of voter engagement under
   compulsory voting). This is puzzling given that the reform impacted the
   electoral competition by significantly increasing the number of mayoral
   candidates in the newly open-seat contests. Two possible solutions to
   the puzzle of the null findings are presented with implications for
   understanding the scope conditions for the effect of term limits on
   voter participation.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyze Turkiye's humanitarian diplomacy and
   development cooperation strategies toward Africa within a theoretical
   and conceptual framework, assessing their impact and significance on the
   continent. The research problem addresses how Turkiye's unique approach,
   which integrates historical ties, cultural interactions, and development
   efforts, distinguishes it from other global and regional actors. The
   arguments presented highlight that Turkiye's humanitarian diplomacy
   strategy, based on mutual benefit and sustainable development goals, has
   effectively enhanced its positive image and influence in Africa. The
   hypothesis posits that Turkiye's humanitarian diplomacy and development
   cooperation efforts have strengthened its position as a humanitarian
   actor on the continent and contributed to achieving sustainable
   development goals. The findings suggest that the country's activities in
   healthcare, education, agriculture, and socio-cultural fields have
   created significant impacts, improving local communities' living
   conditions and fostering sustainable development. Furthermore, Turkiye's
   distinct approach, unlike traditional Western policies, is characterized
   by an emphasis on mutual interdependence and cooperation, positioning it
   as a reliable partner in Africa.},

Abstract = {When parties cooperate, they are perceived as closer together in an
   ideological space than when they compete. This mechanism has only been
   tested at the national level and researchers have disregarded the
   complex interaction between parties competing and cooperating at various
   levels of a polity. This article argues that complex multi-level systems
   have an influence on the voters' perceptions, especially for coalition
   parties. More specifically, the hypothesis is that voters perceive those
   national parties that are in government in their Bundesland as closer
   together on a left-right scale, even though they are not members of the
   same coalition at the national level. The hypothesis is tested by
   relying on GLES data from 2009-2021. National government participation
   and political sophistication are also taken into account as moderating
   variables. The results have important implications for understanding
   party perceptions and the effect of regional government participation in
   multi-level systems.},

Abstract = {The relationship between government defence expenditure and economic
   growth is a debated topic. This study uses UK data for the period of
   1960-2012 and applies two of the most prevailing theories used within
   the literature, the `Feder-Ram' and the `augmented Solow' models, to
   assess this question. We utilise traditional model specifications,
   alongside extensively altered versions of both models, enabling a
   comprehensive comparison between them. The alterations to the models
   include re-evaluating how core variables are expressed, inclusion of
   measures of conflict, the impact of recession, etc. The results show
   that the augmented Solow model outperforms the Feder-Ram model, and we
   provide some explanations for this result. In addition, our results
   suggest that military expenditure has a positive effect on economic
   growth within the UK, implying that the decision to reduce defence
   spending may have been detrimental to the UK economy.},

Abstract = {Academic conferences are important institutions for promoting new
   research and facilitating conversations about the field. As a venue for
   knowledge exchange, professional development, and networking,
   conferences ideally promote positive environments that make scholars
   from underrepresented groups feel welcome. Yet, negative experiences at
   conferences are well documented. Codes of conduct have been promoted as
   tools to reduce harassment and discrimination. This article examines the
   prevalence and content of codes at US-based political science
   conferences and workshops. More specifically, we analyze whether and how
   codes address issues of sexual misconduct and identity-based
   discrimination. We find that 19\% of 177 surveyed conferences have a
   code of conduct. Conferences that are older and larger are more likely
   to have codes, as are conferences that are run by organizations with
   permanent staff and relevant committees. We argue that effective
   conference codes must contain definitions, reporting channels, and
   enforcement procedures. Many of the analyzed codes did not explicitly
   define prohibited behaviors, specify mechanisms to report code
   violations, or describe consequences for misconduct.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the issue of heroism as a sufficient condition for
   the acquisition of citizenship. I define heroism as exceptional,
   supererogatory, and risky acts of altruism and heroic citizenship as the
   reward for a heroic action carried out by a non-citizen resident of
   membership rights. I mobilize in particular the case of Mamoudou
   Gassama, `the Spiderman of Paris', who was naturalized by the French
   President in 2018 after saving a child. While such positive outcomes for
   people in precarious legal and political situations are valuable, I
   provide a critical analysis of the ideological scaffolding and political
   meaning of heroic citizenship, i.e. how it is publicly justified and
   practiced. I argue that heroic citizenship constitutes a fiat of
   citizenship that reproduces a problematic picture of citizenship,
   relying on three ideological tropes: nationalism, sovereigntism, and
   moralism. Heroic citizenship represents the other side of a broader
   policy trend that has transformed citizenship into a privilege to earn.},

Abstract = {What strategies do competitive authoritarian regimes use to target
   local-level opposition gains? How and why can these strategies vary
   subnationally? We analyse how national-level identity politics shapes
   regimes' repression calculus at the local level. We suggest permissive
   prejudice leads regimes to choose harsher strategies in localities
   governed by stigmatized minority groups than in majority-led localities.
   To study this phenomenon, we identify three strategies varying in
   degrees of severity and visibility, and present an original dataset of
   repressive events in Turkey's municipalities from 2016-2022. We argue
   anti-Kurdish prejudice explains the ruling AKP's use of a harsh strategy
   of leader replacement in 149 cases of Kurdish-led municipalities yet
   only one Turkish-led municipality. Supporting our claim, the AKP used
   behind-the-scenes hamstringing to obstruct opposition mayors in
   Turkish-led municipalities. Our findings highlight the permissive and
   restrictive roles that identity politics plays in shaping local-level
   repression and wider patterns of authoritarian consolidation.},

Abstract = {Trust in Australian political institutions has declined markedly since
   2007. Trust scholars and social capital theorists argue that
   institutional trust affects social trust, which implies that declining
   trust in political institutions should also reduce social trust.
   However, using data from the Australian Election Study, World Values
   Survey and HILDA panel study, I find no evidence of any aggregate-level
   decline in Australian social trust since 2007. While this could be a
   result of the `coup era' in Australian politics from 2010 to 2018, a
   better explanation is that social trust remained high because permanent
   changes in trust occur primarily among younger people. A long-term
   decline through generational replacement therefore remains possible.
   This challenges both social capital theory and institutional theories of
   social trust, but would explain the experiences of other advanced
   democracies during episodes of political crisis, including New Zealand,
   Greece, Finland, Japan, Sweden, Spain and the United States.},

Abstract = {Responding to the growing political success of populist radical right
   parties, scholars have increasingly examined those parties relationship
   to democracy. While some consider these parties as a democratic
   corrective to a crisis of political representation, others point to
   their ideological conflict with the principles of liberal democracy. We
   contribute to this debate by exploring the understanding of democracy of
   populist radical right youth leaders. Specifically, we conducted nine
   qualitative semi-structured expert interviews with leaders and executive
   members of the populist radical right youth wings in Austria (Ring
   Freiheitlicher Jugend/RFJ) and Germany (Junge Alternative/JA). To
   determine their understanding of democracy, we utilised a vignette
   technique to simulate governmental decision-making in resolving specific
   political scenarios. The findings indicate that although the youth
   leaders recognise democracy as such, their understanding of democracy
   contains majoritarian and anti-egalitarian aspects that might indirectly
   curtail liberal principles of democracy. This study thus provides an
   in-depth analysis of the motivations underlying the intentions of
   populist radical right youth leaders toward potential transformations of
   democratic institutions.},

Title = {Protest types and protester profiles: testing meso-micro-associations

Abstract = {Can we infer individual characteristics of protest participants by
   examining the demonstrations they go to? Public debate and academic
   literature both tend to make such inferences from the meso- to the
   micro-level. This article tests whether this practice is empirically
   warranted. We first identify the expectations on individual protester
   characteristics in three prominent classifications of protest events:
   collective vs. connective, instrumental vs. expressive, and
   particularistic vs universalistic protests. We then use event-level
   information to classify eight major protest events, held in Germany
   between 2003 and 2020, on these three dimensions. Building on a unique
   sample of protesters at these events (N = 4310), we test whether these
   protest types are linked to individual-level differences in (1)
   participants' involvement in social movement organizations, (2) their
   external efficacy, and (3) their degree of trust in political
   institutions and satisfaction with democracy. We find support for
   meso-micro-associations in all three dimensions. However, we also find
   that meso-micro-links are generally stronger for an issue-based
   classification into progressive and non-progressive events. Furthermore,
   we demonstrate that, among the three dimensions, only the
   collective-connective one can reliably be operationalized on the meso-
   and on the micro-level. The article contributes to the literature on the
   diversity of protest crowds, introduces empirical nuance to the practice
   of binary categorization of protest events, and challenges the
   explanatory performance of abstract versus more concrete, issue-based
   event classifications.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to contribute to our understanding of media influence
   on political behaviour by investigating the ways in which people with
   different personality types react to candidates' conflicting rhetoric in
   televised debates during election campaigns. It analyses responses along
   three reaction types: evaluations of candidate character, debate
   performance, and voting intentions in two debate clips from the 2019 UK
   general election and 2022 Australian federal election. The study uses
   semi-structured interviews with respondents in the UK and relies on
   deductive, flexible thematic analysis. The findings show that
   respondents' personality traits are associated with different reactions
   to conflict in televised debates, which are sometimes mediated by the
   nature of attack, partisanship and preconceptions about candidates
   especially in the UK debate.},

Abstract = {How do the different opinions of stakeholders affect the legislative
   duration in the initial stage of the decision-making process? The
   European Union has long highlighted the significance of interacting with
   and involving representative stakeholders in legislative
   decision-making. It is assumed that a crucial determinant of the
   duration of legislative decision-making is the intensity of preference
   conflicts between different stakeholders on legislative initiatives.
   Therefore, this study examines the specific diverging preferences of
   stakeholders on legislative initiatives that may affect the duration of
   decision-making. The arguments are tested using a dataset of 5561
   contributions from different stakeholders through public consultations
   over 100 legislative proposals in the period 2000-2017. The results
   indicate that the more intense divisions in opinions among external
   stakeholders could lead to a longer legislative decision-making process.
   More importantly, divisions within interest groups within the EU context
   last significantly longer than those within non-state groups during the
   legislative process.},

Abstract = {Spatial governance involves studying the relationship between trade, and
   politics, resolving tensions, and harmonizing various social forces
   within a spatial domain within the framework of democratic governance
   models. The importance of this approach in space management stems from
   the increasing delegation of government responsibilities and powers to
   the non-governmental sector. Political space managers need to use
   strategic plans to achieve sustainable development and spatial justice.
   The general objectives of this research are an understanding of
   strategic planning and to apply it in one of the aspects of regional
   development, to explain the steps and process of strategic planning, and
   also how to determine and prioritize strategies. This research is
   descriptive in nature and applied-developmental in terms of purpose. The
   method of collecting information is a library, face-to-face interviews
   with experts, personal observation, and questionnaire completion. SWOT
   analysis method has been used to determine the importance and weighting
   of internal and external factors and to formulate strategies. A
   quantitative strategic planning matrix (QSPM) has been used to measure
   the attractiveness of each of the desired strategies. The results of the
   study indicate that conservative strategies are proposed as executive
   strategies in the Central District of Arak County, Iran.},

Abstract = {Starting in the 1980s, U.S. voters began dividing on the abortion issue
   into pro-life Republicans and pro-choice Democrats. This study shows
   that the predominant direction of causality was that abortion opinion
   caused changes in partisanship rather than the reverse, which then had
   downstream consequences for vote choice. Working with the Youth Parent
   Socialization Panel Study, I show that those taking pro-choice and
   pro-life positions in 1982 subsequently changed their party
   identification to align with those views. By contrast, Democrats and
   Republicans, as of 1982, did not realign their abortion positions. The
   partisan conversions were concentrated among ideologically engaged (IE)
   respondents, especially IE women, who found themselves out of step with
   their party on abortion. By triggering changes in party identification,
   panelists' abortion stances as early as 1982 influenced their vote
   choices downstream in the 1996 presidential election. Thus, issue-based
   realignment is viewed here in real time with data from a panel study.},

Abstract = {The ``White Replacement{''} conspiracy theory, that governments and
   corporations are ``replacing{''} white people, is linked to several mass
   shootings. Given its recent ubiquity in elite rhetoric, concerns have
   arisen about the popularity of this conspiracy theory among the United
   States mass public. Further, political scientists have noted a need to
   understand why people believe or act upon this conspiracy theory. Using
   a 2022 US national survey (n = 2001), we find that a third of Americans
   agree that leaders are replacing white people with people of color.
   These beliefs are related to anti-social personality traits, various
   forms of nationalist and authoritarian sentiments, and negative
   sentiments toward immigrants, minorities, women, and the political
   establishment. Regression analysis however fails to find significant
   effects of partisanship and ideology on these beliefs. Further, we
   observed that these beliefs are related to a desire to engage in both
   normative (e.g., run for political office) and nonnormative political
   participation (e.g., commit violence). Given the popularity of White
   Replacement conspiracy theories in the US and elsewhere, our findings
   suggest new avenues for research into potentially dangerous beliefs, as
   well as xenophobia, antisemitism, racism, sexism, extremism, and
   political violence.},

Abstract = {Responsiveness to voters is key for democratic rule, yet often fails to
   occur. We argue that coalition government adds an additional hurdle to
   responsiveness. Multi-issue policy log-rolls between coalition parties
   in coalition agreement negotiations, none of which are individually
   supported by a parliamentary majority, can lead to policy change opposed
   by a majority, that is: Minority rule. Similarly, coalition agreements
   can block policy change supported by a parliamentary majority through a
   veto by one of the government parties, frustrating majority rule.
   Drawing on data from the Netherlands Bureau of Economic Analysis, we
   assess how often coalition agreements include policies supported by less
   than a parliamentary majority, and how often they exclude policies
   supported by parliamentary majorities. We show that two-thirds of
   policies included in coalition agreements are not supported by a floor
   majority, and that 30\% of policies supported by a floor majority fail
   to be included in a coalition agreement.},

Abstract = {Since the 1970s, feminism has become a prominent force in the political
   arena. In the case of the Southern Cone, feminism experienced a
   resurgence in the 1980s in a context signed by the recovery of political
   mobilization and political transitions. This feminist cycle was
   characterized by the active participation of diverse women who
   intervened in public discourse through various platforms, with feminist
   magazines being one of the most significant. These endeavors, considered
   as alternative press and central instruments in the cultural battle
   against patriarchy, facilitated the politicization of novel themes
   surrounding oppression. The women who led these magazines were
   individuals associated with both the feminist movement and the academic
   periphery. These magazines were not only an instrument for disseminating
   research and fostering feminist awareness but also served as spaces for
   reflection and learning about how knowledge is constructed. This article
   regards feminist magazines such as Brujas in Argentina, La Cacerola in
   Uruguay, and Mulherio in Brazil as laboratories for experimenting with
   knowledge construction in collaboration with society, challenging the
   authoritative mechanisms of university -based knowledge. Within these
   publications, knowledge was constructed through irreverent writing,
   employing graphic humor, denouncing common sense, and disseminating
   canonical books. The magazines thus functioned as instruments in the
   cultural battle and laboratories for feminist knowledge.},

Abstract = {Science is inadequately represented in the defense capabilities
   development of the Republic of Croatia. There are no recognized
   scientific organizations at the state level that specialize in defense
   and security, except in the segment that includes social sciences. The
   Croatian Armed Forces (CAF) possess only the initial organizational and
   personnel prerequisites for systematic integration of science in the
   development and modernization of military and defense capabilities -
   largely due to the unfavorable historical legacy of a non-existent or
   limited state -law framework that failed to develop defense and security
   as a state function. With the cooperation of the government, academic
   community, and industry, this deficiency can be compensated by drawing
   on the best international experiences of NATO and the EU and building a
   viable national ``triple helix{''} model for attaining the required
   defense capabilities. CAF modernization should be centered on an
   objective foresight of the future strategic context and the provision of
   appropriate combat and equipment.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the second release of the Most Important Problem
   Dataset (MIPD) - a publicly available dataset that codes all available
   responses to the most important problem question in American public
   opinion. In the article, we first describe a number of innovations in
   the new release of the dataset and then demonstrate its usefulness
   through illustrative cases. In the new MIPD, we switch from providing a
   single code for the entire response to the various quasi-responses
   contained in the response, added information on the state in which the
   interview took place, and subcategories that include - when relevant -
   information on the preferred levels of policy. These improvements allow
   for more fine-grained categories and facilitate more accurate inferences
   at the individual- and aggregate-level. We also extended the time frame
   through 2020. The new MIPD codes responses from over 850 surveys of more
   than a million Americans from 1939-2020 into 110 issue categories.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the Quebec context that is currently marked by a
   proliferation of mining titles for critical minerals. We examine the
   thesis according to which we have a moral obligation to exploit the land
   based on an energy transition. According to this idea, which is promoted
   by the mining industry and Quebec provincial government, local community
   opposition to mining projects is a case of ``NIMBY.{''} In response to
   this accusation, this article offers a reflection on the relationship
   between political communities and territory based on the work of
   Margaret Moore, Cara Nine, and insights from Green Legal Theory. The
   article concludes that local communities have prima facie right not to
   exploit critical minerals on their territory.},

Abstract = {How does the representation of women in international organizations
   affect the implementation of gender mainstreaming policies? Many
   international organizations have adopted policies to prevent gender
   discrimination in their operations, but their implementation is often
   lackluster. We argue that these shortcomings appear due to a combination
   of institutional incentives and an underrepresentation of women in their
   staff. We test the argument in the case of the World Bank, drawing on
   highly disaggregated staffing data, an instrumental variable strategy,
   and an elite survey experiment. Our results show that most staff
   incorporate at least shallow gender mainstreaming in their projects.
   Deeper implementation of gender mainstreaming is more likely when women
   staff supervise projects, hold positions of authority, and are more
   represented as coworkers. These results contribute to understanding the
   disconnects between talk and action on mainstreaming policies and inform
   debates on representation in global governance.},

Abstract = {Does the content of intergroup contact matter? Despite extensive
   research on the benefits of contact for intergroup relations, we know
   little about what happens during contact-based programs and
   interventions. This article addresses this gap by inductively building
   theory about the desired content of contact. My analysis draws on oral
   history interviews and archival data from the Denton Women's Interracial
   Fellowship: a real-world case of intergroup contact that emerged to ease
   the process of school desegregation in Denton, Texas. My analysis of
   these data moves beyond the scope conditions suggested by (Allport,
   Gordon W. 1954. The Nature of Prejudice. 25th ed. Cambridge, MA: Perseus
   Books) to highlight the role of conversations about outgroup
   experiences. I illuminate how these conversations produce positive
   impacts on intergroup relations and draw out the implications for
   research on intergroup contact: namely, that forms of intergroup contact
   that incorporate these conversations are more likely to improve
   intergroup relations, and that intergroup contact interventions should
   explicitly encourage or incorporate these kinds of conversations.},

Abstract = {This article examines Russia's impartiality during the second Karabakh
   war between Azerbaijan and Armenia in 2020, despite its close
   military-strategic alliance with the latter. Russia's behavior
   represents a twofold deviation: a weakening of its security commitments
   to Armenia, and a more balanced policy in a frozen conflict in the
   post-Soviet space. Four factors are examined that could account for
   explaining this puzzle, namely increasing bandwagoning of Azerbaijan
   with Russia, rising opportunity costs of intervention due to Turkey's
   support to Azerbaijan, Russia's potential discontent with Armenia after
   the 2018 Velvet Revolution, and the role of a justice motive in Russian
   policy toward the conflict.},

Abstract = {When are politicians willing to liberalize abortion laws? While
   restricted access to legal abor- tion affects millions of women around
   the world, there is relatively little understanding of the factors
   shaping the views of politicians who craft or uphold such restrictive
   laws. This study examines the impact of a public health framing commonly
   employed by activists to persuade politicians to reform abortion laws.
   We provide evidence that politicians' preferences toward abortion
   reforms are shaped by the intersection of gender and wealth. Drawing on
   a survey experiment conducted among more than 600 politicians in Zambia,
   we show that only women politicians from less wealthy backgrounds are
   more likely to support policy liberalization after being exposed to a
   public health framing. These findings underscore how economic inequal-
   ities can affect the substantive representation of women's interests and
   provide a baseline for further research on the use of framing strategies
   in other developing country contexts.},

Abstract = {Marxism-feminism is a vital field with diverse voices and different
   political agendas for social justice, from the defense of land and water
   to the reorganization of production. The anthology Marxist-Feminist
   Theories and Struggles Today aims to grasp the originality and relevance
   of that tradition. The book represents a variety of contributions,
   defined as Marxist feminist by their authors, who presented papers at
   the Marxist Feminist Congress in Vienna in 2016. This was the second
   International Marxist Feminist Conference, the first having been
   initiated by the feminist section of the Berlin Institute of Critical
   Theory. Drawing on different theoretical frameworks and practices of
   Marxist feminism, the edited anthology provides an invitation to
   converse about our understanding and practice of engaging gendered,
   racialized heterocapitalism for a better global future. This book
   symposium and its reviewers demonstrate the richness of the resulting
   conversation.},

Abstract = {Autocratic leaders differ considerably in how they consolidate power,
   but what gives rise to these variations remains under-theorized. This
   article studies how informal political constraints associated with
   retired leaders shape intra-elite power dynamics. We argue that ageing
   leaders' efforts to manage the succession problem create an important
   yet impermanent check on the power of subsequent leaders. To test this
   argument, we use the massive text corpus of Google Ngram to develop a
   new measure of power for a global sample of autocratic leaders and
   elites and employ a research design that leverages within-incumbent
   variations in former leaders' influence for identification. We show that
   incumbent leaders' ability to consolidate power becomes more limited
   when operating in an environment where influential former leaders are
   present. Further analyses suggest that the presence of former leaders is
   most effective in reducing incumbents' ability to appoint or remove
   high-level military and civilian personnel unilaterally. These findings
   have implications for our understanding of the dynamics of power-sharing
   and institutional change in autocracies.},

Abstract = {The notion of commons has been reintroduced into the contemporary
   legal-political vocabulary, but there is much confusion about its
   meaning. In this article I attempt to offer some classificatory criteria
   that may be useful in distinguishing diverse uses of the concept. A
   distinction is made between ``natural and social{''} approaches to the
   commons, and between ``localist and globalist{''} conceptions. This
   followed by an analysis of these conceptual tensions in relation to the
   inclusion of the rights of nature and the natural commons in the Chilean
   Constitutional Convention of 2022. It concludes with a response to the
   local/global aporia of the commons, based on Bruno Latour's idea of the
   ``terrestrial{''}.},

Title = {Lessons from a Late Adopter: Feminist Advocacy, Democratizing Reforms,

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {Many Latin American and other Global South countries adopted gender
   quotas during democratic transitions. What explains late-adopting cases
   like Chile? We analyze two instances: the 2015-2016 electoral reforms,
   which finally introduced a 40-percent gender quota, and the 2020-2023
   constitutional process, which introduced gender parity. Using a
   qualitative analysis that draws on 39 elite interviews, we posit that
   efforts to redesign national political institutions in order to address
   democratic deficits create transition-like moments. In turn, these
   moments create windows of opportunity for quota advocates. We show how
   quota advocates in the parties, congress, and civil society leveraged
   growing voter discontent to pressure their resistant colleagues and
   ultimately secure gender quotas (and later gender parity) as part of
   larger reform efforts. Our analysis of the Chilean case elevates two
   factors explaining quota adoption: the long arc of democratization and
   women's role as protagonists in electoral reforms.},

Abstract = {After \#MeToo, academics have become increasingly focused on the liberal
   concept of consent. Either problematized as a means of distinguishing
   between sex and rape, or vaunted as a tool for having better sex,
   consent remains central to discussions of sexual violence. Returning to
   Andrea Dworkin's thought, this article argues that contemporary
   feminists must move beyond consent and recenter the problem of violence
   to theorize rape. Dworkin, alongside Catharine MacKinnon and Carole
   Pateman, critiques consent for disguising the violence of rape, sex, and
   pornography. By defining violence as a process of objectification,
   Dworkin exposes rape, pornography, and most controversially, consensual
   heterosexual intercourse as ``a new kind of death.{''} She, in turn,
   calls for the feminist exercise of violence as a tactic of disclosure
   that promises to make visible patriarchal violence hidden by consent and
   sexualization. Moving beyond consent to recenter the problem of
   violence, I conclude, opens up new avenues for feminist action and
   brings into view the seemingly unthinkable possibility of a world
   without rape.},

Abstract = {Imagine two incidents of political violence. In the first, you share
   political affiliation with the victim. In the second, they reside in the
   opposite party. How would this minor change - a shifting label, the
   difference of a word - impact your reaction? This article offers
   empirical insight through an experiment: U.S. participants read a mock
   college controversy, where a student sent death threats to, and doxed, a
   professor. The treatment varied whether the perpetrator described the
   professor as a Democrat, Republican, or used otherwise non-descript
   (e.g., ``political{''}) adjectives. A posttreatment survey then measured
   respondents' discrete emotions, the penalties they preferred the student
   receive, and their partisan group identity strength. Participants who
   read about violence against a copartisan victim showed a statistically
   significant increase in preferred penalty severity. But violence against
   an outparty victim mirrored the control, with subjects reacting as if
   they didn't know the political affiliation of anyone involved.
   Posttreatment measures also demonstrated the potential for anxiety (but
   not anger or partisan strength) to mediate this underlying partisan
   bias.},

Abstract = {Over the past 30 years, the United States has developed a rural-urban
   political divide, as rural voters have become increasingly reliable
   Republican voters while long-term patterns of Democratic voting in the
   largest cities have also consolidated in many smaller cities and suburbs
   as well. Yet, although 1 in 4 rural dwellers now identify as people of
   color, research on the rural-urban divide has either mostly centered on
   the behavior and attitudes of non-Hispanic whites, or assumed that
   nonwhites have exhibited similar behavior to whites. Does this political
   cleavage exist among people of color? We find that the growing
   rural-urban divide is driven primarily by white Americans, while rural
   people of color differ much less, if at all, from their urban
   counterparts in voting behavior and policy attitudes. In addition to
   highlighting the need for more research on the politics of rural people
   of color, our findings raise concerns about the political representation
   of rural Black Americans and Latinos.},

Title = {Charter-manifesto congruence as a signal for issue salience: democratic
   innovations within political parties in Hungary},

Pages = {1465-1488},

Abstract = {This article proposes a proxy for issue salience via studying congruence
   between parties' organizational structure and the policies they promote
   to their voters. This charter-manifesto congruence, i.e.
   institutionalizing the same democratic innovations at the intra-party
   level and advocating for their adoption at the national level, is
   particularly useful to demarcate party profiles in dominant party
   systems and electoral autocracies. To demonstrate how such congruence
   can be measured, we analyse the credibility of the commitments made by
   opposition parties in Hungary to a variety of democratic innovations.
   Drawing on novel survey data, we further substantiate our argument by
   showing high support for these innovations among party members and
   voters. The analysis identifies gender quotas as the most congruent
   innovation. Our longitudinal research design also reveals a recent
   breakthrough of e-democracy in party manifestos. We then discuss how
   preferences for various innovations are potentially shaped by membership
   size, party founders' political socialization or organizational
   learning. At the normative level, the analysis suggests that some forms
   of democratic innovations are better suited for intra-party
   organizations than for party manifestos. These implications might be
   relevant for those committed to promoting deliberation, gender equality
   and (re-)engagement of the youth in politics.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of digital technology in enabling and
   enhancing democratic practices and forms of governance. It contributes
   to emerging debates on democratic innovations by proposing a novel
   theoretical account of decentralized participatory democracy. To develop
   our account, we draw on the experience of two EU-funded projects, D-CENT
   and DECODE, which produced innovative citizen participation platforms
   and digital public infrastructure. Bringing democratic theory into
   conversation with critical data studies and the new municipalism
   movement, we theorize how these projects advanced three political aims:
   organizing political communities to build collective power, empowering
   citizens through direct participation in decision making, and
   transforming political institutions. The article then analyzes the
   strengths and limitations of these projects to draw lessons for policy
   makers and practitioners for future digital democratic experiments.},

Abstract = {With the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion Ukraine started
   actively utilize the trope of postcolonial struggle in its external
   strategic communication. Such positionality was intended to take
   relations with the global South to a new level. The aim of this article
   is twofold: empirically, it seeks to discuss how the idea of
   postcolonialism in its policy-oriented interpretation contributes to the
   positional rapprochement of Ukraine and the global South. The author
   argues that employing such narrative has its logic but also significant
   limitations. Conceptually, the article unpacks three different
   interpretations of the concept of post-coloniality in academic
   literature and analyses how they are applicable to Ukraine's
   postcolonial posture.},

Abstract = {Informal, `notice-and-comment', rulemaking is the prototypical mechanism
   employed by US regulators. However, agencies frequently claim their
   actions exempt from the process, and courts typically agree. Agencies
   thus face an important strategic choice between informal rulemaking and
   avoidance. To study this choice, we analyze a model of rulemaking with
   exemption and empirically analyze agency avoidance. Our model implies
   that more biased agencies engage in less avoidance, as they face more
   skepticism from the courts and, thus, require support from group
   comments to have their rules upheld. Empirically, we find support for
   this prediction. As for policy implications, we show it is more
   beneficial to allow exemptions when the agency is more biased.},

Abstract = {South Sudan has a long history of civil wars and intra-communal
   violence. Northern Bahr el-Ghazal (NBeG) state, including Aweil East
   County, similarly to other pastoralist and agro-pastoralist communities,
   stood out in terms of intra-communal violence. However, since the second
   civil war (1983-2005), larger-scale local-level violence has
   substantially reduced and conflicts are settled in different dispute
   resolution forums. This paper explores factors reducing intra-communal
   violence in Aweil East. It demonstrates that the Sudan People's
   Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) has shaped local governance, justice,
   security, peace and political constellations since the second civil war
   well into the era of the independent South Sudan.},

Abstract = {Current research suggests that all states share a perpetual appetite for
   extraction and standardization. However, this research overlooks the
   fact that subnational regions present different appeals and challenges
   to ruling coalitions. While states seek to extend bureaucratic rule over
   peripheries with valuable assets and favorable geography, they might
   instead seek to preserve local patrimonial bastions when those areas
   offer substantial electoral support. In turn, these strategies lead to
   broad subnational heterogeneity in the reach of the state. This paper
   focuses on regions' ecological, military, and clientelistic features to
   explain local trajectories of bureaucratic rule and country-level state
   capacity. Empirically, I examine Chile, a successful case of
   capacity-building in Latin America. Prompted by a fiscal crisis in the
   mid-1850s, Chile's central government launched state-building projects
   to offset its budgetary deficit. Using GIS and original data from
   censuses, budgets, and other primary sources, I show that Chile's ruling
   coalition paradoxically modernized the country's peripheries while
   deepening its own traditionalism. These results challenge prevailing
   narratives about the projection of political authority and Chile's
   territorial uniformity.},

Abstract = {Sustainability researchers are writing much about levers for
   transformations towards sustainability but too little about the most
   powerful means available for obstructing and activating them:
   mass-reaching media systems. How media systems are structured and
   governed form a profoundly important meta-level layer of decision-making
   that ought to be central in the study of environmental politics and in
   environmental policymaking. A politics- and media-focused account of the
   rise of Jair Bolsonaro to the presidency of Brazil illustrates the
   essential role of media systems and the need for new principles,
   structures, and policies for their governance if the interlinked goals
   of democracy, equity, and environmental protection are to be achieved.
   The pervasive inattention to this in environmental research reinforces
   hegemonic forces and needs to be widely discussed, understood, and
   overcome to achieve much needed just transformations towards
   sustainability.},

Abstract = {We conduct a global, large-N analysis of proportionality in the partisan
   distribution of cabinet portfolios. Formulated in the context of postwar
   Western European parliamentary democracy, Gamson's Law predicts that
   parties joining a coalition government will receive cabinet ministries
   in direct proportion to the seats they are contributing to the coalition
   on the floor of the legislature. Using a sample of 1551 country-years of
   coalitional government in 97 countries from 1966 to 2019, and comparing
   all main constitutional formats (parliamentary, presidential, and
   semi-presidential), we find that Gamson's Law does not travel well
   outside its context of origin. Among the constitutional predictors of
   cabinet proportionality, we find that pure presidentialism is a major
   outlier, with an exaggerated form of formateur advantage. Introducing
   party-system and assembly-level predictors to the debate, we find that
   party institutionalization tends to increase fairness in portfolio
   allocation within parliamentary systems only.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the centrality of passports and identification
   documents (or their lack thereof) in peoples' everyday lives and life
   chances, particularly in the contexts of forced displacement and
   protracted conflict. While the production of largely internationally
   unrecognized passports reasserts the logics of the globally dominant
   modern nation-state order, it also lays bare the problematic, fragile,
   and performative qualities of that system. I argue that the bureaucratic
   processes of document production for wartime migrants reveal the
   racializing effects of codified legal and ethnic classifications. As
   such, the production of passports and legal identification documents
   plays a formative role in the ethno-racial exclusions embedded in
   statecraft projects. This paper invites readers to consider how
   passports and identification documents affect multiple aspects of life,
   including access to work opportunities, mobility, and housing-and how
   people creatively traverse the confinments of these documents and their
   bureaucratic categories.},

Abstract = {This article aims to examine the realization of the Global Maritime
   Fulcrum (GMF) and its repercussion on ``free and active foreign
   policy{''} in Indonesia, in the context of the country's need for
   infrastructure investment and rising tensions due to China's economic
   dominance through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). To achieve GMF's
   five main pillars, primarily maritime connectivity, the Indonesian
   government has received a large amount of loans from Asia Infrastructure
   Investment Bank (AIIB) and allowed Chinese direct investment (CDI),
   including infrastructure investment such as Industrial Parks. However,
   there are concerns that this could endanger one of Indonesia's
   fundamental foreign policies, which has been ``free and active{''} since
   its independence. The research concludes that between 2014 and 2019,
   increased Chinese direct investment in Indonesia contributed to GMF,
   mainly through infrastructure investments and maritime connectivity, yet
   to employ GMF without violating free and active foreign policy, Joko
   Widodo's approach was conducted through middle power strategy.},

Abstract = {Spain's mainstream right parties immediately cooperated with the radical
   right Vox as a support party for minority governments when it first
   entered regional parliaments in 2018 and 2019. We ask why the mainstream
   right opted to engage the radical right to govern and why the latter
   agreed. Only when we consider parties' regional and national goals can
   we explain why the parties allied in Spain, and then only when we
   consider electoral as well as policy and office goals. We argue that
   centrifugal two bloc competition in the party system and electoral
   competition among the mainstream right parties on territorial and
   national identity issues encouraged engagement. Further, we show how the
   right bloc developed and solidified and how Vox constrained mainstream
   party choices by pushing for public recognition. It demonstrates the
   value of examining subnational politics, not only as another arena, but
   also as integral to party strategies.},

Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Number = {40},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The growth of e -commerce and B2C (business to consumer) distribution
   systems is generating significant impacts on various aspects of our
   cities. This is clearly reflected in the environmental context, as the
   intense mobility of vehicles dedicated to package delivery to households
   contributes to congestion and increased use of public roads. Likewise,
   there is a negative impact on traditional urban commerce, as part of
   commercial activity has shifted from local traditional establishments to
   online platforms. In response to this situation, in recent years, public
   authorities have been exploring measures to levy taxes on these
   activities. One of the latest initiatives is the introduction of a
   delivery fee for e -commerce in the city of Barcelona, which certain
   postal operators meeting specific requirements must pay. This paper not
   only examines the legal structure of this fee but also explores tensions
   that have arisen between the sector and the municipality, as some actors
   have legally challenged the application of this fee. Additionally, it
   addresses considerations for the future, as the continued growth of
   these distribution systems is inevitable, and it is likely that many
   other municipalities will implement similar taxes in their territories.},

   journalistic roles but under increasing pressure},
Journal = {ICELANDIC REVIEW OF POLITICS \& ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {In this article we examine changes in role perceptions of Icelandic
   journalists and the pressure they perceive on their daily work. The
   media environment in Iceland has gone through drastic changes in recent
   years which has, as in other countries, altered the way news is
   produced, distributed, received, and the overall role the news media
   plays in society. Increasing competition for peoples' attention, the
   impact of the internet, social media and powerful tech giants, have
   among other things resulted in financial difficulties in the media
   market, bankruptcy and layoffs. The purpose of the research presented
   here is to examine if and how these changes have affected journalists'
   views about their role in society and if they perceive increased
   pressure on their work. We present data from the international
   comparative Worlds of Journalism Study (WJS) in Iceland from 2021
   (n=239). The new data is both quantitative and qualitative, i.e., a
   survey among the news journalism population in the country and
   qualitative indepth interviews with 30 journalists. The findings are
   compared to the results from WJS in 2012. Our results indicate that
   Icelandic journalists place greater emphasis now than a decade earlier
   on classic journalistic roles, such as being a detached observer and
   scrutinizing those in power. At the same time, they report encountering
   more external interference and pressure in their work, especially
   journalists working for private media outlets but to a lesser extent
   those in the Public Service Media.},

Abstract = {This commentary examines the transformation of vocational education in T
   \& uuml;rkiye, addressing its challenges, innovations, and impacts. T \&
   uuml;rkiyes' system, including the Vocational and Technical Anatolian
   High School (MTAL) and the Vocational Training Center (MESEM), has
   historically faced difficulties due to policies like the ``coefficient
   application,{''} which restricted access to higher education for
   vocational graduates. Recent reforms, such as a revamped management
   model, industry collaboration, enhanced production processes, and
   integration of research and development (R\&D) and intellectual property
   (IP) culture, have increased enrollment rates, improved education
   quality, and enabled rapid production of essential goods during crises.
   These changes have also advanced vocational training in the defense
   industry, attracting top-performing students. Consequently, these
   reforms have addressed vocational education challenges and contributed
   to societal improvements, including reduced youth unemployment and
   increased womens' employment, positioning T \& uuml;rkiye as a model for
   vocational education globally.},

Journal = {LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Even before its founding, town hall meetings have been woven into the
   fabric of American politics as a quintessential tool in a representative
   democracy. We might expect legislators would host these events with
   routine frequency; however, our research shows this conventional wisdom
   is inaccurate. While town halls may strengthen the
   legislator-constituent relationship, they also carry risk, especially in
   our polarized political climate. We argue the decision to engage with
   constituents in this way is a two-step process: first, legislators
   decide whether to participate in town halls or not; second, they
   determine the frequency (and modality) of these interactions. We
   consider several factors to explain the variation of town hall
   participation among members of Congress, including partisanship and
   gender, as well as several electoral and district-level factors. By
   combining a unique data set of nearly 11,000 congressional town hall
   meetings from 2017 to 2022 (115th-117th Congresses) with biographical
   and political information about legislators and their districts, we
   uncover compelling evidence to suggest legislators make strategic
   calculations of whether to participate in town hall meetings and how to
   do so. In the end, our work adds to the growing literature on the modern
   electoral connection.},

Abstract = {This article addresses backlash from white academic gatekeepers to
   research on the white far right and white supremacist violence.
   Centrally, I interrogate how whiteness shapes the field's response to a
   seeming shift in patterns of political violence towards white
   supremacist activity. Taking white supremacy in the study of white
   supremacist violence seriously, I contend, would shift our attention to
   larger social patterns of oppression and opportunities for liberation.
   However, this does not happen due to a concept I call ``whiteness as
   expertise.{''} Building on Charles W. Mills' white epistemologies of
   ignorance, I argue that the attributes of transferability and
   disconnection both obscure and perpetuate how scholarship on white
   supremacist violence can further whiteness. First, I review the backlash
   experienced by the academic and policy turn towards white supremacist
   violence, even if scholars and practitioners may not call it ``white
   supremacist.{''} I then introduce the concept of whiteness as expertise
   in more detail, highlighting how insistence on ``terrorism{''} as a
   unitary and unifying category leads to backlash against research on
   white supremacist violence. I conclude with examples of academic
   backlash to open discussion into the complexities of studying whiteness
   within a white-majority academy.},

Abstract = {Why did America's twenty-year war in Afghanistan fail to establish a
   self-sustaining non-Taliban government? Analysts have cited cultural
   obstacles in Afghanistan, bureaucratic inertia in Washington, and a lack
   of strategic commitment, in part because Iraq dominated national
   security policy. Such claims tend to draw evidence from Germany, Japan,
   and Iraq, places where the U.S. military achieved some measure of
   success establishing pro-American governments. The present article
   broadens the comparison to consider Afghanistan alongside Germany,
   Japan, Iraq, and two examples of post-Cold War regime-change success:
   Panama (1989-1990) and Haiti (1994-1995). The cases indicate that U.S.
   influence in the postwar environment has depended on the prospects for
   integrating old regime elites into the new government and on the
   strength of indigenous opposition forces. Both variables were
   unfavorable in Afghanistan, and they shaped the boundaries of political
   order-no matter how hard U.S. forces fought or how long they stayed.},

Abstract = {In real life, winning a conflict sometimes does not end the conflict.
   Revenge motivations can stay and provide momentum to the conflict, thus
   leading to further escalation of the conflict. This is known as the
   value effect or vengeance effect of revenge. However, the presence of
   revenge can lead to de-escalation of the conflict out of self-deterrence
   and sometimes retaliation out of revenge is not possible if the
   combatant is incapacitated. Hence, the impact of revenge on the level of
   violence is a priori not clear. This paper is an attempt to answer that
   question. Using a two-period game of conflict this paper tries to show
   how desire and capabilities of the combatants to exact revenge can
   influence the intensity of the conflict. This paper shows the following:
   how the strategies of the combatants are influenced by the value effect
   of revenge, self-deterrence and incapacitation of the combatants; how
   the stronger combatant is in a favourable position in the conflict and
   can prevent its opponent from going into second period conflict out of
   revenge; when the combatants are equally strong the intensity of the
   conflict starts falling with time. It also lays out some real-life
   conflicts and existing empirical work to support the results.},

Abstract = {While public administration research has traditionally paid profound
   attention to democratic values in government-citizen relations, public
   institutions are still wrestling with entrenching human rights norms
   today. This article's Democracy and Human Rights in Public
   Administration (DHR-PA) perspective offers a view that a human
   rights-anchored reforms agenda may assist with setting the much-needed
   tone for realizing democratic norms in African administrative contexts
   where society is still dealing with extreme forms of human rights
   abuses. It operationalizes institutional nuances and qualities of
   democratic and human rights values using Afrobarometer's Round 9 dataset
   for Namibia, Kenya, and Nigeria. Results show that human rights
   proclivities of African public administration remain subtle and nebulous
   despite more targeted DHR-PA reforms and the creation of institutions
   like human rights commissions and administrative justice agencies.
   Overall, for democracy to work, African public administration must
   acquire and entrench human rights norms and values in its engagements
   with citizens.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper explores the connection between the current wave of populism,
   economic policies and governance practices. We first review the
   different ways in which populist political economy has been
   conceptualised, focusing on the relationship between populism and
   neoliberalism in terms of both policy and polity. We then briefly
   discuss right-wing populist governments' recent economic policies and
   institutional changes. We argue that, while representing a continuation
   of neoliberalism in some areas, right-wing populism may, when in power,
   undermine neoliberal economic policies and institutional power by
   subverting governance norms and reintroducing the state as a major actor
   in the economy. To demonstrate and support our argument, we analyse the
   Israeli case, in which the right-wing populist leader Benjamin Netanyahu
   led three governmental coalitions between 2009 and 2019. We focus on the
   Israeli government's response to the cost-of-living crisis and the
   housing crisis. We show that the populist Israeli government went beyond
   clientelism and welfare chauvinism and moved towards a more
   redistributive and expansionist economic agenda. To finance and
   legislate this agenda, it used unorthodox, short-term governance
   practices to bypass or overcome institutional limitations.},

Abstract = {Despite pundit claims that field campaigns contributed to the Australian
   Greens Party and independent candidates' successes in the 2022 federal
   election, little is known about the activities conducted. The use and
   development of novel activities has been established, but what happens
   on the ground remains largely invisible. Comparing the results of
   semistructured interviews with participants from across the Australian
   Greens Party and the `teal' independents (N = 73), this article develops
   a new understanding of the activities of field campaigning and
   illuminates the differences between independent and party campaigns. The
   Greens are shown to focus more on traditional voter contact activities,
   while the independent campaigns prioritise visibility and volunteer
   participation. From these results, this study establishes a new
   definition of field campaigning and clarifies the way in which
   institutional knowledge, or the lack thereof, shapes the conception and
   development of campaign activities.},

Title = {The moral economy of the English football crowd: The European Super
   League and the contingency of football fan activism},
Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {On 18 April 2021, six of the most storied clubs in English football -
   Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool, Manchester United and
   Tottenham Hotspur - announced they would be joining a new breakaway
   European Super League. These proposals triggered vehement opposition
   from football fans, which catalysed the intervention of the UK
   government in the form of a fan-led review of football governance. The
   reaction to the European Super League - which collapsed within 48 hours
   - demonstrates that the commodification and globalisation of football is
   contested. This article applies the lens of moral economy to analyse the
   contemporary mobilisations of football fans in England counter to these
   processes. The novel application of a moral economy framework provides a
   fresh perspective within the extant literature on football fan activism.
   This article represents the first systematic application of a moral
   economy approach to the political sociology of contemporary sport and
   its fandom. Employing an expanded understanding of moral economy, the
   article extends its application beyond the analysis of pre-modern food
   riots popularised by E.P. Thompson, incorporating the insights of Karl
   Polanyi and Andrew Sayer. Adopting this broader meaning, the concept of
   moral economy enables us to explore emergent and dynamic forms of fan
   activism, which seek to contest the commodification of football. The
   supporter mobilisations against the European Super League are examined
   to illuminate this perspective. Through an exploration of the
   contingency of the moral economy of football fandom, this article
   expands, in conceptual terms, the literature on football-based social
   movements, connecting it to the wider commodification and
   financialisation of football (as an important aspect of everyday life)

Abstract = {This research note investigates whether external military crises, short
   of war, in the neighbourhood of the European Union (EU) affects
   attitudes toward the EU. Specifically, I explore whether the Russian
   aggression against Ukraine in 2014 fostered higher levels of trust in
   the EU and support for deeper integration among European citizens.
   Methodologically, I exploit the coincidental timing of the Russian
   annexation of Crimea on 18 March, 2014 with the fieldwork of the
   Eurobarometer survey (81.2) conducted in the spring of that year. The
   quasi-experimental evidence establishes that European citizens who were
   surveyed after the Russian annexation became more trusting of the EU and
   presented a greater willingness for further European integration,
   particularly so among EU-15 members. Moreover, the treatment effects
   were strongly moderated by individuals' education levels, with the
   intervention exerting its greatest effect among the higher educated.},

Title = {Regulating surrogacy across Western Europe: A usual case of (gendered)
   morality politics?},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {22},
Number = {5},
Pages = {638-661},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The regulation of surrogacy across Western Europe displays the
   overwhelming prevalence of a restrictive status quo, with only a few
   states having moved towards greater permissiveness. However, we know
   little about the determinants of such regulation from a comparative
   perspective. This article fills this gap, by mapping the variation in
   the regulation of surrogacy across Western Europe and determining
   whether the explanations offered by the morality politics literature to
   the attendant variation in the regulation of abortion, prostitution and
   assisted reproductive technologies also explain it, or, rather,
   surrogacy policy has its own determinants. It concludes that, while the
   factors that explain the variation in the permissiveness of the
   regulation of abortion, prostitution and assisted reproduction
   technologies across Western Europe also apply to surrogacy, their
   specific combination in the latter is unlike in any of the former.
   Hence, surrogacy policy has its own determinants, which require further
   research. In doing so, the article adds to the emerging comparative
   analysis of surrogacy policies across Western Europe from a morality
   politics perspective, which is unprecedented, and, in turn, to the
   literature on morality politics, by confronting it to an issue that
   questions several of its established conclusions.},

Abstract = {Empirical evidence suggests that contemporary authoritarian regimes face
   several incentives to redistribute social policy concessions to their
   citizens. Yet autocracies differ extensively in their capacity to
   implement policy decisions. In this article, we identify three distinct
   but interrelated mechanisms through which state capacity determines a
   more equal provision of social benefits and services in healthcare and
   education sectors. Administrative capacity allows the regime to manage
   the implementation of social policy, extractive capacity ties in with
   more resources and information to be used for the provision of social
   benefits and services, and coercive capacity permits the state to
   effectively enforce policies. Using static and dynamic regression models
   for over 120 countries from 1960 to 2016, our findings show that state
   capacity enhances social equality in authoritarian contexts through
   these three interrelated mechanisms. Further analysis though suggests
   that the overall effect of state capacity dissipates in the long run.},

Abstract = {This research note introduces StatePol, a new and comprehensive database
   of German state politicians in parliaments and governments. StatePol
   includes sociodemographic characteristics such as age, sex, and
   birthplace, as well as career data such as memberships and offices in
   parliamentary party groups, committees, parliamentary presidencies, and
   government cabinets for every parliamentary and cabinet member on the
   German state level. The added value of the database lies in the fact
   that it offers highly fine-grained data capturing day-by-day changes
   within legislative periods. As a result, StatePol contains a total of
   22,379,186 daily observations of 6946 individual decision-makers in the
   German federal states, including information on their positions and
   mandates in legislative and executive realms. We illustrate potential
   applications of StatePol by exploring the descriptive representation of
   sex, age, and regional origin (eastern/western Germany) in the German
   states. We find that the proportion of women in the state parliaments
   has stagnated at around 30\% since the early 2000s, with considerable
   differences between parties and their parliamentary groups. We also
   observe a steady increase in the average age of the members of
   parliament, particularly among those of the Greens and the Left. While
   politicians of East German origin dominate in the parliaments and
   governments of the East German states, they are less represented in West
   German state parliaments and governments. In contrast, decision-makers
   born in West Germany consistently make up a substantial proportion of
   all state cabinet members. The database is publicly available, allowing
   researchers to comprehensively examine various questions on
   representation in the German context. This research note is accompanied
   by a homepage allowing users to explore the full potential of StatePol
   and to download the data.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the rural-urban divide has not only made its way back
   into political science, but has also been given an entirely new angle by
   investigating place of living as its own social identity. However,
   research is still in its early stages and studies so far focus on linear
   explanations of place-based resentment. This paper studies place in the
   light of social identity theory and investigates how place of living and
   place-based identity interact in shaping place-based resentment.
   Original survey data on around 4000 respondents from Switzerland from
   2022 with a novel measure of place-based identity and resentment is
   used. A distinction is made not only between rural and urban residents,
   but also between the suburbanites. Results show that rural residents
   hold the highest levels of identity and resentment, while suburban
   residents hold higher levels of resentment than urban ones do. Findings
   show that there is a moderating effect, whereby the rural-urban divide
   in resentment increases with place-based identity, while the
   suburban-urban gap diminishes with increasing place-based identity.
   These differences in place-based identity and resentment could explain
   the rural-urban divide in political attitudes and behavior.},

Abstract = {This study examines the triangular relationship between public debt,
   economic growth, and political risks, shedding light on the complex
   underlying dynamics of these factors. Using a Panel Vector
   Autoregressive (PVAR) model, we analyze this relationship from multiple
   angles across 117 countries. The study considers the impact of different
   political regimes and income levels, recognizing the importance of
   diverse economic and political contexts in shaping these interactions.
   The results reveal varied responses to public debt based on the
   political regime, highlighting that authoritarian systems, imperfect
   democracies, and full democracies exhibit distinct reactions.
   Additionally, the study underscores the influence of income levels on
   the relationship between public debt and economic growth. A balanced and
   comprehensive approach to public debt management is recommended, with an
   emphasis on political stability, transparency in political institutions,
   and economic diversification. Policymakers are advised to consider the
   duration of shocks to promote sustainable economic growth and fiscal
   health.},

Abstract = {As a former Rape Crisis and Women's Aid support worker turned feminist
   academic, I have had the privilege of working with some of the most
   inspirational and courageous women in Scotland. I see these women as the
   unsung heroines who are ultimately responsible for changing Scotland and
   making it internationally renowned for innovative and progressive
   practice in preventing Gender-Based Violence. For decades, women have
   worked as volunteers and/or paid staff to support survivors, run
   refuges, helplines, and campaigns whilst also training local
   authorities, police, and other agencies. Without them, we would have no
   women's support organisations, many more victims would remain in
   relationships with abusive men, and many more women would be dead at the
   hands of their partners or ex-partners. Yet, the organisations they run
   are desperately under-funded and many workers are on insecure contracts
   with low pay - a form of structural violence that reinforces gender
   inequality in Scotland. Equally important and unrecognised are the
   victim/survivors who have raised their voices to ask for help, to resist
   their abusers, and who risk everything to try to secure their survival.
   Without them we wouldn't know about the horrors many endure, and many
   others would not have been inspired to work tirelessly to change
   Scotland for the better. Collectively and individually, their
   achievements are significant. This article explores their resistance and
   resilience that has allowed Scotland to earn its stellar reputation.},

Abstract = {When studying the erosion of democratic institutions - such as elections
   - researchers often focus on elite co-optation or regime dynamics. Yet
   changes in political selection may also have long-term effects on the
   types of individuals seeking a political career, defining the dominant
   features of decision-makers down the road. I design a lab experiment to
   explore the effects of changes in political selection that accompanied
   authoritarian backsliding in Russia. Using a series of experiments, I
   show that creating an unfair playing field in elections and replacing
   elections with appointments for the local offices leads to
   self-selection of the risk-averse individuals into political careers.
   This happens because selection features like low costs of running (for
   regime candidates) and the absence of public evaluation for the
   appointees attract individuals who are more risk averse. This study
   demonstrates a causal mechanism connecting elements of authoritarian
   backsliding with citizen political ambition and contributes to our
   understanding of the long-term effects these changes may have on
   political participation, elite quality, and regime functioning.},

Abstract = {In many theories of electoral accountability, voters learn about an
   incumbent's quality by observing public goods outcomes. But empirical
   findings are mixed, suggesting that increasing the visibility of these
   outcomes only sometimes improves accountability. I reconcile these
   heterogeneous findings by highlighting bureaucrats' role in the
   production of public goods. In a simple model of electoral
   accountability involving a voter, a politician, and a bureaucrat, I show
   that accountability relationships yield distinct empirical implications
   at different levels of bureaucratic quality. To illustrate how this
   model rationalizes otherwise mixed or heterogeneous results, I develop a
   new research design-a theoretically structured meta-study-to synthesize
   existing findings. Meta-study evidence on the accountability of
   Brazilian mayors suggests that a common model of electoral
   accountability that allows for variation in bureaucratic quality
   predicts observed heterogeneity in politician and voter behavior and
   beliefs across multiple studies with distinct samples, treatments, and
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Starting from the most current developments in the legal and political
   processing of Donald J. Trump's (post)presidency, this contribution
   highlights the persisting challenges to the constitutional, social, and
   political stability of democracy in the United States (U.S.). In
   particular, it outlines several dimensions of an enabling environment in
   which Trump(ism) could thrive. A key feature of this is the thorough and
   ever-growing asymmetry that has come to characterize the partisan
   political context in the United States and that directs our attention to
   the conservative side of the political spectrum: the Republican Party as
   its major organizational embodiment, as well as broader trends of
   conservative (trans)formation, including those related to the
   electorate, policies, institutions, civil society, and the media. Thus,
   this contribution underlines the importance of the multiple and often
   longer-term influences, conflicts, institutions, and conditions
   conducive to current developments, including, in particular, the range
   of actors that have been relevant in shaping them. Asymmetric
   polarization, economic inequality, and nationalist and anti-government
   (authoritarian-populist) tendencies and movements are among the factors
   that together pose the most serious threat to liberal democracy in the
   United States-and in ``the West{''} more broadly. The introduction
   illustrates the importance of studying and reflecting upon the
   implications of the above trends, actors, and conditions for Germany and
   other European states, for transatlantic cooperation, and even for the
   global multilateral system as a whole. It concludes with an overview of
   the research articles in the special issue, outlining their individual
   as well as overlapping analytical interests and contributions.
   Vor dem Hintergrund der aktuellen Entwicklungen in der rechtlichen und
   politischen Aufarbeitung der (Nach-)Amtszeit von Donald J. Trump,
   skizziert der Einleitungsbeitrag die fortbestehenden Herausforderungen
   fur die politische, gesellschaftliche und verfassungsmassige Stabilitat
   der US-amerikanischen Demokratie. Insbesondere stellt er dabei die
   verschiedenen Ebenen eines forderlichen Kontextes dar, in dem
   Trump(ismus) besonders erfolgreich werden konnte. Ein zentrales Merkmal
   dieses Kontextes ist die tiefgreifende und stetig zunehmende Asymmetrie,
   die das politische Umfeld in den Vereinigten Staaten (USA) kennzeichnet
   und unsere Aufmerksamkeit auf den konservativen Bereich des Spektrums
   lenkt: auf die Republikanische Partei als seine wesentliche
   organisatorische Ausformung sowie auf weiterreichende Trends
   konservativer (Trans-)Formationen, die sich unter anderem in der
   Wahlerschaft, in Politiken, Institutionen, der Zivilgesellschaft und den
   Medien zeigen. Der Beitrag zoomt somit weg von Trump selbst, um die
   vielfaltigen und schon langer bestehenden Einflusse, Konflikte,
   Institutionen und Bedingungen sichtbar zu machen, die zu den aktuellen
   Entwicklungen beigetragen haben. Dies schliesst insbesondere auch die
   verschiedenen, an diesen Entwicklungen beteiligten Akteure und
   Akteursgruppen ein. Asymmetrische Polarisierung, okonomische
   Ungleichheit sowie nationalistische, regierungsfeindliche
   (autoritar-populistische) Tendenzen und Bewegungen stellen
   zusammengenommen die zentrale aktuelle Gefahr fur die liberale
   Demokratie in den USA und dem ,,Westen{''} insgesamt dar. Vor diesem
   Hintergrund veranschaulicht der Beitrag die Wichtigkeit weiterer Studien
   und Reflexionen zu den Implikationen der oben genannten Trends, Akteure
   und Bedingungen fur Deutschland und weitere europaische Staaten, fur die
   transatlantische Zusammenarbeit und das westlich gepragte globale
   multilaterale System als solches. Daraufhin schliesst die Einleitung mit
   einem uberblick uber die Forschungsartikel in diesem Sonderheft sowie
   uber ihre individuellen und gemeinsamen analytischen Interessen und
   Beitrage.},

Journal = {PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Volume = {54},
Number = {2},
Pages = {181-198},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As the vice presidency evolves over time, the way we assess vice
   presidents' activities and influence also needs to change. We must
   consider the type of partnership that the president and the vice
   president develop together, which determines not only the latter's
   involvement in the decision-making process but also the scope of his or
   her influence. Since partnerships can change from one term to another
   and according to the issues, they can help explain the fluctuations of
   vice presidents' influence within and between administrations, but they
   also enhance our comprehension of the evolution of executive power by
   emphasizing the dynamics of the connection between its principal
   components-the presidency and the vice presidency. This article
   introduces a new typology accounting for four different partnerships:
   communication, coordination, cooperation, and collaboration. This
   typology distinguishes between weak and strong partnerships, depending
   on the level of influence they allow the vice presidents to exert.
   Partnerships are defined by a series of criteria related to the
   selection of the running mate, the tasks of the vice president within
   the administration, and the quality of his or her relationship with the
   president.},

Abstract = {This article discusses a regionalization project, known as Minghetti's
   bill, that was presented to the Italian parliament just after the
   creation of the country in 1861, debated at length, and finally
   rejected. The bill was the most advanced point reached on the
   decentralization front in Italy before the Second World War. Minghetti's
   bill is the first example of a regional process ever brought to
   parliamentary discussion. It was also a precursor of other
   regionalization schemes, such as the creation of French regions in 1972.},

Abstract = {Do citizens and non-citizens perceive themselves as more politically
   influential in contexts with more immigrant-inclusive local
   enfranchisement policies? Despite long-standing debates about the
   unequal responsiveness in the political systems of many advanced
   democracies, we still know little about whether targeted public policies
   at the local level can alter perceptions of political representation
   among residents. Importantly, little attention has been paid to the
   potential intended and unintended consequences of local electoral
   policies on external efficacy and research designs that include
   non-citizen residents. In this paper, we argue and test whether local
   alien enfranchisement raises external efficacy among non-citizens as a
   highly effective marker of immigrant inclusivity. Next, considering the
   potential spill-over effects of alien enfranchisement on citizens, we
   examine whether such electoral expansion is associated with a perceived
   increase in competition for political influence and a subsequent decline
   in citizens' external efficacy. Empirically, we focus on the Swiss case
   and exploit local electoral institutions' sub-national and temporal
   variation using longitudinal data from the Swiss Household Panel from
   1999 to 2014. The paper adds to earlier work by proposing local policy
   context regarding non-citizen enfranchisement as one of the predictors
   of external efficacy on the resident population. Our findings suggest
   that perceived political influence among non-citizens is higher in
   municipalities with inclusive enfranchisement. We find no evidence for
   citizens experiencing lower external efficacy when voting rights are
   extended, making alien enfranchisement potentially a valuable tool to
   improve political integration among immigrants in today's diverse
   democracies.},

Abstract = {Multiple well-known democracy-rating projects-including Freedom House,
   Polity, and Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem)-have identified apparent
   global regression in recent years. These measures rely on partly
   subjective indicators, which-in principle-could suffer from rater bias.
   For instance, Little and Meng (2023) argue that shared beliefs driven by
   the current zeitgeist could lead to shared biases that produce the
   appearance of democratic backsliding in subjectively coded measures. To
   assess this argument and the strength of the evidence for global
   democratic backsliding, we propose an observable-to-subjective score
   mapping (OSM) methodology that uses only easily observable features of
   democracy to predict existing indices of democracy. Applying this
   methodology to three prominent democracy indices, we find evidence of
   backsliding-but beginning later and not as pronounced as suggested by
   some of the original indices. Our approach suggests that the Freedom
   House measure particularly does not track with the recent patterns in
   observable indicators and that there has been a stasis or-at most-a
   modest decline in the average level of democracy.},

Abstract = {The `High Representative' speaks on behalf of the European Union in
   international organizations since 2010. The motivation for this reform
   has been to strengthen the European Union's foreign policy
   representation. It can be expected that this empowerment of the High
   Representative has affected the content of official European Union
   speeches held at the United Nations. Did the reform lead to a more
   coherent and cohesive representation of European Union foreign policy at
   the United Nations? To answer this question, I analyze the content of
   all speeches held on behalf of the European Union in the United Nations
   General Assembly between 1993 and 2021. I find that European Union
   foreign policy priorities are more coherently and cohesively represented
   since the Lisbon reforms took effect. I argue that the empowerment of
   the `High Representatives' and their diplomats caused this effect.
   Today, European Union representatives are less likely to follow global
   trends but set their own thematic priorities by focusing on the areas of

Abstract = {In the past three years, the African continent has experienced a notable
   upswing in and Mali. The Greater Sahel Region has emerged as a global
   focal point of concern, grappling with issues of inadequate governance,
   extremism, and violence. Despite the efforts of regional bodies such as
   ECOWAS, military takeovers persist, posing challenges to democratic
   processes and heightening the threat of increased terrorism. Since 2020,
   Niger, a landlocked nation that was once a French colony, has faced its
   13th coup attempt, contributing to increased instability in West and
   Central Africa. Despite robust regional opposition, the junta in Niger
   persists in power, highlighting the difficulties of overturning a coup.
   This situation carries geopolitical implications, risking U.S. security
   assistance to Niger and prompting neighbouring countries to strengthen
   ties with Russia post-coups. The Secretary of State cautions about
   potential consequences, underscoring the region's reputation as the
   `coup capital of the world'. The July 2023 successful coup in Niger not
   only jeopardises the country's progress under civilian leaders but also
   heightens the risks of insecurity, economic crises, and political
   instability. The Sahel, known as a hub of terrorism, faces increased
   concerns as Niger's strategic importance in countering extremism
   diminishes due to the coup. This event jeopardises Niger's standing as a
   democratic stronghold and a deterrent against jihad and Russian
   influence in the region, accentuating the broader challenge of
   stabilising the Sahel amid intricate socio-political and security
   issues. This article aims to illuminate the root causes and consequences
   of conflict and political instability in the region. Specifically, it
   seeks to address fundamental questions such as the factors leading to
   the current political instability and the repercussions of this conflict
   for Niger and the broader Sahel region. The answers to these questions
   offer insights into resolving the present challenge.},

Abstract = {The lead up to the May 2020 elections in Suriname, a Dutch-speaking
   country in the Caribbean with a culturally diverse population of 550,000
   people, was beset with several difficulties including the effects of the
   coronavirus pandemic. Although Suriname has had seventeen universal
   suffrage elections since 1949, this election cycle was notable for the
   integral role of social media in political campaigning. Political
   parties adapted and implemented online campaign strategies with
   extensive politicking through platforms on issues such as corruption,
   economic crisis and ethnic political mobilization. Online campaign
   strategy raises questions about whether changes in political
   communication change the shape and nature of political struggle in a
   country characterized by consociational democracy and electoral
   instability. This article addresses these questions, with the broader
   goal of understanding political power struggles from a new lens that
   draws on e-politics and Gramsci's classical approaches. Combined with
   social media analyses, this article highlights how the ruling political
   party, the NDP, seeks to maintain its power and how the main opposition
   party, the VHP, challenges it. It also examines whether social media
   influenced the nature of political party interaction, the construction
   of networks and allies, the political framing of ethnicity or the
   formation of online public opinion.},

   DURING THE WAR},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRANSFORMATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Russia's military aggression has intensified the issue of political
   corruption in Ukraine as new threats emerge. Ignoring this issue in the
   short term could significantly destabilize the system of state
   governance and, in turn, jeopardize Ukraine's existence as an
   independent and democratic state. This study examines changes in the
   mechanisms for detecting and preventing political corruption in Ukraine
   under the full-scale Russian invasion, particularly in areas such as
   state funding of political parties, transparency of party finances, and
   officials' asset declarations. Despite security concerns, public
   attention to political corruption in Ukraine is growing. The absence of
   a systematic approach characterizes Ukraine's current political
   corruption prevention stage. Despite the war, an anti-corruption
   infrastructure has been established and is operational, with ongoing
   optimization of the relevant legal framework. On the other hand,
   informal practices that exhibit evident characteristics of political

Abstract = {Recent research has shown a trend towards more participatory nomination
   procedures in new as well as more established parties. However, in
   Slovakia most politically relevant parties have equally centralised,
   leadership-dominated, and exclusive candidate selection modes. In the
   first part of the article I draw on the elite literature to investigate
   cross-party variation in the social bias of parliamentary elites since
   2006. Using the 2023 election as a point of departure, I go on to assess
   how representative MPs are of their own voters, and why social bias
   varies across parties despite their similar selection modes. The
   analysis demonstrates that the impact of the selection mode as well as
   of voter preferences is contingent on the nomination practices of the
   individual parties. I found strong elements of self-selection in nearly
   all parties: the members of the presidium nominated themselves, and the
   composition of the parliamentary elites thus to a considerable extent
   reflects who the presidium members are. The influence of the voters is
   limited, because they tend to confirm the priorities of the
   selectorates; however, in the case of the four smallest parties in 2023,
   preference voting to some extent mitigated the effect of self-selection.
   The main drivers of preference voting were the idiosyncratic nomination
   practice of Ordinary People, and the presence of organised groups and
   parties on the list (informal alliances).},

Abstract = {Wars can produce drastic changes in the attitudes and behavior of the
   citizens of the countries involved in the fighting. Yet such conflicts
   also have important security and economic implications for uninvolved,
   third-party states. How do the wars of others shape domestic public
   attitudes? We explore this question by analyzing the effect of the
   February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine on Spanish nationalism.
   Exploiting a natural experiment in Spain, we show that the Russian
   invasion caused a general increase in the salience of Spanish national
   identification, but not at the expense of regional or substate national
   identities. We also find an activation effect on electoral participation
   and increased support for taxation. Our study illuminates pathways
   through which international conflicts can affect domestic politics in
   third-party states.},

   University and the Institute of China and Modern Asia of the Russian
   Academy of Sciences, united within the framework of the ``Moscow Project
   for the Study of Chinese Political Culture{''}, to investigate the
   political culture of modern China through the monitoring of social
   networks. The authors analyze the existing ideas about political culture
   in the Chinese academic discourse, identify problems in studying the
   political views of Chinese citizens by traditional sociological methods
   (surveys, questionnaires). They further explain the relevance of using
   social network analysis in modern studies of Chinese society, and also
   describe the methodology they developed for studying social networks
   using sentiment analysis. The article lays the theoretical and
   methodological basis for further research on modern Chinese society
   based on an array of data from Chinese social networks.},

Title = {Politics on the square. Sudanese exiles facing asylum government in
   Cairo},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2024},
Number = {145},
Abstract = {In Egypt, as in many other countries of the world, the role of the
   United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the daily life
   of refugees is central as evidenced by their regular visits. However,
   the offices of the organization and its partners are secured in a way
   that puts them at a distance and reduces the possibilities of
   interaction. The counter, theoretically the central place for these
   administrative encounters, is replaced by the square, a forecourt space
   located in front of the organization's buildings, which has become
   almost inaccessible, where the exiles are confined. The square becomes a
   place where people socialize and learn from each other's experiences,
   without the presence of administrative agents. These shared experiences
   encourage the recognition of structural flaws in the functioning of the
   government of asylum, and the emergence of a political critique that
   sometimes translates into occupations or demonstrations in the square.
   By adopting a theoretical framework that combines the study of
   international humanitarian policy from below and the relationship of
   subaltern politics, this article shows that the square, produced by
   these devices of distancing and depoliticization, actually induces an
   unexpected politicization of the experiences of exile.},

Title = {Territorial Configurations of School-To-Work Outcomes in Europe},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Comparative research on school -to -work transitions mainly focused on
   country differences, examining the variation in institutional design and
   its impact on shaping youth labour market outcomes. The field has been
   dominated by a sort of methodological nationalism assuming nation states
   as homogeneous objects of comparison, while the territorial variations
   in youth transitions among sub -national territories have been less
   explored, notwithstanding their potential impact on life chances. In
   this article, we look at the outcomes of transitions in EU regions,
   comparing regional configurations of school -to -work transitions and
   their change over time. Is it possible to identify differences among
   groups of regions? To what extent do these patterns change over time? In
   order to answer these questions, we construct and analyse a longitudinal
   and systematic set of indicators that combine regional aggregated
   outcomes of transitions from education to work and regional contextual
   traits at the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics level 2
   for the period 2007-2019. We perform two cluster analyses to describe
   regional differences and trends over time. The findings provide novel
   insights into the characteristics and patterns of an unequal geography
   of youth opportunities in Europe.},

Abstract = {The paper identifies and analyzes the new forms of action of the Courts
   of Auditors of Brazil based on the rereading of its competence matrix.
   In other words, the study projects an innovative agenda of inspection
   for each of the stages of the budgetary cycle using a systematic
   interpretation of the constitutional and legal functions of the
   brazilian external control system, the recent experience of the Federal
   Audit Court and the current management and technological paradigms in
   progress in the public sector. The research, of descriptive, exploratory
   and argumentative character, follows a qualitative approach and uses the
   bibliographic and documental review as a research technique. It has been
   shown that the Courts of Auditors of Brazil system, which has a
   constitutional mandate to exercise the accounting, financial, budgetary,
   operational and patrimonial supervision of the federative entity under
   its jurisdiction, as expressed in article 70, caput of the Federal
   Constitution, has gaps in its performance that have not yet been fully
   explored. In terms of expected institutional and practical results, the
   control mechanisms indicated in the research contribute to the expansion
   and improvement of the supervisory scope of the Audit Courts of the
   country, as instruments of horizontal accountability, and enable
   effective delivery of services.},

Title = {HYBRID WARFARE IN THE CONTEXT OF CLAUSEWITZ'S BOOK ON WAR AND THE THEORY
   OF STRATEGY},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Hybrid warfare is a concept discussed by the security community and has
   been used to describe the rivalry between powers for the past three
   decades. In the form of hybrid security threats, the concept has
   influenced the shape of NATO and EU strategic documents. Hybrid warfare
   has inspired many scholarly essays, but this essay is notable for
   analyzing the concept of hybrid warfare in the context of Clausewitz's
   ideas and strategy theory. In fact, Clausewitz's book `On War',
   according to experts, retains its validity for today's conflicts, which
   are also fought using civil wars and terrorism, by non-state actors.
   Clausewitz's central idea that war is the continuation of politics by
   other means does not apply only to the state, but includes all actors
   involved in war conflicts. Moreover, the concept of hybrid warfare is
   analysed and critiqued from the perspective of strategy theory, which
   assumes that all wars throughout history have shared certain common
   attributes. These attributes are clarified in the essay, which also
   presents the specifics of hybrid warfare that correspond to modern
   warfare in the 21st century, especially in terms of information and
   cyber warfare.},

Title = {Moral Panic and Repression: the contentious politics of anti-Sem-itism
   in Germany},
Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {276-349},
Abstract = {Moral panics can be used as a mechanism of repression of political and
   social protests through the definition of activists as challenging the
   core values of a society. Taking Germany as a critical case, the article
   analyses a number of aggressive campaigns mounted by the media and
   politicians against progressive artists and intellectuals, most of whom
   are from the global South, but which also includes Jewish people
   critical of Israeli actions, who have been accused of violating the
   German narrative in what has been defined as a ``war{''} against
   anti-Semitism. After an introduction to the repression of
   pro-Palestinian protests, I will begin by providing a methodological
   note, before going on to present the conceptualization of a moral panic
   and locate its mechanisms within an analysis of the repression of social
   movements. I will then present some cases that can be read through the
   sociological category of a moral panic, singling out the panic
   entrepreneurs and their forms of intervention as well as the outcomes of
   their actions. What this further analysis adds to the literature is a
   reflection on the contextual conditions for the development of such
   moral panic in a specific mass-media, regulatory and political context.
   I will then suggest that in the German case in particular the contextual
   conditions for the spread of the moral panic are related to: a) a
   bureaucratization of anti-Semitism policies, with the creation of a
   specialized bureaucracy; the adoption of a semi-legal definition of
   anti-Semitism through the development of an especially vague and blurred
   definition of anti-Semitism; and the assimilation of anti-Zionist
   peaceful forms of protests (such as BDS) as anti-Semitic; b) the
   development of political and cultural opportunities around the
   definition of the security of Israel as a `` raison d'\& Eacute;tat{''}
   `` and a convergence on a selective, formalized official memory; and c)
   the alignment of the majority of civil society and mass-media around an
   official narrative.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the role of right-wing think tanks in the
   ideological hybridization of the conservative field, with a particular
   focus on the Burke Foundation, an American think tank, in shaping a
   ``national-conservative{''} project. Drawing on Michael Freeden's
   morphological approach, this paper assumes the hypothesis that
   ideologies are constantly evolving and argues that this is particularly
   true in the current context. The neo-conservatism of the Republican
   Party has been destabilized by the transformation of the American
   neo-liberal order following the 2007/2008 financial crisis. Gary Gerstle
   (2022) explicitly refers to this as a crisis of the American model of
   neo-liberalism. Meanwhile, the rise of the first Trump presidency laid
   the groundwork for Reagan-era neo-conservatism to be grafted onto an
   ethno-nationalist ideology. Secondly, it will be argued that the revival
   of ideologies brings to life a revival of intellectuals as
   ``ideology-enablers{''}. Finally, the strengthening of
   national-conservatism, meant as a bridge between the ``old
   conservatism{''} and the new illiberal nationalism that emerged in the
   populist decade, will be discussed. For this purpose, an overview will
   be provided of the hybrid ideological Pantheon of a think tank like the
   Burke Foundation.},

   External Policy?},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {The EU's Eastern enlargement in 2004 was marked by the entry of mostly
   smaller states, whose ability to shape the external direction of the EU
   was questioned. However, the EU's response to the war in Ukraine has
   shown how important the Eastern dimension of external policy is for the
   EU and that this Easternisation of the EU has occurred precisely in the
   wake of the 2004 enlargement. This is due to the fact that these states
   have been able to push their own narratives in the discourse on the EU's
   Eastern direction, particularly in the case of the Eastern Partnership.
   This article analyses the discourse of Central and Eastern European
   states regarding the Eastern partnership, specifically the narratives of
   the official documents of three Baltic and four Visegrad group countries
   in the 2009-2022 period. The analysis made it possible to identify
   narrative structures and showed that the narratives are relatively
   similar in the selected countries. Despite the lack of cooperation
   between the two groups and the West's neglect of the Eastern Partnership
   policy, they were able to individually strengthen their position in the
   EU and maintain the discussion about the Eastern Partnership at the EU
   level as a result.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the positionings and discursive struggles
   between the key political actors around the expropriation project of
   Vicentin conglomerate, during the government of Alberto Fern \&
   aacute;ndez. As a result of the research work, we found an intense
   hegemonic struggle around the project. On the one hand, we found a
   package of discourses that expressed itself in favor of the measure and
   was condensed in the defense of food sovereignty, the rescue of a
   strategic company to control prices in the domestic market, regulate the
   foreign exchange and avoid abrupt devaluations, preserve jobs and
   guarantee payment to their creditors. In addition, it affirmed that it
   was an exceptional measure, stressed that Vicentin was bankrupt and
   accused of fraudulent maneuvers. On the other, we found a discursive
   package contrary to the project, which invoked as arguments the
   unconstitutionality of the measure and its negative effects on legal
   certainty and confidence necessary to attract investment. In addition,
   it maintained that all Argentines were going to take over the debt of a
   private company, classified the defense of food sovereignty as an
   `excuse' or considered that Argentina was on the way to a `chavista'
   model. Finally, we address the hegemonic impact at the institutional and
   social level, which generated social protests and a judicialization of
   politics and ended in the blocking of the project.},

Abstract = {The article presents partial results of a research that aims to
   understand the impacts of the Covid-19 Pandemic and Recommendation 62 of
   the National Council of Justice on the prison system. To this end,
   quantitative and qualitative data on habeas corpus filed at the Mato
   Grosso do Sul Court of Justice in the period from 2020 to 2022 were
   analyzed. Initially, the total number of habeas corpus filed throughout
   the State before and during the Pandemic was collected to, then, collect
   data relating to habeas corpus arising only from the District of Campo
   Grande and for the crimes of drug trafficking, robbery, theft and
   homicides. Based on this last survey and from reading the complete
   content of the judgments, several habeas corpus variables were raised
   that made direct mention of Recommendation 62, totaling 390 habeas
   corpus that also constituted the basis for the qualitative analysis. In
   this article, we will present the results of the quantitative analysis
   and, also, a brief qualitative analysis of two habeas corpus that,
   although similar, had different outcomes, demonstrating the effects of
   the ``free motivated conviction{''} on the inequality of judicial
   decisions.},

Abstract = {Russia's war against Ukraine has caused political collateral damage. One
   victim is the OSCE. It has lost its ability to act. Moscow uses the OSCE
   as a platform for propaganda and uses the principle of unanimity to
   paralyse it. Moscow is blocking the budget, personnel decisions, and
   events, such as the Human Dimension Implementation Meeting. The states
   that are interested in a functioning OSCE and support Ukraine are forced
   to balance between confrontation and cooperation. They must criticise
   Russia for the war and the violation of OSCE principles, circumvent
   Russia's blockade through improvisation, but also be prepared to make
   common decisions with Russia.},

   Anticolonial Demonumentalizations},
Journal = {POLITOLOGIJA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {114},
Number = {2},
Pages = {55-80},
Abstract = {This article reflects upon objects and actions of counter-memory
   activism in Brazil in the wake of anticolonial demonumentalizations.
   Initially, it focuses on statues symbolizing colonial and traumatic
   pasts, notably the Borba Gato statue in S \& atilde;o Paulo, dedicated
   to a colonial explorer. The monument was set ablaze in July 2021,
   sparking widespread debate. The discussion deepens with the
   commemoration of Marielle Franco, a councilwoman and human rights
   advocate who was murdered in 2018. The interplay between memory
   initiatives and political activism is examined, with tributes analyzed
   as collective authorship by black and feminist movements. Ethnographic
   data from Rio de Janeiro and digital environments inform this analysis.
   Events related to monuments and other objects are viewed as political
   rituals in the struggle against forgetting. Statues, street signs,
   graffiti, posters, and other forms of counter-memory supports are
   identified as focal points for understanding the relationship between
   objects, artistic-political practices, and public life.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE INVESTIGACIONES POLITICAS Y SOCIOLOGICAS},

Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {These pages seek to establish a possible relationship between attitudes
   towards cannabis and ideology. We start from the idea that, while
   traditionally pro or con tendencies were identified with certain social
   groups and ideological positions, the current diversity of individual
   narratives and social complexity may have blurred this association.
   There is a multiplicity of social factors that influence opinions about
   cannabis. In this paper we focus on the relationship between ideology
   and attitude towards the legalization of cannabis sale in Spain, to find
   out if both variables condition each other or are independent. To do so,
   we have used CIS study 3318, the barometer conducted for April 2021,
   which incorporates data on these two questions. We extract information
   on tests of independence, strengths and the nature of the association,
   in order to understand the relationships between the two. The results
   obtained show that there is an association between respondents' ideology
   and attitudes towards the legalization of marijuana, both for sale and
   for medicinal use.},

   President Donald Trump's political agenda: Muslims, immigrants and

   relevant sections of Trump's ideology and policy in the field of

   a section is dedicated to the difficult framing of Trump in political
   theories. I am inclined to consider Trump an ultraconservative
   nationalist and populist. With respect to the three fields of
   international relations indicated, the following structure is followed:
   a) Facts, b) Justification of President Trump and c) Criticism of the

   Experiment},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {307-330},
Abstract = {Although an extensive experimental literature has tested a wide array of
   voter mobilization tactics, billboard advertisements have seldom been
   evaluated, and studies to date have been limited to a small number of
   sites. This essay reports results from a nationwide experiment conducted
   during the 2020 general election in the United States. Experimental
   sites were ethnically diverse locations in metro areas, including both
   presidential battlegrounds as well as places with no closely contested
   races. A total of 298 billboards were randomly assigned to treatment or
   control in 155 geographic clusters. Exposure to billboards by
   residential location is modelled using cell phone usage patterns.
   Turnout is measured using public records for residents living at various
   distances from randomly assigned billboards. Using a variety of
   estimation approaches, we obtain point estimates that are close to zero,
   with hints of stronger effects among those who reside near treated
   billboards. On the whole, it appears that signage does little to raise
   turnout in high-salience elections.},

Abstract = {In majoritarian legislatures, minority parties cannot directly influence
   policymaking. However, they may serve as whistleblowers against the
   majority parties' harmful policymaking. This study aims to explore
   whether a minority party's monitoring mitigates a political agency
   problem in a majoritarian legislature. For this purpose, we construct a
   two-period election model in which voters face information asymmetries
   regarding each party's type and the state of the world. After the
   majority party proposes a bill, the minority party votes for or against
   the proposed bill, which is a cheap-talk message. We show that the role
   of monitoring by the minority party is limited, even if we allow the
   possibility that the party is the truth-telling type. Under a weak
   condition, its opposition is informative, but does not change the
   electorate's voting behaviors. Consequently, any equilibrium outcomes
   attained in the game with monitoring are attainable in the game without
   monitoring. This implies that monitoring by the minority party does not
   influence electoral accountability. This irrelevance of monitoring is
   resolved when the minority party can delay legislation through
   obstruction.},

Abstract = {The article examines two different leftist, Antifa actors in Cyprus, a
   political party and a societal group (i.e., an organized football fan
   group), in relation to two issues. First, we scrutinize their action
   repertoire in order to identify the type of activities they embrace to
   tackle the fascist/far-right threat and activity. Second, we study their
   perceptions regarding the extent of the fascist threat and the use of
   violence in their treatment of far-right organizations and activists.
   The article seeks to understand how antifascists in Cyprus understand
   resistance against far-right organizations, and violence in particular
   as one manifestation of this resistance. The methodology relied on
   fieldwork that combines two different methods: analysis of social media
   posts over a span of 11 years (2010-2021) and selected interviews with
   activists and cadres from the two actors. We find that they share
   similar perceptions about the extent and the nature of the fascist
   threat in Cyprus. They also share similarities with regard to the
   overall toolkit they use to deal with the far-right. However, they
   deviate significantly in the way they perceive the use of violence
   against fascists.},

Title = {Electoral Participation of Non-National EU Citizens in France: The Case
   of the Nord},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Since the 1993 Maastricht Treaty, EU citizens have the right to vote in
   European and local elections in the member state they reside in. In
   France, only about a quarter do so. Our article considers what factors
   explain the registration and participation of non -national citizens for
   the French Department of the Nord where around 35,000 non-French
   European citizens of voting age are living. Among them, 11,638 are
   registered to vote in the French municipal elections. Following the 2020
   municipal elections, we have consulted the electoral rolls in each of
   the 648 communes to know who actually cast a vote. Based on detailed
   census data on each EU nationality and on other information contained on
   the electoral lists and rolls (age, gender, place of birth, etc.) and
   also contextual variables, this article seeks to identify the main
   factors associated with registering in the first instance and turning
   out to vote in the second. Our results confirm wide variation in
   registration and voting rates according to nationality. They also show
   that beyond voters' nationality and the ``usual suspects{''} of
   electoral participation, contextual factors are important predictors.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Why are there so few working-class women in politics? While white-collar
   representatives dominate legislatures in general, the deficit of
   working-class members is particularly pronounced among female
   politicians. To answer this question, this study examines the influence
   of class and gender in voter evaluation. Through the cross-country
   comparison of conjoint experiments in the U.S. and the U.K., we find
   that working-class backgrounds disadvantage women candidates in a way
   that they do not disadvantage their male counterparts. Voters tend to
   prefer white-collar candidates to working-class politicians. Such a
   negative effect of working-class backgrounds is particularly evident for
   female candidates because the negative traits associated with the lower
   economic class, such as incompetence and lack of ambition, exacerbate
   voters' questions about female candidates' qualifications for political
   leadership. By contrast, for male candidates, whose qualifications are
   rarely questioned based on their gender, candidates' working-class
   background has a less negative impact.},

Title = {The Conditionality of Political Short-Termism: A Review of Empirical and
   Experimental Studies},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Political short-termism prioritizes short-term net policy benefits over
   long-term benefits and thus can hinder policy investments that impose
   short-term costs to society to address long-term policy challenges. This
   literature review explores when political short-termism can be driven
   and mitigated in a democratic system by reviewing empirical and
   experimental studies and identifying the various factors that can
   influence policy investments: elections, economic conditions,
   power-sharing arrangements, partisanship, the presence of compensation
   schemes, and media coverage among politicians; discounts of future
   policy benefits, policy trade-offs, political ideology, and
   socioeconomic and demographic factors among voters; and compliance
   costs, power-sharing arrangements, compensations, and long-term
   political signaling from governments among special interest groups.
   Finally, I discuss the findings and provide suggestions for future
   research.},

   sustainable development building},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {128},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {This research aims to analyze the evolution of the concept of
   sustainable development as a human right from its declaration in 1986 to
   its institutionalization in the United Nations 2030 Agenda through an
   archaeological reconstruction. The study examines the affirmation of
   development as a human right in various sources of international law and
   recovers the most significant moments of the emergence of the new
   paradigm of development in the late 20th century. The methodological
   approach is qualitative, using the inductive method. The research
   technique adopted is bibliographic, with an analysis of documentary
   sources. The results indicate a marked recent alteration of the concept
   of development, now termed multidimensional sustainable development,
   already incorporated into United Nations international instruments. The
   research concludes that the United Nations 2030 Agenda represents an
   ambitious civilizational project that incorporates this new formulation
   of development, transitioning across various areas of knowledge, and
   expanding the foundations of this human right. The contributions of this
   research include a thorough analysis of the evolution of the concept of
   sustainable development as a human right and its implications for the
   fields of international law and development.},

Title = {Global Fragmentation and Collective Security Instruments: Weakening the
   Liberal International Order From Within},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Collective instruments, such as UN peacekeeping or mediation, are a lens
   through which we can examine broader normative fault lines in the
   international order. They hold both practical and symbolic value. In the
   post -Cold War moment, these instruments started reflecting liberal
   values. They became concerned with balancing the rights of individuals
   and state sovereignty. These advances around ``human protection{''} are
   now in question, with contestation perceived as emerging from non
   -Western powers. I contribute to the debates on the ``pragmatic turn{''}
   within collective responses but contend that while the focus in current
   debates about the normative shift has become global fragmentation, the
   momentum for the de -prioritization of human protection within
   collective instruments comes from within the liberal order itself. Human
   protection is now a broadly shared and firmly entrenched norm, but to
   shield the norm from abuse, the collective international community
   progressively restricted any use of force to advance the norm within the
   instrument of UN peacekeeping. The co-optation of UN peacekeeping into
   counter -terrorism efforts and the introduction of stabilization
   mandates undermined the principled nature and moral authority of the
   instrument of peacekeeping itself. This, in turn, compromised the
   implementation of human protection. This development is now accelerated
   and exposed due to global fragmentation, influencing not just
   peacekeeping but also other adjacent activities, such as mediation.},

Abstract = {Why have the people running for Congress become more ideologically
   extreme over time, causing Congress to polarize? In this paper, we study
   how the pool of state legislators shapes the ideological distribution of
   congressional candidates. We geographically match state legislators to
   the US House districts that they could plausibly seek to represent.
   Although the national pool of state legislators has polarized over time,
   we find no evidence that they have polarized more where opportunities to
   win House seats are higher, or that more-extreme state legislators have
   become more likely to run for Congress relative to other state
   legislators in the same congressional districts. We conclude that the
   nationwide polarization of state legislators is particularly important
   in explaining the polarization of congressional candidates. The results
   emphasize the need to understand ideological selection into running for
   lower-level political offices in order to understand congressional
   polarization.},

Abstract = {This article delves into the work of American ethnomusicologist Alan
   Lomax during his expedition to Italy in the 1950s to document
   traditional music in collaboration with Diego Carpitella. Lomax's
   Italian adventure, marked by extensive collection of recordings and
   photographs, takes place within a particular intellectual climate. Lomax
   is deeply influenced by the works of Ernesto De Martino, Carlo Levi's
   Cristo si \& egrave; fermato a Eboli, and his meeting with Alberto
   Moravia. Through a meticulous analysis of Lomax's radio programmes for
   the BBC and his theoretical writings, the article explores his
   conception of folk music in Southern Italy. According to Lomax, this
   music holds unsuspected richness and authenticity. The musical
   characteristics of Southern songs sharply contrast with those of the
   North and reflect the harsh living conditions and archaic customs of the
   Mezzogiorno. In this perspective, the shrill and mournful voices of
   women translate, from cradle to grave, the drama of a South that
   deserves to be rediscovered and preserved.},

Title = {OIKOPHOBIA AND THE CRISIS OF MODERN WESTERN CIVILIZATION},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {3},
Pages = {37-49},
Abstract = {The subject of this article is the phenomenon of oikophobia, which in
   recent decades has attracted the attention of philosophers, political
   scientists, sociologists and psychologists who tend to interpret it as
   the origin of many crisis phenomena affecting the modern Western
   civilization. The term has been used in political contexts to refer
   critically to political ideologies that are perceived as responsible for
   repudiating one's own culture, history, traditions and laud others. The
   simplest way of defining oikophobia is as the opposite extreme of
   xenophobia. As xenophobia means the fear or hatred of strangers or
   foreigners, reversely oikophobia means the fear or hatred of home or
   one's own society or civilization, oikos being the ancient Greek word
   for home, house, household. The article reveals the essence and content,
   characteristic manifestations of oikophobia in its narrow and broad
   meanings, the historical, cultural and intellectual background and
   sources of its origin and development. The author identifies signs of
   oikophobia in a number of key political, philosophical and ideological
   paradigms and concepts. Based on our findings, we suggest that various
   manifestations of oikophobia, especially those that may provide the
   ideological basis for mass protest movements, pose a serious challenge
   to public policy and government institutions not only in Western
   countries, but also in Russia. Government bodies and non-governmental
   organizations involved in the process of policy formulation in the
   spheres of security, information and education should pay attention to
   the threats and challenges that government institutions in the USA,
   Great Britain and a number of other Western countries have already dealt
   with. In our opinion, one of the most relevant areas of interaction
   between the Russian government and civil society in the field of
   countering the manifestations of oikophobia should be formulating
   general criteria for identifying Russophobia, which could be applied not
   only in the field of scientific research and educational practices, but
   also in the field of lawmaking and law enforcement.},

Abstract = {Western democracies rather than being consolidated are increasingly
   shattered by new value and identitarian conflicts. Instead of a widening
   consensus about core democratic values, we observe the intensification
   of value polarisation. Even European integration, which was meant to
   promote its core foundational principles to be embraced by member states
   and citizens across the European social and political space, continues,
   as shown by numerous opinion polls, to be divided by value clashes. In
   light of these contrasting experiences, I ask: How can we explain the
   new salience of value conflicts in democracy despite the postulated end
   of ideologies? What, if anything distinguishes value conflicts from old
   ideological polarisations? Drawing on empirical examples of social media
   polarisations, I will argue that such new value conflicts between
   polarised groups (e.g. liberals against anti-liberals) are to be
   understood as a continuation and not a discontinuation of old
   ideological divides. As such, they should be interpreted either as
   disruptions of existing democracy or as departure towards novel forms of
   democratic government and not as the heralds of a new age of post-
   democracy and post-ideology.},

Title = {PROJECT EU-AFRICA: CHANGES OF STRATEGY IN COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to identify changes in the priorities of the
   EU's African strategy, seeking to maintain its position on the continent
   in light of competition from such actors as the United States and China,
   as well as to trace the evolution of the relations formats and influence
   of integration processes on the EU-Africa relations model. The authors
   use complex interdisciplinary approach, narrative methods and
   comparative analysis to determine new trends in EU cooperation with
   African countries including transition to multilateralism and
   regionalization; applying elements of integration and external
   Europeanization as convergence and incorporation of procedures,
   practices and norms in cooperation projects in Africa, using ``soft
   power{''} instruments; policy of ``equal partnership{''} and
   politicization of EU-Africa relations. However, the effectiveness of
   Europeanization as a replication of the European value system and
   democratic transition in African countries with other civilizational
   norms is very limited, so EU countries follow institutional logic in
   their relations with them. The authors underscore that the process of
   regional integration in Africa is one of the results of deepening
   cooperative interactions against the backdrop of its continuing
   asymmetry, also being an important difference of EU-Africa project from
   other cooperative models. Asymmetry manifests in economic relations,
   especially trade agreements, recognition of equal partnership, different
   positions in new world order, intra-country development differences and
   financial and labor force abilities of African countries. Equally
   relevant is the analysis of EU competition with the USA and China in
   Africa, identifying its specific traits in cooperation with the
   continent, and future prospects of the EU cooperation with African
   countries under the new realities and possible shortcomings of a new
   EU-Africa project.},

   participation: A serial multiple mediation analysis in Ecuador},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {This research explores the attitudinal and cognitive mediators of the
   relationship between political group membership and different modes of
   offline political participation. Specifically, this paper examines the
   mediating role of political interest, political knowledge, internal
   political efficacy, and subjective norms. For comparative purposes, the
   analysis considers membership in two types of political groups:
   political parties and social movements. The empirical study was based on
   a sample of 824 adults from Quito-Ecuador. The data were analyzed using
   serial multiple mediator models. The results indicate that: a) party
   membership mainly favors conventional participation, while belonging to
   social movements mobilizes protest participation more strongly. b) for
   the two types of membership, the hypothesized mediators were
   significant, explaining mostly the relationship with conventional
   participation; and c) political interest acts as the most relevant
   mediator. The final section discusses the findings of the study,
   including implications, limitations and recommendations for future
   research.},

Abstract = {Researchers in `hard' science disciplines are exploring the
   transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for advancing
   research in their fields. Their colleagues in `soft' science, however,
   have produced thus far a limited number of articles on this subject.
   This paper addresses this gap. Our main hypothesis is that existing
   Artificial Intelligence Large Language Models (LLMs) can closely align
   with human expert assessments in specialized social science surveys. To
   test this, we compare data from a multi-country expert survey with those
   collected from the two powerful LLMs created by OpenAI and Google. The
   statistical difference between the two sets of data is minimal in most
   cases, supporting our hypothesis, albeit with certain limitations and
   within specific parameters. The tested language models demonstrate
   domain-agnostic algorithmic accuracy, indicating an inherent ability to
   incorporate human knowledge and independently replicate human judgment
   across various subfields without specific training. We refer to this
   property as the `implicit intelligence' of Artificial Intelligence,
   representing a highly promising advancement for social science research.},

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, new and peripheral parties from both the left
   and right of the ideological spectrum challenged the virtual oligopoly
   of social democratic and liberal conservative parties in Western Europe.
   Within the extensive body of literature that investigates the drivers of
   these parties' electoral successes, recent studies have shown that the
   convergence of mainstream parties on the left-right scale has played a
   crucial role. In this article, we build on these contributions to
   investigate whether cross-regional differences exist in the size of this
   convergence and in its impact on challengers' success, focusing on two
   key policy issues for challenger parties, namely redistribution and
   immigration. Results from multilevel regression models on nine European
   democracies reveal that convergence is significantly more marked in
   Southern as compared to Northwestern Europe. We also find that
   mainstream convergence on redistributive issues positively affects
   challengers' success in Southern Europe only. Conversely, mainstream
   convergence on immigration-related issues negatively impacts
   challengers' success in both regions.},
