Title = {The young and the hawkish: Generational differences in conflict
   attitudes in Israel},

Abstract = {How do generational patterns affect public opinion in prolonged
   conflicts? While considerable research has addressed the effects of
   conflicts on children and adolescents, understanding the broader
   generational divides in public attitudes towards conflict resolution
   remains an area with both theoretical and empirical gaps. Such
   understanding is crucial, given its potential to significantly shape
   aggregate public opinion and the trajectory of conflicts. This paper
   focuses on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, examining how support for
   conflict resolution varies across Israeli-Jewish cohorts. It employs
   longitudinal survey data (1981-2019), using both descriptive methods and
   age-period-cohort (APC) regression models. The findings indicate that
   generational differences in public opinion were relatively small until
   the early 2000s. Post this period, younger Israelis have increasingly
   displayed more hawkish attitudes than older generations, coupled with a
   stronger inclination towards right-wing identification. These trends
   pose important questions about the changing nature of support for
   compromise within Israeli society and its implications for the future of
   the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The factors driving these emerging
   generational gaps are complex and merit in-depth exploration. While this
   article touches upon potential explanations, including demographic
   shifts and hope for peace, they do not entirely clarify the observed
   generational differences, highlighting the need for further research.},

Abstract = {The idea that credit can be a private form of insurance against economic
   shocks has recently gained credence, but do individuals really see bank
   credit as an acceptable substitute for social insurance? We conjecture
   that credit constitutes a viable alternative to social insurance for
   those with high incomes and those who face low risk from unemployment.
   Relying on observational data from the European Social Survey between
   2002 and 2010 we conclude that individuals with better credit access
   demand lower levels of redistribution, but we confirm this effect is
   moderated by income and job loss risk. We then conduct a conjoint
   analysis in the United Kingdom that also points to a credit-access
   effect on preferences regarding welfare. Specifically, we find that
   high-income, low-risk individuals prefer lower income taxation (i.e., a
   lower fiscal burden) when credit is cheaply available.},

Abstract = {While there is a substantial research literature on Western `foreign
   fighters' - those young men and women from Europe, North America,
   Australia and elsewhere who traveled to Syria and Iraq, from around
   2011-2017, to join jihadist groups engaged in combat - there is a dearth
   of comparative studies examining the backgrounds of these fighters.
   National variations in the levels of recruitment have been measured and
   samples examined to determine the demographics of these fighters,
   indicating some national variations in who went, how, and maybe why.
   More fulsome comparative data is needed, however, to detect and measure
   such differences to gain insight into the factors conditioning the
   radicalization of these foreign fighters. Calling on original and unique
   datasets, this study presents the results of a comparative analysis of
   Canadian and Swedish foreign fighters. In each case the findings are
   compared with other domestic jihadists as well to delineate if those
   drawn to fight in Syria and Iraq differ. Clear differences emerge in the

Abstract = {Following three decades of armed conflict, the Government of Sri Lanka
   (GoSL) defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 2009. The
   victory was framed as a successful counterterrorism operation, yet, the
   GoSL's military campaign in the Tamil-populated Northern and Eastern
   Provinces of Sri Lanka, faces credible allegations of war crimes, crimes
   against humanity, and genocide. As the armed conflict reached its apex,
   the Tamil diaspora mobilised politically across the globe and the
   participation of younger generation Tamils (YGTs), namely, those who
   were born outside their parents' country of origin, or had settled
   outside of their ancestral homeland as children, caught the attention of
   scholars and analysts. Within this small pool of literature, the
   pervasive and problematic counterterrorism-inspired concept of
   ``radicalisation{''} surfaced. This article contributes to critical
   debates on terrorism by analysing the cursory application of a
   radicalisation framework to the political mobilisation and perspectives
   of YGTs. Based on critical ethnographic research on YGT activism in the
   London diaspora, this article provides an alternative to criminalising
   and marginalising approaches by utilising an emotion-based conceptual
   framework, derived from social movement studies, to unearth and
   understand the complex mechanisms, contexts, and processes surrounding
   their political mobilisation.},

Title = {Youth with clipped wings: Bridging the gap from youth recruitment to
   representation in candidate lists},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {88},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article assesses the extent to which party youth wings participate
   in candidate selection and the factors that explain their (lack of)
   success, focusing on the interplay of formal and informal mechanisms
   with institutional rules. The results indicate an iceberg-shaped
   political recruitment ladder, with a stark compression of youth wing
   representation in the visible steps of candidates and MPs. More youth
   wing candidates are included in party lists as district magnitude
   increases, and there is evidence of an apprenticeship effect, with most
   youth wing candidates who are reselected able to improve their list
   position. More importantly, informal mechanisms and negotiations between
   youth wings and the mother party leadership emerge as a central factor
   in the ability of youth wings to influence candidate lists.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on three main limitations of the literature
   regarding the impact of corruption on democracy. These are the
   distinctions between causality and correlation, channels underlying the
   impact and the shape of the relationship. The study uses recent
   developments in panel data causality and non-linear econometrics, breaks
   democracy down into different components and analyses the form of the
   relationship. We find that the relationship between the variables is
   often non-linear. Control of Corruption leads to a higher democracy; the
   components of democracy are also affected by corruption. These findings
   add to the literature in three respects: (i) corruption has a causal
   effect on democracy and, hence, single equation estimation poses
   problems, (ii) assuming linearity of the relationships between control
   of corruption and democracy is also possibly problematic and (iii) the
   channels of transmission of the effects of corruption on democracy are
   diverse.},

Abstract = {A growing number of studies test key cultural constructs used in
   comparative political research for invariance across countries, only to
   declare these constructs incomparable if the invariance tests fail. The
   assumption underlying this kind of conclusion is that between-country
   differences in within-country factor solutions reflect cross-cultural
   inequivalence of the respective survey items. Using a Bayesian approach,
   we explore variation in measurement quality across countries focusing on
   sexual emancipation. We find that between-country differences in factor
   solutions reflect little more than imbalances in within-country
   dispersions of the construct items. As we demonstrate, discrete and
   bounded response scales used in standard surveys enforce a mathematical
   relationship between extreme country means, low within-country
   dispersions, and weak factor solutions. We formalize this insight by
   introducing a between-within model of cultural variation. Our
   contribution calls into question the practice of declaring constructs to
   be incomparable based on failed invariance tests.},

Abstract = {Support for Ukraine against Russian aggression has been strong across
   Europe, but it is far from uniform. An expert survey of the positions
   taken by political parties in 29 countries conducted mid-2023 reveals
   that 97 of 269 parties reject one or more of the following: providing
   weapons, hosting refugees, supporting Ukraine's path to European Union
   membership, or accepting higher energy costs. Where the perceived threat
   from Russia is most severe, we find the greatest levels of support for
   Ukraine. However, ideology appears to be far more influential. The level
   of a party's populist rhetoric and its European Union skepticism explain
   the bulk of variation in support for Ukraine despite our finding that
   many strongly populist and European Union-skeptical parties take
   moderate pro-Ukraine positions when in government.},

   in the shape of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in 2017. Second,
   the social, with Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization laws denigrating the agency
   of women leading to their resolute mobilization in the 1980s and again
   in 2018 in the shape of the Aurat March and Aurat Azadi March movements.
   Finally, the political, where the military takeover in 1977 invited a
   counter-movement in the form of the Movement for the Restoration of
   Democracy (MRD) in 1981. In 2020, opposition parties formed the Pakistan
   Democratic Movement (PDM) as a counterweight to the incumbent
   civil-military hybrid regime. The article concludes that Pakistan's
   failure to improve on the religious, societal and political indicators
   lies at the core of its dishevelled polity.},

   From Myanmar},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 14},
Abstract = {What explains ethnic minorities' attachment to the state? Our current
   understanding has primarily considered structural factors, particularly
   access to political power and modernization. Diverging from existing
   explanations, I theorize that mundane experiences with the state, in
   street-level bureaucracy, can inform ethnic minorities' attitudes toward
   the state. What they see and experience in street-level bureaucracy
   signals to ethnic minorities what their prospects might be in a country
   that is politically dominated by another ethnic group. Leveraging
   extensive fieldwork in Myanmar, I show that ethnic minorities who have
   had positive encounters with street-level bureaucrats express stronger
   attachment to the state. This is the case even when an ethnic group is
   in direct conflict with the state. I also find that service experiences
   are more relevant in explaining ethnic minorities' attachment to the
   state compared to factors highlighted in existing research.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long criticized media coverage of Congress for its focus
   on conflict over policy substance. To uncover the drivers of this focus,
   we examine news coverage of the congressional response to COVID-19. We
   select the COVID-19 response as an extreme case of Congress coalescing
   quickly to address a major national crisis in an almost entirely
   bipartisan way. Our study confirms prior research documenting a media
   preference for conflict narratives, even in this case. But we also find
   that the practice of beat reporting on Congress is, itself, a key factor
   underlying the dominance of news about conflict. A steady volume of
   reporting on an institution that acts quickly when there is agreement
   but slowly when there is disagreement gives rise to a large-scale
   imbalance favoring stories about conflict. Because conflict necessarily
   takes up more of Congress's time, it dominates beat reporting on the
   institution. We find this imbalance is more pronounced in national
   newspapers, which produce a relatively constant volume of reporting by
   journalists assigned to the ``Congress beat,{''} than in broadcast
   television news, which reports on Congress episodically and often only
   in response to legislative enactments. Our findings shed new light on
   public and scholarly perceptions of the institution's performance.},

Abstract = {During 2023, the Meloni government had to face the difficult management
   of the emergencies caused by the calamitous events that hit Emilia
   Romagna and Tuscany, which brought the long-lasting issue of
   hydrogeological instability back onto the public agenda. More generally,
   in the environmental and land protection fields, the government
   inherited the implementation of the measures associated with the
   strategic axis of the Ecological Transition, contained in the National
   Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR). However, the position of the
   government and that of the parliamentary majority not always fitted with
   the contents of the existing programming, nor with the policies promoted
   by the European institutions. By adopting a qualitative approach and
   combining original and secondary sources, in this work we will analyse
   the actions undertaken by the Meloni government in the environmental
   field in light of the ``responsiveness-responsibility dilemma{''}.
   Particular attention will be paid to the points in continuity and to the
   breaks with the legacies of the past. The analysis shows how the
   government has progressively deviated from consolidated policy
   directions and planning, favouring the responsiveness pole to the
   detriment of responsibility.},

Abstract = {This study explores how the covariance of political ideologies affects
   international threat perceptions in the Australian, UK, and US contexts.
   By synthesizing prior research, it develops multidimensional models of
   political ideologies, revealing four clusters: uni-valence, ambivalence,
   alienated ambivalence, and indifference. The results indicate that some
   respondents are active in simultaneously adopting multiple conflicting
   ideologies (ambivalence and its alienated variant), while others
   indicate either a lack of feeling towards any ideologies (indifference)
   or a positive response to a single ideology (uni-valence). More
   crucially, the findings of this study provide evidence for a non-linear
   and volumetric relationship between ideology and threat perception.
   Overall, threat perception is highest among respondents with a
   univalent, populist ideology, lowest in the ambivalent group, and
   somewhere between these two in the indifferent and alienated ambivalent
   groups. The study contributes to: 1) the multi-dimensionality school of
   ideology studies, by adopting new methods for incorporating
   multi-perspective elements, 2) the constructivist school of threat
   perception in international relations, by demonstrating a more complex
   relationship between ideology and threat perception, and 3) attitudinal
   theory in political psychology, by re-theorising political neutrality.},

Abstract = {The rise of the far right is increasingly raising the question of
   whether partisanship can have negative consequences for democracy. While
   issues such as partisan bias and affective polarization have been
   extensively researched, little is known about the relationship between
   identification with anti-system parties and diffuse system support. I
   address this gap by introducing a novel indicator and utilising the
   GESIS panel dataset, which tracks the rise of a new party, ``Alternative
   for Germany{''} (AfD) from 2013, when the party was founded, to 2017,
   when the AfD, now transformed into a right-wing populist and anti-system
   party, entered the federal parliament for the first time. Employing a
   panel fixed effects design, I demonstrate that identification with
   ``Alternative for Germany{''} reduces trust in the Federal
   Constitutional Court by a considerable margin. These findings are robust
   across various alternative specifications, suggesting that the effects
   of anti-system party identification should not be dismissed.},

Abstract = {Fred Greenstein famously presented Eisenhower's secretive ``hidden
   hand{''} style as an alternative to Richard Neustadt's model of
   presidential leadership, which had emphasized the need for overt control
   over the legislative process. Yet both models assume that the most
   important component of presidential leadership is the ability to
   manipulate governing elites. This article shows that the 1956 Highway
   Act contradicts Greenstein's characterization of Eisenhower as a
   successful hidden-hand leader. Through archival research, I show that
   Eisenhower's role in the Highway Act-by far the most ambitious
   legislative program attempted during his administration-was a decisive
   leadership failure. This finding does not merely undercut Greenstein's
   assessment of Eisenhower's distinctive leadership style, however. It
   exposes problems that result from assuming that presidential success
   should be defined as the ability to control the political process by
   denying other political actors substantive input in decision-making and
   the ability to reach some decisions on their own. Greenstein and
   Neustadt-the originators of widely shared contemporary assumptions about
   the presidency-thus incorrectly theorized the presidency's place in the
   American constitutional system. By empowering independently elected
   legislators, the separation of powers incentivizes presidents with
   ambitious legislative agendas to accommodate the agency of other
   constitutional actors through a degree of transparency and
   deliberativeness. I conclude by sketching an alternative presidential
   leadership model to the one offered by Greenstein and Neustadt, one that
   accommodates rather than resists the Constitution's constraints.},

Title = {The New Racial Spillover: Donald Trump, Racial Attitudes, and Public
   Opinion Toward Accountability for Perpetrators and Planners of the
   January 6 Capitol Attack},
Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {139},
Number = {2},
Pages = {159-176},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {Since the violent January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, federal
   authorities have sought to hold participants and organizers accountable
   for their assault on American democracy. Troublingly, however, a
   substantial fraction of the public opposes the prosecution of
   participants in the assault on the Capitol and rejects charging former
   president Trump with crimes relating to the planning and execution of
   the attack. Why does a substantial fraction of the American public
   oppose accountability for perpetrators of the January 6 attack? In this
   article, we argue that racial attitudes play a central role in
   determining individuals' attitudes toward accountability for the Capitol
   attack. Elaborating on the theory of ``racial spillover,{''} we argue
   that former president Trump's frequent use of racial rhetoric-which
   established a racialized identity and cemented a close relationship
   between negative racial attitudes and support for his presidency among
   members of the mass public-created conditions in which these attitudes
   were likely to ``spill over{''} into the ostensibly non-racialized
   domain of attitudes toward holding perpetrators, planners, and inciters
   accountable for the attack. Because attitudes toward accountability for
   the Capitol attack are inextricable from Trump's racialized persona, we
   hypothesize that negative racial attitudes should be associated with
   increased opposition to accountability for those responsible for the
   attack. Using data from four original, nationally representative surveys
   fielded between 2021 and 2023, we find strong evidence for our racial
   spillover hypothesis and show that individuals with more negative racial
   attitudes are more opposed to accountability for those responsible for
   the Capitol attack.},

Abstract = {The information and communication system of public procurement in Spain,
   mainly articulated through the Public Sector Procurement Platform
   (PLACSP), presents serious gaps in relation to the application of the
   principle of transparency for good governance. In particular, its search
   system is unintuitive and is aimed at users with high knowledge of these
   administrative processes, which does not facilitate the understanding
   and accessibility of the information and documentation published to all
   citizens. Therefore, it can be claimed that the usability and
   accessibility of this platform is poor. Therefore, it is necessary and
   urgent to review this digital tool with the aim of improving both its
   interface and its search system, as a central element and more relevant
   to users, in order to facilitate access to information (especially to
   administrative and technical specifications, awarding companies, the
   amount of contracts, etc.). In our opinion, this platform should be
   turned into a simple, quick and intuitive tool that offers useful
   information that guarantees greater transparency of public procurement
   processes, while contributing to the good functioning of the public
   sector and the eradication of possible corrupt practices. Finally, it
   must expand the information on the consideration of social and
   environmental clauses in public contracts, as this is one of the main
   purposes of the Public Sector Contracts Law itself, together with
   advertising, transparency, non-discrimination and equal treatment, among
   others, which cannot be made unseen.},

Abstract = {This study explores the architectural and demographic dynamics of
   Jerusalem, examining public discourse to determine the presence of
   neo-colonial ethnic segregation and socio-spatial divisions.
   Furthermore, it aims to discern the underlying motivations influencing
   urban architecture and to identify challenges within Jerusalem's
   demographic and architectural frameworks. Approach of the study
   encompasses an extensive review of academic publications, news articles,
   and both qualitative and quantitative data. The study includes
   documentation and archival research published in both international and
   national journals. Significant focus is placed on studies from global
   and regional organizations such as UNESCO, ICOMOS, the UN, IPCC, the EU,
   Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES), UNICEF in the State of Palestine, and
   various urban delineation and conservation projects by T \& Idot;KA
   across the Jerusalem (al-Quds) metropolitan region. The paper critically
   assesses the city's evolution into a space characterized by
   ethnonational divisions, heightened militarization, and increasing
   violence, which suggest a shift from an `ethnocracy' to an `urban
   apartheid.' Finally, this paper proposes transitioning from `ethnocracy'
   to `democracy' as a solution for achieving a truly modern and democratic
   Jerusalem metropolis.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {How should political leaders address the emerging climate crisis if
   citizens are reluctant to accept costly but necessary climate action? In
   this article, I address this question by harnessing insights from the
   realist tradition in political theory. I propose that the realist
   legitimacy framework provides action guidance by offering two broadly
   applicable heuristics for political agents: responsibility and
   responsiveness. These heuristics collide if citizens are unwilling to
   accept policies designed to secure a nation's long-term stability. Faced
   with this problem, some authors make the supposedly realist argument
   that policymakers in liberal democracies should prioritise
   responsibility over responsiveness and embrace eco-authoritarianism to
   address the climate emergency. Against this line of argument, I maintain
   that the realist legitimacy framework entails no such commitment.
   Instead, realists must emphasise that responsible climate action entails
   a sufficient degree of responsiveness. I conclude by sketching how this
   insight may guide democratic leaders and climate activists in the
   future.},

Abstract = {How has the changing structure of the economy during the transition in
   Central and Eastern Europe resulted in reskilling, deskilling, or
   upskilling of the labor force? Using data from the Life in Transition
   Survey and survival analysis we find that the scale of changes in the
   skill-sets has been surprisingly limited. Instead, the transition has
   resulted in a generational change: workers from declining sectors left
   employment, while the young cohorts took up the jobs in the emerging
   sectors. Furthermore, to a large extent, pre-retirement exits can be
   explained by a lack of relevant skills in the older generation that were
   necessary for the open market.},

Title = {Cosmopolitan realism and the inward turn},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 14},
Abstract = {Some self-declared defenders of democracy maintain that a suspension of
   the `cosmopolitan agenda' is necessary to blunt the appeal of insurgent
   right wing populism. I argue that cosmopolitans should support this
   `inward turn' when doing so helps to preserve the long-term viability of
   that agenda. Cosmopolitans must certainly motivate citizens of different
   countries to support it. However, they must also encourage those
   citizens to support democracy and inclusion at home, for support for the
   cosmopolitan agenda becomes less likely in its absence. Therefore,
   cosmopolitans should support the inward turn when doing so makes it
   harder for right wing populists to erode popular support for democracy,
   inclusion, and the cosmopolitan agenda. Practically speaking, then,
   cosmopolitanism should not look that different from liberal nationalism
   in the short-term. Unlike liberal nationalists, though, cosmopolitans
   should only prioritize the defense of democracy and inclusion at home
   for practical reasons - not normative reasons. Accordingly,
   cosmopolitanism should look different from liberal nationalism in the
   long run, but not radically so. I engage with the empirical literature
   on public opinion and pay special attention to Lea Ypi's argument for
   `statist cosmopolitanism.'},

Abstract = {In this article, I claim that Simon Rodriguez, a 19th-century Venezuelan
   thinker, used and reconfigured Jean-Jacques Rousseau's understanding of
   amour-propre to construct a new political foundation for Latin America.
   He sought to channel it and other sentiments toward productive ends with
   a social education. In doing so, Rodriguez departs from Rousseau while
   still addressing the latter's political concerns regarding the benefits
   of egalitarian republicanism and the pitfalls of civilizational
   progress. Instead of accepting political models from antiquity,
   Rodriguez conceives of an egalitarian social republic uniting the rich
   and poor, White and people of color. While skeptical of European
   civilization built on commerce, he sees the possibility of a social
   civilization reconciling the interests of all in society. This
   comparative study of Rodriguez provides a necessary addition to the
   history of political philosophy while offering insights into a mode of
   thinking still informing contemporary politics in Latin America.},

Abstract = {Following the 2021 military coup, a unionwide peaceful anti-coup
   movement emerged in Myanmar, which escalated into armed conflict. The
   aim of this paper is to explain how and why the initially nonviolent
   anti-coup movement radicalised. This study applies the qualitative
   method process-tracing. I argue that the resistance's radicalisation can
   be explained by three interacting mechanisms. First, the framing of
   high-intensity repression as a trigger event provides actors with a
   motivational basis for armed resistance. Second, the initially low
   cohesion and lack of leadership in the movement enabled mobilisation for
   armed resistance in self-organising networks. Third, the contentious
   capacity of longstanding non-state armed actors provides resisters with
   possibilities to implement an armed repertoire.},

Abstract = {Previous research suggests that vetoes can be politically costly for the
   president. To date, however, these inferences have been made based on
   either descriptive or aggregate-level data. While prior work
   demonstrates a correlation between vetoes and evaluations of the
   president, they have not explored how the public evaluates or responds
   to veto politics. We seek to address this gap through an original survey
   experiment that assesses how the public responds to the heightened
   interbranch conflict that surrounds a veto. Our results indicate that
   although a veto can cast the president in a negative light for some,
   there are conditions under which Congress' decision to pass legislation
   it knows the president would veto can backfire. Citizens who are
   informed that Congress provoked a veto and those who are more
   politically knowledgeable are more likely to blame Congress for the
   legislation's failure, even after controlling for partisanship and
   approval.},

Abstract = {The study of coup-proofing holds significant importance in political
   science as it offers insights into critical topics such as military
   coups, authoritarian governance, and international conflicts. However,
   due to the multifaceted nature of coup-proofing and empirical
   inconsistencies with existing indicators, there is a need for a more
   profound understanding and a new measurement methodology. We propose a
   new measure of the extent of coup-proofing, utilizing a Bayesian item
   response theory. We estimate the extent of coup-proofing using a sample
   of 76 countries between 1965 and 2005 and theoretically relevant
   observed indicators. The findings from the estimation demonstrate that
   the extent of coup-proofing varies across regime type, country, and
   time. Furthermore, we verify the construct validity of our measurement.},

Abstract = {Despite growing attention to income inequality in debates about European
   integration, our understanding of its effect on European Union support
   remains limited. Using European Social Survey data from 2002 to 2020, we
   analyse how income inequality and pro-redistribution attitudes shape
   diffuse and specific forms of support for the European Union. We find no
   direct effect of country-level income inequality, while individual
   support for redistribution has a negative effect on both. In line with
   benchmarking theory, inequality emerges as a contextual moderator: in
   unequal national settings, egalitarian citizens are comparatively more
   supportive of further integration than in more equal countries. This
   effect persists when we control for income position, suggesting an
   ideological rather than utilitarian basis for benchmarking European
   Union attitudes. We discuss implications in light of debates about a
   social Europe.},

Abstract = {Does the presence of local political parties increase turnout in
   municipal elections? A handful of previous studies have found that local
   parties indeed have this effect. Against that backdrop, we examine the
   impact of the rapid growth in the number of local parties on voter
   turnout in Swedish local elections. We test the so-called ``best of both
   worlds{''} hypothesis, which predicts that the presence of local parties
   - alongside lists of local branches of national party organizations -
   increases choice for the voters, and thereby increases voter turnout.
   Our empirical tests employ data from seven Swedish local elections
   between 1994 and 2018. Ultimately, and contrary to findings from other
   settings, our results suggest that the presence of local parties does
   not contribute to higher voter turnout in Sweden. We maintain that this
   most likely is due to Sweden being a tough test for this hypothesis
   since Sweden has some unique institutional characteristics, such as
   concurrent elections and high baseline turnout in local elections.},

Abstract = {In their timely article, Andrew Little and Anne Meng make an important
   point. Despite widespread alarm over democratic backsliding, objective
   evidence suggests that the scale of the phenomenon is much more limited
   than many seem to think. Recent power holders around the world have not
   been entrenching themselves more effectively than in the past.
   Incumbents continue to lose elections about as often as they used to,
   and those who win have not been doing so by larger margins. Opposition
   parties are allowed to compete about as frequently today as 10 or 20
   years ago. Moreover, there has been no increase in leaders' ability to
   evade term limits.},

Abstract = {Political trust is usually construed in the terms of political elites'
   duty to be trustworthy. This paper makes a modest yet radical claim,
   contending that in a democratic polity, political elites have also a
   symmetric prima facie duty to trust citizens to be competent and willing
   social actors. The paper offers a general framework for rethinking
   political trust as a bi-directional, rather than uni-directional, social
   relation. ``Trust as an attitude{''} section begins by distinguishing
   trust-as-belief from trust-as-attitude, and contends that only with
   reference to the latter the idea of a duty to trust becomes plausible.
   ``A comprehensive theory of political trust{''} section outlines my
   comprehensive theory of political trust. ``Political trust as delegative
   and as coordinative{''} section distinguishes two basic dimensions of
   political trust: delegative and coordinative. ``Political elites' duty
   to trust{''} section introduces the notion of a political duty to trust,
   and contends that political elites have a prima facie duty to trust
   based on the specific features of coordinative trust. ``Who belongs to
   political elites?{''} section specifies who is bound by this prima facie
   duty and ``Democracy and the circle of trust{''} section reflects on how
   circles of trust can be initiated.},

Abstract = {The BG REACH project used creative arts methods to support residents of
   a post-industrial community in the South Wales Valleys to reflect on
   what the heritage of their local area meant to them. Contrary to
   expectation, participants did not define their shared identity primarily
   in relation to the industrial experience. Connections with the
   pre-industrial past were equally powerful, as were positive views of
   deindustrialisation as a healing of the landscape. Moreover, the pieces
   produced drew extensively upon broader motifs of Welshness, suggesting
   that Welsh identity may not be as terminally fragmented as some scholars
   have argued.},

Abstract = {Chinese modernization is formed in the historical process that adapts
   Marxism to the Chinese context and to the needs of our times. It
   represents a great initiative of the Communist Party of China and the
   Chinese people. Chinese modernization has broken through the problematic
   model of capital-centered modernization found in Western countries, and
   has established a model of people-centered socialist modernization that
   has enormous global importance. The essential requirements of Chinese
   modernization in the new journey of the new era are as follows:
   upholding the leadership of the Communist Party of China and socialism
   with Chinese characteristics; pursuing high-quality development;
   developing whole-process people's democracy; enriching the cultural
   lives of the people; achieving common prosperity for all; promoting
   harmony between humanity and nature; building a human community with a
   shared future; and creating a new form of human advancement. This is
   necessary not only for building a modern socialist country in all
   respects and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, but
   also for further adapting Marxism to the Chinese context and to the
   needs of our times.},

Title = {A DECISIVE FACTOR? PRO-GOVERNMENT EXTERNAL INTERVENTIONS IN CIVIL WARS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {6},
Pages = {104-121},
Abstract = {Civil wars have been the most prevalent type of armed conflicts
   post-World War II. Despite the internal nature of such conflicts,
   foreign assistance is frequently provided to one of the parties
   involved, with official governments being the most frequent
   beneficiaries. This study employs extensive empirical evidence to
   analyze how external involvement in support of government forces
   influences the outcome of civil wars. Drawing on the bargaining model of
   war, a civil war is portrayed as a continuous process where the parties
   constantly reassess their chances of success based on individual battle
   outcomes. One-sided foreign intervention complicates this evaluation by
   exacerbating power and information asymmetries inherent to internal
   conflicts, leading to increased uncertainty about the opponent's
   capabilities and intentions, as well as doubts about their ability to
   credibly commit to peace agreements. Using Cox proportional hazards
   model, the author finds that external pro-government support primarily
   serves to sustain the recipient's ability to continue fighting rather
   than significantly enhance its chances of victory in a civil war.
   Furthermore, the impact of such support varies depending on the type of
   intervention: indirect assistance is associated with a reduced
   likelihood of the opposition prevailing, whereas direct military
   intervention does not have a statistically significant influence on the
   outcome.},

   THROUGH FDI AND ICT},

Abstract = {Bosnia and Herzegovina's transition from socialism to capitalism has led
   to fundamental changes in the country's economic structure, with
   unemployment, FDI, economic growth, and information technologies
   becoming critical factors in this process. Information and Communication
   Technology (ICT) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can promote
   economic growth and generate employment, helping to tackle unemployment
   through various channels. Bosnia and Herzegovina has been facing
   long-term unemployment for years. Thus, this study uses an
   Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach and
   structural break technique to explore the impact of FDI, ICT, and growth
   on unemployment in Bosnia and Herzegovina for the period 1997-2022. The
   research findings indicate that FDI has a negative impact on
   unemployment in the long run. On the other hand, ICT has a positive
   impact on unemployment in the long run. Moreover, empirical findings
   demonstrated that there is a negative and significant relationship
   between growth and unemployment in the long run. This implies the
   validity of Okun's Law for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore, the
   study brings forth a crucial insight that the impacts of FDI on
   unemployment are not uniform and differ significantly based on the type
   of FDI inflows.},

Abstract = {When you think about the interview and the survey, you think of social
   research instruments, but with different characteristics and in some
   cases attached to incompatible paradigms. However, they share a
   fundamental common characteristic that makes them part of the same
   continuum: they are dialogic-conversational. Thus, here it is stated
   that they are a specific epistemological moment within the dialogue, and
   that, as such, their characteristics will be determined by the
   restriction and freedom to ask, and by the restriction and freedom to
   answer. Consequently, interviews and surveys are expressions of a
   conversational continuum that conditions the interaction between those
   who ask and those who answer. This could even disrupt the paradigmatic
   ascription of each instrument. Every social scientist should be aware of
   this.},

Abstract = {South Africa occupies a strategic geographic position at the southern
   tip of the African continent, serving as a potential trade and
   investment gateway for countries in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. It
   is a key partner for Pakistan's Look Africa Policy. Pakistan and South
   Africa, bound by shared values and a focus on common interests since
   establishing diplomatic ties in 1994, have cultivated a long-standing
   partnership. However, a significant gap remains in the academic
   exploration of this relationship. This study delves into the
   politico-diplomatic, economic, and defence aspects of Pakistan-South
   Africa relations, employing the concept of national interest as outlined
   by Morgenthau and Neuchterlein. Employing a qualitative analysis, this
   study argues that high-level visits, the establishment of institutional
   mechanisms, and the formalisation of cooperation through Memoranda of
   Understanding (MoUs) have significantly shaped the direction,
   facilitation, and governance of Pakistan-South Africa relations. This
   research highlights three key findings: despite frequent
   leadership-level exchanges and interactions between parliamentarians and
   policymakers, the relationship lacks the necessary vigour; while trade
   between Pakistan and South Africa has grown steadily, Pakistan
   experiences a trade deficit with its partner; and defence collaboration
   remains a significant aspect of their relationship. This article posits
   that the existing Pakistan-South Africa bilateral relationship holds the
   potential to blossom into a more formalised and enduring strategic
   partnership, contingent upon the implementation of well-defined and
   practical initiatives.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article, that frames inside a project doctoral wider, is
   to investigate the degree of adoption and use of various social networks
   in small local public administration - characterized by unique
   structural features and very limited resources, but closest to citizens
   -, assessing the impact of internal factors based on the opinions of
   those responsible for their management. Using ``Enacting Electronic
   Government Success{''} as a theoretical reference model and local
   entities in the province of Lugo as the empirical basis of the study, it
   seeks to determine whether these digital platforms, with a distinctly
   social nature, have the capacity to transform organizational processes
   and whether institutional aspects influence the adoption of these new
   communication channels within a segment of public administration that
   has been relatively unexplored in this field until now. As we will see,
   initial resistance is quickly overcome, and the confidence of local
   administrations in social technologies is growing, associated with the
   idea that their incorporation can improve transparency and citizen
   participation, considering them as tools with high disruptive potential
   capable of creating, organizing, exchanging, providing information,
   interconnecting individuals and enabling multidirectional communication.},

   Evidence from Norway},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Abstract = {To what extent is the underrepresentation of ethnic minorities in
   politics due to ethnic bias? While this question has interested
   researchers for a long time, direct evidence of ethnic bias in
   party-controlled nomination processes is scarce. We conducted survey
   experiments with politicians and voters in Norway, where parties control
   the nomination process, to examine bias against ethnic minority
   candidates. The politicians evaluated candidate profiles with randomly
   assigned information about the candidates' ethnic backgrounds. Contrary
   to our expectations, we find that ethnic minority candidates receive
   higher quality scores and better rankings than ethnic majority
   candidates. However, the results of a list experiment with voters show
   that a substantial share of right-wing voters has reservations against
   voting for a party list with many ethnic minority candidates.
   Consequently, our study suggests that while the political elite wants
   ethnically diverse party lists, for some parties, such lists might have
   an electoral cost.},

Title = {PARTY-POLITICAL DYNAMICS IN NORWAY AS A FACTOR IN RUSSIAN-NORWEGIAN
   RELATIONS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {4},
Pages = {38-55},
Abstract = {The relations between Russia and Norway are of a contradictory nature,
   containing both positive and negative elements. In the scientific
   literature, the systemic factors affecting Russian-Norwegian relations
   are well studied, while the internal political reasons for the
   transformation of bilateral relations are insufficiently explored. In
   2013, i.e. before the international political crisis of 2014, a number
   of studies noted the cooling of relations between Russia and Norway. At
   the same time, a center-right coalition came to power in Norway in 2013.
   The empirical base of the study consists of texts of debates in the
   Norwegian parliament and program documents of Norwegian parties. The
   article analyzed the collected data quantitatively and qualitatively.
   The main method of the quantitative analysis was a targeted sentiment
   analysis. As a result of the quantitative analysis, it was found that
   the parties in the center-left ruling coalition had a more positive
   stance towards Russia than the parties in the center-right coalition. On
   the basis of this qualitative analysis, three main factors determining
   the position of one or another party in relation to Russia were
   identified. First, the view of Norway's position within the framework of
   Russia-NATO and Russia-EU relations, which reflects the party's opinion
   about Norway's place in the system of international relations. Secondly,
   the value content of relations with Russia, which is connected with the
   ideology of party representatives and the presence of positive
   historical experience. Thirdly, the assessment of Russia as a threat to
   Norway's security. As a result, it was found that the left-wing parties
   are generally more inclined to consider Norway as a more autonomous and
   independent actor in relation to the EU and NATO than the right parties.
   This is due to the positive experience of the left parties in their
   interaction with Russia, as well as the higher level of importance of
   development issues in the northern regions of Norway. For right-wing
   parties, liberal values play an important role in the context of
   relations with Russia. In addition, they are more inclined to view
   Russia as a threat to Norway's security than the center-left and
   center-right parties.},

Title = {MILITARY-POLITICAL STRATEGY IN THE GERMAN PARTY DEBATE BEFORE AND AFTER
   THE ``ZEITENWENDE{''}: TRENDS AND CONSEQUENCES},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {The ``Zeitenwende{''} announced by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in 2022
   has seriously altered the German domestic political debate. For the
   first time since the end of the Cold War, German politicians have begun
   to put the issue of their own country's defense capability as one of the
   central topics of internal political discussion. The changes in the
   public debate provide a new perspective on the current trends in the
   political landscape, the changing balance of power and the
   prioritization of various topics in domestic politics. The author
   therefore aims to determine the place of the domestic German debate on
   military-political issues. For this purpose, the first objective of the
   article is to examine the evolution of the German public discourse
   around military issues, noting its limitations and marginalization. The
   second task is to study the development after the announced
   ``Zeitenwende{''} in 2022, focusing on the deliberate politicization of
   this issue by the leading German parties, which for the first time in
   recent decades are forced to search for their own niche in military
   policy. The latest developments since February 2022 are examined through
   the prism of key party documents and government decrees, as well as
   public statements of leading politicians. The author assesses the
   orientation of key actors and the magnitude of their influence on
   political processes This approach allows to embed the study in the
   existing body of publications and adds novelty through the analysis of
   current documents. As a result, the author illustrates how the German
   military strategy, having become one of the central themes in
   contemporary German politics, immediately became a ``bargaining chip{''}
   in the disputes between the parties.},

Title = {A STATUS OF UKRAINIAN REFUGEES IN EUROPE - CASE STUDY OF THE CZECH
   REPUBLIC AND FRANCE},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Europe has faced many migration challenges in recent years. The
   migration crisis of 20152016, when millions of illegal migrants tried to
   reach Europe. In 2022, Russia began an invasion of Ukraine, and millions
   of Ukrainian refugees were forced to leave their homes. Therefore, this
   study investigated and analyzed the factors leading Ukrainian refugees
   to relocate to the Czech Republic and France. A secondary goal was to
   examine the subjective refugee's perception of their ability to
   integrate into the majority society. A quantitative research survey was
   carried out through a questionnaire, in which 8,575 Ukrainian refugees
   participated. The results show that Ukrainian refugees stay in the Czech
   Republic primarily due to cultural similarities, work opportunities, and
   the availability of education. Meanwhile, for Ukrainian refugees staying
   in France the intercultural environment, openness of people, and support
   from the state are important. 76.53\% of the surveyed Ukrainian refugees
   in the Czech Republic and 50.33\% of the participating Ukrainian
   refugees in France rate the help and support from the state and society
   as sufficient. Integration into the majority society was rated
   positively by more than 82\% of surveyed Ukrainian refugees in both
   countries, slightly more positively in the case of completing an
   integration or language course. While the first months of the war were
   in the spirit of providing the necessary assistance to Ukrainian
   refugees, now it is necessary to focus on their integration into
   mainstream society. Only then can the migration process be completed
   successfully, and everyone can benefit from it.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The political change that took place in Venezuela in the heat of the
   Bolivarian Revolution brought with it a modification in the correlation
   of forces and in the way in which the country's elites were configured,
   with the emergence of new power groups that modified the structure of
   the state, entering into direct conflict with the hegemonic corporations
   of the previous political period. Through the Constituent Assembly and a
   whole institutional operation, chavism managed to weaken the political
   parties of the elitist bipartisanism and subsequently promote the growth
   of companies and corporations that presented a line of action in line
   with the Bolivarian project. From a populist rhetoric of an antagonistic
   nature, Chavez was able to construct a -subject people- that opposed the
   project of the elites, thus assuming the risks inherent to this type of
   discourse: extreme social polarisation and the tendency towards hyper
   -personalist leadership. Nevertheless, the first years of his mandate
   were marked by economic development focused on the reduction of poverty
   and inequality, and the will to dynamise a national economy outside the
   interests of big capital and in favour of the social majorities left
   unprotected by the previous regime.},

Title = {Politicised at Home but not in Council: The European Coordination of
   Social Security Systems},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {After seven years of negotiations, the European Parliament and the
   Council have yet to agree on the reform of one of the most essential
   regulations facilitating cross-border worker mobility in the EU: the
   Coordination of Social Security Systems (EC 883/2004). The lack of
   agreement remains puzzling, as all negotiating partners are generally in
   favour of the reform. Similar proposals on social policy, such as the
   Posting of Workers Directive or the Minimum-wage Directive, were also
   challenging to achieve but could be agreed upon. This article tests
   whether ``unpolitics{''}-a destructive approach by populist governments
   in the Council to undermine EU policymaking-is the reason for the
   persisting deadlock on the file. The central finding of this article is
   that the interplay of populism and the status of member states as
   sending or receiving workers shape unpolitical behaviour. Contrary to
   expectations, unpolitics is largely absent in the behaviour of populist
   and non-populist governments. Unpolitical behaviour does not promise
   high gains for the populist governments from Central and Eastern Europe
   because these member states send workers. The smooth functioning of the
   freedom of workers is essential for them and their national discourses
   do not discuss the freedom of movement in the context of welfare
   chauvinism. Welfare chauvinism is much stronger in countries that
   receive workers, however, populists were not in power in these member
   states and therefore there was no unpolitical behaviour. The findings
   show that unpolitical behaviour is not used by mainstream governments,
   not even when it would seem likely from the nature of the policy issue.
   This article highlights that the probability of unpolitical behavior is
   influenced not only by the nature of the policy issue itself but also by
   domestic institutional and structural factors, as well as the national
   discourse.},

Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},

Number = {33},
Abstract = {Two emblematic figures of Neapolitan folklore were brought to the screen
   by the actor Toto: the pazzariello, a town crier and the jettatore, the
   ``spellcaster{''}. Charged with complex symbolism mixing superstition
   and social satire, they offer fertile ground for the analysis of popular
   representations and their evolution over time. By embodying these roles
   in film, Toto not only entertained the public but also contributed to
   revaluing a little-known part of Italian cultural heritage. Through the
   study of these characters, it is possible to explore the complex
   relationships between tradition and modernity, between popular beliefs
   and rationality, as well as the way in which cinema can serve as a
   vector of cultural transmission and transformation. A veritable mask of
   twentieth-century theatre and cinema, and a bearer of a certain memory
   of archaic traditions transmitted beyond the ambient conformism and the
   diktats of the society of his time, the actor disseminates the culture
   from which he comes on a national level, to the point of permeating all
   Italian comedy, thus creating original extensions through irony and
   derision. Through the analysis of the representations of these two
   emblematic figures of Neapolitan folklore by the actor Toto, we will
   study the protest potential of pazzariello and the highlighting of the
   jettatore's fatalism that annihilates entire generations.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {This paper analyses the public policies aimed at non -salaried workers,
   implemented in Argentina to address the socioeconomic consequences of
   the pandemic, considering: a) the way in which they participated in the
   regulation of working conditions from establishing the essential or non
   -essential activities, and offering differential forms of support for
   different categories of workers and productive units; and b) the family
   and collective strategies deployed in the face of the limitations and
   access difficulties to them. We used a qualitative methodology based on
   semi -structured interviews with two groups of non -salaried workers:
   street vendors and delivery platform workers, with the analysis of
   regulations and statistical information. The article shows that the
   implemented policies during the pandemic replicated existing
   intervention schemes in which formal salaried work has a fundamental
   gravitation. From this, the essential and non -essential sectors of
   activity, the types of state intervention, the resources and the quality
   of benefits were distinguished according to the formal -informal /
   salaried -non -salaried employment status. This scheme (re)produced and
   deepened inequalities in protection and access to rights and tended to
   place the non -salaried in the assistance space. While seeking to
   address social needs, the policies revealed the fractures in the world
   of work that acquired a new entity during the pandemic.},

Title = {Critical Actors and the Challenges in Mainstreaming Gender in Taiwan's
   Parliament},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Taiwan is currently Asia's leader in gender equality on three
   indicators: Its national legislature comprises 42 percent women, the
   largest proportion among all Asian countries; it was the first Asian
   country to legalize same-sex marriage; and it has a popularly elected
   woman president not from a politically established family. Despite these
   advances, efforts to make Taiwan's parliament gender-sensitive has
   encountered constraints. While new institutions were created to make the
   parliament a more gender-friendly workplace, little progress was made
   regarding gender mainstreaming in the legislative process. This article
   points out that parliamentary parties are missing actors in gender
   mainstreaming. The article concludes that unless all constitutional
   branches practice it, gender mainstreaming as a state strategy to
   promote gender equality},

Journal = {POLITOLOGIJA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {113},
Number = {1},
Pages = {38-70},
Abstract = {Although there were many disagreements in transatlantic relations before
   COVIC-19, the pandemic accelerated tensions in transatlantic relations
   even more. The inauguration of the new US president Joe Biden, however,
   has been perceived as a new chapter in transatlantic relations. The
   paper aims to assess the COVID-19 pandemic's possible security
   implications to a transatlantic security community (TSC), focusing on
   two aspects in particular: the transatlantic security community's
   perception of COVID-19 and adaptation to this challenge. The paper stems
   from the idea that transatlantic countries compose a transatlantic
   security community. It examines the COVID-19 implications to several
   tiers of features that should be present in every security community:
   namely, the perception of challenges to security, patterns of
   communication and policy coordination, as well as to institutional
   framework. The paper argues that COVID-19 has not transformed the
   transatlantic security community; however, it highlighted certain
   problematic aspects of transatlantic relations.},

Journal = {DESAFIOS},

Abstract = {The period of the national government of the Cambiemos alliance
   (2015-2019) signified a new sce-- nario in Argentina where human rights
   policies and the hegemony of memories condemning the state terrorism of
   the seventies and the last dictatorship were challenged. This article
   investigates the confrontational strategy of the human rights movement
   for responding to the State through a qualitative methodology and an
   analytical approach to a corpus of cases on a national and regional
   scale. It also explores the strategies and collective interventions that
   various activists performed in public settings. The research shows that,
   in the face of the renewed challenge, the movement's actions were
   strengthened and charged with new meanings that obey the attempts to
   defend, , dispute, , and preserve a past recognized as a legacy,
   sustained by the moral duty of its memory, considering it as an
   inalienable right. Thus, it is hoped to contribute to the study of the
   behavior of social actors who collectively championed the fight against
   the advance of the new right wings and battle the uses and interpreta--
   tions of the recent past that they display with great prominence in
   their political agenda.},

   Rights Issues},
Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {440-460},
Abstract = {In British Columbia (BC), Canada, mental health reforms over the last
   decade have moved back and forth between calls for practices that
   restrict human rights and those that are rooted in equity and social
   justice. In this article, we explore some of these tensions and their
   implications for human rights and equity in mental health care by
   critically analyzing three policies guiding mental health reform in BC
   using an intersectionality-based policy framework. Specifically, we
   interrogate the effects of a biomedical and individualized framing of
   mental health and substance use. We argue that such a framing is
   buttressed by neoliberal ideology and lays the groundwork for public and
   professional acceptance of coercive practices with particular
   consequences for Indigenous and racialized populations. This framing is
   juxtaposed with a holistic wellness and trauma-informed policy framework
   anchored by an understanding of the impact of colonization. However,
   what is missing in both policy framings is a full account of the
   documented ongoing human rights violations experienced by many people
   accessing BC's mental health system. Our analysis shows how applying an
   intersectionality-based policy framework allows for a deeper exploration
   of the complex, interlocking systems of power and oppression that give
   rise to these human rights violations. We conclude with a discussion of
   the important role that decolonizing and intersectional approaches play
   for capturing the complexities of systemic inequities and advancing
   mental healthcare that protects and promotes mental wellbeing and human
   rights.},

Abstract = {In the shift toward the Early Modern era, the end-centric temporality of
   the Middle Ages underwent a critical reevaluation, which spawned four
   distinct historical paradigms in the interplay between eschatology and
   politics. This article delineates these paradigms as follows: the
   revolutionary, where political constructs undergo a metamorphosis toward
   the eschatological, culminating in their complete dissolution within it;
   the progressive, in which political elements evolve in the direction of
   eschatological thought while retaining their distinct existence; the
   conservative, where political structures act to curtail the influence of
   eschatological expectations; and the post-apocalyptic, wherein both
   political and eschatological spheres merge into the economic,
   exemplifying the cultural logic of late capitalism. Utilizing process
   tracing as a methodological tool within the framework of critical
   realism, the study investigates the dynamic processes through which
   societies confront and potentially overcome apocalyptic scenarios. It
   reveals that poetic and political pluralism serves as a transformative
   mechanism, facilitating the potential overcoming of apocalyptic threats.
   However, this overcoming is only achieved in the progressive model,
   which is marked by the adoption of a polytheistic political myth and a
   clear separation between the domains of politics and ethics. In
   contrast, the post-apocalyptic model is characterized by a radical
   proliferation of apocalyptic narratives, which leads to the
   normalization and institutionalization of a metaphorical `worldly hell.'
   In this context, the political and eschatological are reconstituted
   within the economic domain, signaling a shift to a new cultural and
   ideological paradigm dominated by capitalist ideology},

Abstract = {Recognizing the pivotal role of casualties as a metric for assessing the
   success of terrorist acts, this study endeavors to unravel the
   underlying factors shaping the casualty count in drone terrorist attacks

   significant factors influencing the number of terrorist casualties. Our
   findings reveal the paramount importance of the target facility's
   significance, the attack type, the utilization of remote-controlled
   drones, the deployment of suicide drones equipped with explosive
   payloads, and the audacious strategy of swarming drone attacks.},

Title = {IMAGE OF CHINA AS AN ANTI-MUSLIM ``OTHER{''} IN THE INDONESIAN MEDIA},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {1},
Pages = {163-173},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to analyze, using Indonesian media
   contents, images of China as an Alien and as a country pursuing a policy
   that is interpreted in Indonesia as anti-Islamic. The novelty of the
   study lies in the analysis of modern nationalist political imagination
   in the discursive space formed by the Indonesian media. The author comes
   to the conclusion that in this imaginary space negative images of China
   are formed, which subsequently circulate in it and are purposefully
   promoted with the aim of constructing the image of China in Indonesia as
   a universal ideological and political Other. The article shows that 1)
   the Indonesian nationalist imagination, through the media, actively
   reproduces negative images of China as a subject of the policy of
   assimilation of Muslim minorities on the territory of the PRC, 2) in the
   discourses of Indonesian expert and analytical communities, narratives
   are promoted about the authoritarian nature of the political regime of
   the PRC and its policies aimed at politicizing Islam and its subsequent
   integration into the functioning mechanism of this regime. Such a policy
   is interpreted in Indonesia as ideologically limiting the activities of
   Chinese Muslims and putting them under the control of communist
   ideology, which gives grounds to characterize the PRC as a political and
   ideological Other. Narratives that highlight the unresolved problems
   between the China state and Islamic communities play an important role
   in promoting the image of the PRC as an undemocratic and authoritarian
   state. The results of the study suggest that the evolution of
   anti-Chinese narratives and the further promotion in the Indonesian
   political imagination of the image of China as a universal Other and a
   state politically and ideologically alien to Islam will strengthen the
   legitimation of anti-Chinese phobias and stereotypes traditional for
   Indonesian society at both the political and religious levels.},

Abstract = {Kazakhstan's economy is one of the most carbon -intensive in the world.
   State subsidies for fossil fuels lead to low energy prices and weaken
   incentives for energy efficiency and the use of green technologies.
   Energy-intensive sectors such as the metal, mining, and chemical
   industries are favoured. Overcoming dependence on fossil fuels requires
   a comprehensive structural transformation of the entire economy. This
   also includes state support for the transition to green energy.},

Abstract = {Russia increasingly views the agricultural sector through a geopolitical
   lens. In particular, the export of grain is intended to generate income
   for the state budget. At the same time it serves as an instrument of
   foreign policy towards countries in the Global South. Russia's growing
   share of the world wheat market favours this plan. Foreign agricultural
   trading companies are being forced out of Russia, while domestic ones
   are being pressured into state-affiliated corporations. This also helps
   to circumvent sanctions.},

Title = {BALKANIZATION VS EUROPEANIZATION: CONCEPTUAL DECONSTRUCTION},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {5},
Pages = {154-166},
Abstract = {The article is dedicated to the deconstruction of the binary opposition
   between the concepts of ``Balkanization{''} and ``Europeanization{''}.
   The initial phase of deconstruction entails a critical examination of
   conventional conceptualizations that reflect power relations between
   Balkans and Europe. A particular emphasis is placed on the dominant
   perception of balkanization as a process of fragmentation and
   barbarization, which is a representation commonly depicted within
   Western strategic discourse. As an alternative, the authentic concept of
   balkanization, formulated by Yugoslav avant-guardists during the early
   twentieth century, is analysed. The avant-guard movement Zenitism
   proclaimed the slogan of the Balkanization of Europe and featured the
   figure of Barbarogenious-Decivilizer. This approach not only represents
   an inversion of the Western perspective on the Balkans, but also draws
   upon ideas of internationalism and class struggle, deriving inspiration
   from the experience of the Russian revolution. The concept of
   Europeanization is examined in both broad and narrow senses - as a
   notion of modernization and as transformations caused by the
   institutional influence of the European Union. The concept of
   europeanization, positioned as a positive project and vision of a better
   future, stands in contrast to the Balkan past of the region. With such
   as interpretation, the successful implementation of the europeanization
   agenda would entail the complete erasure of Balkan subjectivity and
   identity. Europeanization is conceptualized as a process of de-
   balkanization. In the concluding phase of deconstruction, during the
   stage of ``reassembly{''}, an alternative perception of balkanization is
   put forward. In accordance with the ideas of Zenitism and the political
   experience of the Balkan peoples' struggle for independence and the
   establishment of a common stated, balkanization is perceived as, on the
   one hand, resistance and rebellion; on the other hand, as a desire to
   overcome borders and internationalization. Accordingly, europeanization
   is perceived as a process of construction of homogeneous modern
   nation-states. It can be argued that fragmentation is indeed a
   consequence and essence of europeanization.},

Abstract = {This article traces the incident on the Greece-Turkey border in spring
   2020 as a turning point in asylum seeker flow management in Greece. It
   argues that the handling of the event can be approached using moral
   panic theory, and it explains why the government has chosen its tough
   stance against these people. It further explores the government's
   rhetoric during this event and the consequences of this shift both on
   the asylum policies leading to pushbacks and on the legitimization of
   these policies within the Greek society, which could be claimed to have
   made the Pylos shipwreck acceptable, as examined in its last section.},

Abstract = {Conducting feminist research during the global COVID-19 pandemic has
   evoked a renewed interest in the concept of care within our research
   team. The purpose of this paper is to provide concrete examples of how
   feminist ethics of care changed the initial and ongoing design of a
   community-engaged research project in Ontario, Canada. Drawing from
   examples and lessons learned, we focus on various adjustments to our
   methodological decision-making that intentionally honoured and
   prioritized our responsibilities to community partners, research
   participants, broader communities impacted by research, and the research
   team. By illustrating the methodological and ethical implications of
   these decisions, we argue that attending to these responsibilities
   prioritized both feminist research ethics and feminist ethics of care.
   As a result, we propose moving towards a conceptualization of a feminist
   research ethics of care, and discuss the value of this concept for
   researchers studying social justice.},

Abstract = {The paper introduces an ideal type of anti-regime movements against
   illiberal regimes in East-Central Europe, employing the Weberian concept
   of the ideal type as a theoretical model. These movements aim to
   constrain regime building, restructure political institutions, and
   prevent the expansion of illiberal regimes into subsystems such as civil
   society, culture, and the economy. Initially focused on specific
   conflicts, these movements often broaden their scope over time,
   attracting individuals who were not directly involved in the original
   disputes but who seek to express general discontent with illiberal
   regimes. The ideal type is differentiated from counter-hegemonic and
   public policy movements. Empirical analysis of this ideal type is based
   on large-scale protest waves in Hungary and Poland. The characteristics
   of the anti-regime movement are shaped by historical legacies and the
   particular aspects of de-democratization in East-Central Europe, rooted
   in the democratic transition of 1989. This concept of anti-regime
   movements can serve as a crucial foundation for empirical research,
   offering insights into the differences between social movements in
   Western and Eastern Europe.},

Abstract = {The Moscow regime further intensified its policy of repression in 2023.
   Most of the laws establishing a military dictatorship were already
   passed in 2022. In 2023, the offenses defined there were punished with
   higher penalties and the paragraphs were applied even more arbitrarily.
   This was not without effect. There is hardly any public protest against
   the war. In the second half of 2023, the number of new criminal
   proceedings and convictions fell slightly. However, the sentences handed
   down were demonstratively harsh. The transfer of misdemeanour
   proceedings to criminal proceedings also serves the goal of deterrence.
   It must be expected that in 2024 the authorities will attempt to cut off
   people in Russia even more from access to the websites and channels of
   journalists, politicians, and other well-known individuals who have
   emigrated.},

Abstract = {How do we repair and reconcile a society broken multiple times by years
   of political violence and cyclic mass atrocity events? Reconciliation
   processes in post-conflict societies tend to favour state-led peace
   processes to aid individuals and communities alike to heal, make sense
   of the past while also imagining and forging an interdependent future
   together. The Burundi Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC),
   established in 2014, has the mandate to investigate past crimes and mass
   violence events dating from 1885 to the 4 December 2008 ceasefire with
   the aim of aiding truth-telling, reconciliation and transitional
   justice. The article comments on how the TRC shapes ongoing healing,
   reconciliation and transitional justice efforts in post-conflict
   Burundi. This article uses desk-based research to draw insights from
   documented works and reports of the TRC between 2018 and 2022. The TRC's
   findings sparked multiple narratives and public discourse in the Senate
   which further led to the reexamination of the 1972-1973 massacre, the
   legacy of colonisation and its impact in cementing ethnic divisions that
   led to cyclic mass violence in Burundi.},

Title = {ELECTORAL (NON)PARTICIPATION AS AN ONGOING PHENOMENON IN SLOVAK AND
   SWISS SOCIETY},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {One of the main problems of modern democracies is the alienation of
   citizens from political processes. In this context, civil society
   represents an important part of the democratic process. It provides
   citizens with an alternative option, in addition to the possibilities
   represented by political parties and lobby groups, to express different
   opinions and promote different interests in decision-making processes.
   On a global scale, Switzerland has longterm shown the highest values of
   satisfaction with its democracy and is a classic example of a political
   system using strong elements of direct democracy in practice. In the
   context of the possibilities of political participation of citizens in
   Switzerland, in addition to traditional elections, the two institutions
   of direct democracy, namely the referendum and the people's initiative,
   are the most widely used alternatives. On the other hand, the scheme
   shown by S. Huntington in his theory of the third wave of
   democratization in connection with the institutionalization of
   democratic political behavior is fully confirmed in Slovak society.
   According to his theory, resignation, or lack of interest in political
   affairs, mistrust of state authorities and politicians is a
   manifestation of disillusionment that arose in the new democratic
   systems. Most of these new democracies were characterized by the fact
   that at the time of the regime change, the participation of citizens in
   elections was very high, but in the following period it began to decline
   sharply. The aim of the submitted contribution will be to present the
   realities of two civil societies with their diametrically different
   historical-political development and, thanks to the comparison of
   selected elements, to bring both the status and common/different
   features regarding the phenomenon of persistent electoral (non-
   )participation in the conditions of the Slovak Republic and the Swiss
   Confederation.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {With more than 60 groups around the world, 10,000 young people
   participating weekly in its activities, and an unusual visibility beyond
   religious circles thanks to the multitudinous concerts of its Christian
   pop group, Hakuna is a rara avis in secularized Spain. Our research is
   based on a theoretical amalgam that combines analyses of religious
   change and social movement studies-two literatures that rarely cross
   paths. We analyze Hakuna taking into account three analytical axes: its
   triple organizational structure, mobilization repertoires, and identity
   work. To do so, we use a multi-methods qualitative design, primarily
   based on netnography and secondary data analysis. The article reveals
   the characteristics that distinguish Hakuna from other lay movements in
   a context of cultural backlash: (1) the cross-fertilization between its
   association of the faithful, foundation, and music group; (2) its
   strategy of spiritualization of leisure and its alignment with the ``psi
   industry{''} of personal well-being; (3) its digital apostolate and
   corporate marketing tactics, and, finally, (4) the ``friend-friend{''}
   logic that seeks to re-Christianize exculturated youth and overcome
   cleavages between Catholic organizations in a context of growing
   polarization around religion.},

Abstract = {Political parties in Quebec face dilemmas when it comes to language and
   translation policy: French is the province's only official language and
   the mother tongue of the vast majority of the population. However, a
   significant percentage of the population, between 10 per cent and 15 per
   cent depending on the criteria, is considered English-speaking. In this
   context, and because every vote matters, parties translate some material
   into English, but what they translate and to what extent varies from one
   party to another. This contribution examines the languages of seven
   communication tools used by Quebec political parties during the 2022
   provincial election, that is, their name, logo, slogan, website,
   program, social media accounts and election signs. The results show that
   there is a link between language and translation practices, on the one
   hand, and each party's policy position with respect to languages and the
   political status of Quebec within Canada, on the other.},

Journal = {POLITOLOGIJA},

Volume = {116},
Number = {4},
Pages = {59-108},
Abstract = {The article focuses on strategic culture as an analytical tool that
   provides a deeper understanding of a state's behavior and its strategic
   choice to use force, whether for aggression or self-defense, using
   Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine as a case study. While strategic
   culture is generally resistant to change, we identified shifts in
   Ukraine's strategic culture in response to external shocks in 2014 and
   2022. This was based on an analysis of military-political behavior
   patterns, components, and manifestations of strategic culture, as
   reflected in state strategies on national security and defense, as well
   as in other relevant documents and texts. We argue that Russia's
   aggressive military-political behavior, shaped by Soviet-imperial
   revanchist sentiments, has become an existential threat to Ukraine. This
   study contributes to a better understanding of why some conflict
   resolution measures and strategies have proven ineffective in addressing
   the ongoing Russian war.},

   COMMUNICATION},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {2},
Pages = {80-95},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to the study of the dynamics of development of
   concepts that justify political choice. There is a general turn from the
   moral justification of political choice to ontological concepts based on
   the ideas of pragmatic and impartial behavior in the search for criteria
   for the ``correct{''} decision, which includes the truth and the
   institutions that ensure it. The epistemic concept of democracy, based
   on Condorcet's jury theorem, defines the possibility of achieving the
   correct choice through majority rule voting, implies a competent,
   independent and sincere voter, which ensures an increase in the
   probability of the correct choice. The expansion of the composition of
   participants in political choice increased the role of diversity of
   knowledge and opinions in the justification, which led to the concept of
   the ``smart plurality{''}, which ensures the correct choice is made by
   reducing its overall error through random mass participation. The
   development of social networks and their argumentative function in
   disputes have contributed to the transition to the concepts of
   argumentative networks that ensure the correct option is selected
   through communication. The identified dynamics allow us to conclude that
   the concept of politics is reviving its importance as a reasoning},

Abstract = {In Palestine, the eradication of the Indigenous population extends
   beyond physical displacement and destruction; it entails ecological
   transformations. Analogous to other settler -colonial contexts, nature
   is not merely annihilated; rather, it is molded to suit the colonizer's
   intentions, resulting in modification. This article examines the
   eco-resistance by the Indigenous people of Masafer Yatta as an
   Indigenous response to the environmental impact of the Israeli
   neocolonial entity. By delineating the tactics employed by settlers in
   the region to erase the Indigenous presence, the article aims to provide
   a comprehensive analysis of colonial dominance over Indigenous lives and
   knowledge across multiple scales. This analysis is grounded in extensive
   field immersion spanning from 2016 to 2022. The article addresses
   critical questions: How does Indigenous resistance manifest in the
   Masafer Yatta region? What strategies have Israeli settlers implemented
   on the ground to supplant the Indigenous population in the area? How
   does settler colonial dominance intersect with macro -economic
   dimensions and policies? While these questions have been explored within
   Palestine Studies scholarship and literature, this analysis is
   distinctive in its reliance on the specific case of Masafer Yatta. This
   area has received limited scholarly attention to date.},

   context of the city of Madrid and the conditions that facilitated their
   development, considering social innovation as a phenomenon dependent on
   the trajectory of the territories where it is located. Through the case
   study of the associative phenomenon in the Aluche neighborhood (Latina

   Network initiative and the explanatory factors of its emergence and
   development are explored, with special attention to the issue of citizen

Title = {The Geoeconomic Turn in EU Trade and Investment Policy: Implications for
   Developing Countries},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {The so-called geoeconomic turn in global trade policy-making has changed
   the context in which the European Union positions itself as a trade
   actor. However, there is little scholarly attention paid to how the
   geoeconomic turn affects the EU's relations with developing countries.
   This article analyses the potential implications of new EU autonomous
   trade and investment instruments for developing countries, and how the
   EU has taken these consequences into account when designing them. We
   rely on a combination of desk research of official documents, trade
   data, and secondary literature complemented with expert interviews. We
   find that a trade-off between geoeconomic and development objectives is
   more pertinent in sustainability-related than in competitiveness- and
   security-oriented instruments. In these sustainability instrum-despite
   some proposals having been made. The geoeconomic turn has thus made it
   more difficult to align the different objectives in the EU's trade and
   investment policies, and development concerns are sometimes relegated to
   the background.},

Abstract = {Do citizens reveal their valid preferences when asked about a potential
   foreign threat? This study presents the results of two list experiments
   implemented in Taiwan, a democratic and independently ruled island that
   leaders in China have long vowed to reunify with the mainland. Our two
   experiments-conducted in March 2019 and September 2021-focus on the
   percentage of Taiwanese who perceive China as a ``friend{''} and those
   who regard China as an ``enemy.{''} The findings reveal that, first, the
   proportion of Taiwanese citizens who harbored hostile feelings toward
   China grew by 30\% points between the two dates. In comparison, those
   with a more friendly perception of China declined by 18\% points.
   Second, we detected significant misreporting or preference falsification
   when comparing the list experiment estimates with answers to a direct
   question. Third, we found evidence that the hypothesized
   China-ambivalent respondents are most likely to have switched their
   perceptions of China.},

Abstract = {How do voters respond to a co-partisan political candidate after hearing
   about a serious scandal? We apply qualitative content analysis to
   open-ended text responses collected from survey respondents, focusing on
   159 respondents who remain willing to vote for a hypothetical male
   candidate after learning that allegations of sexual harassment against
   him were settled out of court. We uncover two main strategies by which
   respondents explained and justified their willingness to look past the
   misconduct allegations. The dominant strategy was to extend moral
   licence to the candidate based on his prior good deeds; a second
   prominent strategy was to disbelieve and reject the allegations. Our
   findings offer new insights on why some political candidates and careers
   appear untroubled by even serious allegations of misconduct, and frames
   new research avenues on which voters might be more likely to extend
   moral licence and in what circumstances.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {In recent years the `cost of governing' has significantly increased for
   some mainstream political parties. In a context of financial
   uncertainty, multiple crises and growing constraints exerted by global
   forces, being a `natural' party of government is no longer regarded as
   an electoral advantage. This is particularly true for parties that have
   moved from a position of clear dominance within ruling coalitions to a
   more subordinate role. In this article, focusing on the Social
   Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and using an original dataset, we aim
   to provide a more nuanced assessment of the effects of incumbency by
   examining regional electoral performance since 1990. It appears that
   sub-national incumbency can be beneficial in regional elections,
   especially when a party faces significant costs of governing at the
   national level. However, this advantage is only applicable if the party
   holds a leading position in the regional executive. On the contrary,
   being a junior coalition partner at both national and regional levels
   may further exacerbate electoral decline for the party.},

Abstract = {Chinese Outward Foreign Direct Investment (OFDI) has emerged as a
   significant driver of economic interactions between China and Africa,
   particularly within the digital transformation framework. This study
   investigates the relationship between Chinese OFDI, digital
   transformation, and economic growth across 41 African countries from
   2005 to 2020. Using robust econometric methods-Panel-Corrected Standard
   Errors (PCSE), System Generalized Method of Moments (System GMM), fixed
   effects, and Quantile regression-the analysis identifies key findings:
   Chinese OFDI has a positive and significant impact on advancing digital
   transformation in Africa. Furthermore, while the standalone
   contributions of Chinese OFDI and digital transformation to economic
   growth are limited, their combined effect is substantial, revealing a
   complementary relationship. This synergy suggests that improvements in
   local digital infrastructure enhance the productivity of Chinese
   investments, accelerating digital progress through infrastructure
   development and skill transfer. The study underscores the need for
   targeted Chinese investments and African policy reforms to leverage this
   relationship, offering actionable insights for promoting sustainable
   economic growth in a digitally evolving landscape.},

Title = {Fragmented and Dealigned: The 2024 British General Election and the Rise

Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {96},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {While the outcome of the 2024 British general election signalled a
   resounding repudiation of the incumbent government-returning a 231-seat
   swing from the Conservatives to Labour-it did not radically overturn the
   geography of electoral outcomes in England and Wales. Indeed,
   demographic predictors of party vote for parliamentary constituencies at
   the aggregate level mostly represented a continuation of recent trends.
   With the Conservative Party's vote collapsing most in areas where it
   started highest-and where the Leave vote had been highest in 2016-Labour
   secured shock victories in relatively affluent parts of southern England
   as well as retaking all the `red wall' constituencies in northern
   England that it lost in 2019, despite its national vote share only
   increasing slightly. This represented the other end of the `realignment'
   observed in 2019: as the electoral tide went out on the Conservatives,
   the relative weakening of their support in areas with graduates, middle
   class professionals and mortgage holders came home to roost. The
   election exposed a fragmented and marginal map, bequeathing a fragile
   electoral future, despite the Starmer government's large parliamentary
   majority.},

Title = {Civil Organizing in War: Evidence from Syrian Facebook Communities},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 26},
Abstract = {Where, when, and why do civilians organize during war? We propose a
   research agenda that expands the scope of variation in civil organizing
   and identify mechanisms to explain its emergence and evolution. Drawing
   on a large-scale original dataset of public Facebook posts produced by
   Syrian organizations from 2011 to 2020 and qualitative case studies
   based on 10 months of field research among Syrian activists in Turkey
   and Jordan, we systematically examine geographic, temporal, and
   substantive variation in civil organizing. We fi nd that civil
   organizing can persist in the face of ongoing violence and displacement,
   focusing not only on concerns of protection and survival, but also on
   governance and even contentious politics. This organizing increasingly
   shifts from within Syria to border states, with translocal
   organizations-operating both inside and outside Syria-playing a
   particularly active role. This work contributes to literature on
   conflict processes and contentious politics by emphasizing the
   importance of organizations, centering refugees and civilians as
   agential and strategic actors, and using novel evidence to describe
   variation in wartime organizing over time and space.},

Title = {Data Sovereignty and Development: How do Native Americans View Data
   Sharing by Tribal Governments?},

Abstract = {The Indigenous data sovereignty movement has arisen out of the ambition
   of Indigenous peoples to benefit from data-informed policy while
   preventing extractive and harmful research practices by external
   governments or researchers. Tribes exercise the sovereign authority to
   choose whether and when to share data with researchers and institutions
   outside their communities. To provide insight into how Indigenous
   peoples feel about data sharing, we document meaningful variation in a
   unique, nationwide survey of Native Americans. We find that respondents
   support their tribes in sharing data for economic benefit and that those
   who vote in tribal elections are particularly supportive. As tribal
   leaders, Native communities, and external research partners address
   potentially harmful data gaps and build Indigenous data resources, our
   findings suggest the importance of carefully considering and
   communicating the purpose of data collection and sharing. Broad benefit
   to Indigenous peoples' economic well-being is one factor that likely
   increases support for data sharing.},

Abstract = {How do societies navigate the symbolic and artistic heritage of troubled
   pasts? I build on Bernhard and Kubik's (2014) theorization of official
   memory regimes to demonstrate how memory regimes govern the public
   mnemonic space beyond the official level. I trace such governance within
   what Bernhard and Kubik call a unified memory regime, in which official
   actors prefer not to fight battles in and around memory. I argue that
   unified memory regimes order, discipline, and govern not only the
   official but also the everyday spaces of judgment and affection. Posited
   on unity at the official level, these hegemonic frames of meaning-making
   relegate mnemonic tension to the societal level where discursive battles
   continue to take place. I further argue that unified memory regimes can
   open pitfalls for pluralists during moments of mnemonic contestation.
   Because pluralists acknowledge and agonistically deliberate on multiple
   interpretations of the past, they may attempt to discursively reconcile
   the emerging societal-level mnemonic fracture with the official unified
   memory regime. But this strategy can backfire, reinforcing the unified
   regime and disciplining the societal-level challenger through three
   discursive practices that I call the traps of consensus: semantic
   alignment, a syntax of disavowal, and the juxtaposition of
   ``universal{''} and ``particular{''} narratives about the past.
   Pluralists may be especially vulnerable to these traps when they face
   unified memory regimes in which the consensus narrative appears
   superficially pluralist (or ``underspecified{''}) because it eschews
   normative judgments that distinguish between perpetrators and victims. I
   illustrate these dynamics through tracing the case of a contested
   soundscape in postcommunist Albania.},

Abstract = {Understanding how institutions shape outcomes is an important skill for
   students of American political science. Simulations in which students
   participate in mock elections structured by real-world institutions can
   serve as an effective tool to aid students' learning. This article
   describes a model for a simulated 2020 Democratic Iowa caucus. Following
   official procedures, students engage in debates about which candidate to
   support and ultimately come to a final decision for their simulated
   precinct. The simulation helps students to understand the institutions
   that structure Iowa's caucuses and assists them in forming conclusions
   about the strengths and weaknesses of those institutions. This
   simulation was implemented in a course on political parties and
   elections in the Spring 2023 semester, where it proved to be an
   enjoyable exercise for students. It was reimplemented in the Spring 2024
   semester as one of several simulated presidential nominations, and it
   proved to be a helpful teaching tool.},

Abstract = {Many argue that, given the all-subjected principle, non-temporary
   immigrants should have access to citizenship, challenging differences in
   rights between denizens and citizens. This article reassesses this
   conclusion by examining the case for a pathway to citizenship for
   denizens and asking whether former denizens, now citizens, can be denied
   some rights existing citizens have. It reconstructs Hart's distinction
   between general and special rights, demonstrating with reference to Kant
   how the special right to political citizenship stems from general
   rights. This elucidates why denizens are entitled to a path to political
   citizenship. The article further explores how the exercise of
   citizenship can lead to additional special rights, scrutinizing whether
   these must also accrue to new citizens. It discusses conditions under
   which these further special rights might justify a distinction between
   citizens. The conclusion argues that reserving certain rights for some
   citizens is interesting for rethinking democratic theory in light of
   increasing mobility, less for justifying different rights for citizens
   and former denizens.},

Abstract = {Conjoint experiments have enabled scholars to understand the preferences
   of citizens in a variety of political contexts. We propose a method to
   modify the standard text-only ``box conjoint{''} to make the treatment
   higher in external validity with respect to a common target context.
   Citizens frequently encounter political information encoded as images
   and in particular in the form of politicians' social media posts and
   profiles. We deploy ``visual conjoint{''} experiments where subjects
   select between two images that encode the same explicit information as
   is standard in the box conjoint. We conduct an experiment in which we
   randomize the modality of a conjoint experiment where subjects evaluate
   the Twitter profiles of hypothetical candidates. We demonstrate that the
   visual conjoint more effectively encodes image-based information and
   social endorsement information. The visual conjoint also allows the
   salience of different attributes to vary naturally the way they do on
   social media, in contrast to the artificially enforced uniformity of the
   box conjoint.},

Month = {DEC-APR},
Abstract = {The text discusses Jurgen Habermas's reception of Carl Schmitt's work,
   generating controversies in interpretations from thinkers like Chantal
   Mouffe and Ellen Kennedy. Mouffe criticizes Habermas's reading as
   ``completely erroneous,{''} while Kennedy suggests the evident presence
   of ``Schmittism{''} in Habermas. This debate originates from Kennedy's
   1984 conference, after which Habermas titled his work ``Carl Schmitt:
   The Terrors of Autonomy.{''} Habermas, initially averse to liberalism,
   according to Kennedy, evolves towards a stage of ``last Habermas,{''}
   marked by a ``post-secular turn.{''} Habermas's analysis focuses on
   three pairs of Schmittian notions: ``the political{''} and political
   theology, secularization and neutralization, and the Leviathan and
   privatization of religion. Habermas criticizes Schmitt's view on
   secularization, arguing that depoliticization gestated before liberal
   revolutions. Additionally, he highlights the importance of the
   nominalist revolution in shaping modernity and criticizes secularist
   self-understanding, advocating for a genealogy that includes learning
   and expansion processes.},

Month = {2024 NOV 29},
Abstract = {The objective of this study is to assess the two-way relationship
   between the level of public sector digital governance and corruption in
   a sample of African countries. We use a multilevel mixed-effects
   regression model on data from the World Bank and Transparency
   International between 2020 and 2022. Previous literature has evaluated
   the effect of government digitization on institutional quality. However,
   because of the high level of corruption in African countries, this study
   is the first to also assess the effect of corruption on the development
   of digitized public governance systems. The results show that the
   development of digital governance has a significantly negative
   bidirectional relationship with corruption. All the digital governance
   indices have a negative relationship with the level of corruption.
   Despite this, corruption does not significantly affect the quality of
   the digital public service allocated and citizens' commitment to using
   digital procedures.},

Abstract = {The case method has increasingly become one of the most popular active
   learning techniques. However, empirical research on its effectiveness is
   predominantly focused on business fields in Western countries and is
   typically assessed using a few learning outcomes, with little
   consideration for students' individual characteristics. This paper
   provides new empirical insights by examining the effect of various
   factors on Japanese students' acquisition of knowledge and vital
   meta-skills in Politics and Law courses. Based on a survey conducted at
   a Japanese university, our analysis finds that students' stress levels
   and interest in the course subject have a statistically significant
   impact on the acquisition of knowledge and all meta-skills. Other
   factors, such as experience, course preparation, and personality affect
   the acquisition of knowledge and some meta-skills.},

Abstract = {Although most local elections are officially nonpartisan, a debate
   exists regarding how much ideology matters in local politics. I test the
   effects of national polarization toward policing at the local level
   using a conjoint survey experiment and novel observational data. I find
   that police union endorsements send clear ideological signals about
   mayoral candidates to voters and voters respond accordingly: liberal
   (conservative) respondents are significantly less (more) likely to vote
   for police union-endorsed candidates. I create a new dataset of police
   union endorsements in every mayoral election in American cities with
   populations above 180,000 between 2011 and 2022. I find police union
   endorsements have significant negative effects on incumbent vote share
   in liberal cities at the same time as polarization occurs nationally.
   This evidence suggests that when national politics polarize on a local
   issue, ideology becomes an important component in local politics and
   that police union endorsements now inform about local candidate
   ideology.},

Title = {`The Kingdom of Hay-on-Wye': football, nationalism, and national
   identity in a Welsh border town},
Journal = {NATIONAL IDENTITIES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {319-339},
Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {This article examines the intricate layers of identity in Hay-on-Wye, a
   Welsh border town that symbolizes both cultural distinctiveness and
   national ambiguity. Through ethnographic research, it explores how
   residents negotiate Welsh, English, and British identities within a
   landscape shaped by Hay's unique history, geography, and civic
   mythology. Known for its self-proclaimed ``independence{''} as the
   ``Kingdom of Hay{''} and for its internationally renowned literary
   festival, the town has a rich narrative of local pride. The study
   foregrounds the role of sport, specifically Hay St. Mary's Football
   Club, in reflecting and mediating local identity within the context of
   devolved Wales. Figures like Richard Booth, the town's self-styled
   ``King,{''} have further shaped Hay's identity, blending notions of
   community, nationalism, and myth. By investigating how local identities

Abstract = {As students have become more career-oriented, it has become increasingly
   challenging to recruit them into political science, since connections
   between the major and many potential job opportunities are not
   immediately apparent. Consequently, departments are seeing declining
   numbers in majors. To counter this trend, departments need to identify
   new strategies to recruit students into our major. This work examines
   strategies and opportunities for recruitment of both prospective college
   students and current students from other majors. We also address
   strategies for current students, including introducing a cohort model,
   creating a departmental community, and making the work that we do more
   visible.},

Abstract = {Sarcastic remarks and hilarious gestures were evident throughout the
   Northern Ireland peace process. However, was there anything behind this?
   Why were these humourous remarks being made? What role did humour have
   in communicating throughout the Northern Ireland peace process? This
   article argues that humour played a role in the Northern Ireland peace
   process in four primary ways, in (i) initiating contacts and meetings,
   (ii) developing relationships and confidence building, (iii)
   demonstrating solidarity and defusing situations, and (iv) expressing
   frustrations and objections. Furthermore, in the post-conflict context
   humour has been utilised when reflecting on the Northern Ireland peace
   process.},

Abstract = {Research identifies numerous factors associated with citizens'
   perceptions of party ideologies, including the Left-Right orientations
   of parties' election manifestos, governing coalition arrangements, and
   media reports of party elites' interactions. We analyze whether
   citizens' reliance on these factors varies with their levels of
   education and political knowledge. In analyses of 50 election surveys
   from 18 countries between 2002 and 2015, we find that more politically
   sophisticated citizens attach (modestly) more weight to parties'
   election manifestos and media reports of political elites' interactions,
   but no evidence that sophistication moderates citizens' reactions to
   governing coalition arrangements. There thus appears to be far more
   homogeneity than heterogeneity in the structure of party placement
   perceptions.},

Abstract = {Do voters who dislike the other side prefer candidates who can win, even
   if they are less representative? Negative partisanship is an important
   feature of American politics, but few scholars have examined its
   relationship to voter decision-making. We argue that negative
   partisanship shapes how voters prioritize candidate electability and
   substantive representation. Using two conjoint experiments, we find that
   a primary candidate's likelihood of beating the opposing party in the
   general election has a strong influence on whether they are chosen as a
   voter's strategic choice (who they would vote for) and sincere choice
   (who best represents their interests). Importantly, the effect of
   electability is conditional on voters' feelings toward the opposing
   party, but not their own party. Negative partisans are also more willing
   to trade greater ideological and policy representation for a better shot
   at electoral victory.},

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},

Abstract = {Far-right extremists use the internet to recruit and connect with other
   radicalised individuals and spread their propaganda online, with them
   being prolific users of online forums and social media. Such online data
   can be analysed using linguistic tools to identify markers of
   radicalisation in social media, forum posts, and other extremist texts.
   Few studies have examined how language and sentiment online evolves in
   extremist forums, which provides insight into how radicalisation into
   extremism unfolds overtime. To address this gap, we examine how the
   extremist language used by Australian members of the online far-right
   forum Iron March changed in relation to the level of engagement on the
   forum, as well as assessing whether any relationship existed between
   online extremist sentiment and offline violence. Forum data were
   computationally coded and analysed using the Grievance Dictionary, which
   is designed to identify psycholinguistic indicators of extremism.
   Results indicate that while extremist language changes over time, there
   was no support for the suggestion that greater forum engagement results
   in higher levels of extremist sentiment. The results found that a high
   level of online extremist sentiment is associated with offline violence.
   Findings are linked to existing literature, and limitations in the study
   design are acknowledged.},

Abstract = {The economic theory of voting has long remained a cornerstone in the
   study of voting behaviour, especially in economically developed
   democracies. At the heart of it is the assumption that economic contexts
   shape voting choice and influence electoral outcomes as management of
   the economy is an important function of governments and that citizens
   hold elected representatives accountable for the nation's as well as
   family's economic situation. Voters support ruling party candidates when
   they think the incumbent government has delivered on the economic
   front-creation of employment opportunities, keeping price of essential
   goods and services under control, rise in income across social layers
   and so on. In India, much of the analysis of voting behaviour is focused
   on shifting allegiance of support across social
   constituencies-particularly caste and religion. Economic factors of
   voting choices have received little attention to the extent as if they
   do not matter. However, analysis of NES (2024) data suggests that
   economic factors swayed a significant chunk of voters and thus
   influenced the final electoral outcomes. Anchored in economic
   theoretical context of voting behaviour, this article particularly
   examines whether there was pocketbook voting and whether it influenced
   the electoral outcomes of the 18th general election to Lok Sabha (2024).
   The findings show that pocketbook voting had significant and substantial
   effect on political preference.},

Abstract = {Administrative burden refers to the phenomenon by which the
   implementation of public policies and, more generally, interactions with
   the state, are experienced as onerous. Individuals face learning costs
   when acquiring information about public programs and services,
   compliance costs when trying to fulfill their rules, and psychological
   costs (stress, etc.) arising from interacting with these programs and
   services. This literature, almost exclusively in English, has developed
   at a breathtaking pace. This review essay takes stock of these recent
   developments and proposes a discussion structured around three themes:
   1) What are administrative burdens and what issues do they raise? 2)
   What are the sources of burdens? and 3) What are their distributive and
   political consequences? Avenues for future research are suggested for
   each of these themes.},

Abstract = {There are two dominant explanations of contemporary Muslim voting
   behaviour. A section of public commentators reiterates an old argument
   that Muslims always participate in politics to defeat the BJP. This
   argument is not entirely incorrect. The BJP did not deviate from its
   Modi-centric Hindutva-driven campaign. The party relied heavily on an
   apparent anti-Muslim rhetoric to reach out to its core voters. The
   failure of the BJP to secure an absolute majority in Lok Sabha, in this
   sense, is also seen as an obvious outcome of this strategy. It is
   claimed that the BJP's attempt to polarize voters on religious grounds
   encouraged Muslims to vote for non-BJP candidates throughout the
   country.The second explanation is more speculative. The INDIA alliance
   has so far tried to avoid any discussion on the overwhelming Muslim
   support they have received this time. The non-BJP parties, except a few,
   do not want to publicly acknowledge the fact that their success was
   almost impossible without active Muslim support. This kind of political
   reluctance is justified as a strategic silence. There is an assumption
   that the pro-Muslim gestures of these parties will make the Hindu voters
   unhappy.Findings of National Election Studies (NES) 2024 take us beyond
   these popular descriptions of Muslim voting. This survey introduces us
   to the complexities of contemporary Muslim politics and its electoral
   manifestations. This article tries to establish a link between Muslim
   self-perceptions as a religious minority in India and their political
   behaviour. We ask three basic questions: First, did Muslim communities
   vote more actively this time than Hindu communities? Second, did they
   vote as a homogeneous community or as a vote bank? And finally, did they
   vote basically to defeat BJP?},

Abstract = {The practice of International Relations (IR) in India dates back to the
   1950s and the establishment of the Indian School of International
   Studies (ISIS). Despite an early start, IR in India struggled to
   establish itself as a discipline due to domestic and institutional
   issues. Prominent criticisms of Indian IR include a lack of
   methodological rigour, an absence of theory, and low contributions to
   high-ranking journals. While engagement with questions of
   post-colonialism and decolonization is not new to IR, its impact on
   India continues to be limited. This essay explores the issues and
   challenges associated with the practice of IR in India by taking a
   de-parochial and decolonial outlook. I argue that IR in India developed
   as a received discourse from the West with little to no engagement with
   India's past, statist assumptions, and imperial underpinnings of the
   discipline.},

Abstract = {Although exclusion is often perceived as antithetical to civil society,
   many feminist activists advocate for excluding men from their spaces to
   prevent conflicts and create safer environments. This tension prompts a
   deeper exploration of exclusion's role in civic engagement. This study
   aims to examines the role of exclusion in feminist digital activism
   through a textual analysis of how members of an online Chinese feminist
   community promote exclusion. The findings challenge traditional
   perspectives by suggesting that exclusion can be a crucial tool for
   feminists to participate in civic life, protect their rights, and assert
   their agency. This study also reveals that exclusion plays a significant
   role in the ongoing formation of feminist identity. While the exclusion
   of men may initially appear to reinforce binary gender norms, it can
   also serve as a catalyst for exploring and embracing the fluidity of
   gender and political identity.},

Title = {Who counts in civically engaged research? Rethinking expertise and
   authority in politics},
Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 6},
Abstract = {Calls for political science and related disciplines to inform public
   debates and contribute to public policy have proliferated in recent
   years. Scholars increasingly work with high-level policymakers and top
   government agencies, international organizations, private foundations,
   and corporations. This article highlights the need to broaden the
   mainstream of public and policy-facing work, putting local communities
   at the center of research and research-policy relations. To demonstrate
   the importance of putting communities first in civically engaged
   research (CER), we put forward a conceptual framework that takes stock
   of problems associated with the traditional research process as well as
   with narrow engagements with elite actors. Through illustrative
   vignettes, we show how CER is uniquely positioned to disrupt these
   dynamics and amplify the expertise within communities that are directly
   connected with, and impacted by, research and research-policy relations.
   We argue that an understanding of research problems that aligns with the
   perspectives of communities, and the incorporation of local and
   contextually nuanced insights, is essential for equalizing and
   localizing the benefits of research to participants and broader
   communities, and for generating better scholarship and better policy.},

Abstract = {Political (as opposed to professional) election oversight is one area in
   which the U.S. scores extremely low in measures of election integrity.
   Meanwhile, rancorous political battles to determine acceptable election
   procedures and judge when tactics cross the line have become common
   events. Our work contributes to recent scholarship investigating whether
   voters prioritize democratic principles or strategically favor electoral
   procedures that provide partisan advantage. In two survey experiments,
   we confirm that Americans' attitudes about antidemocratic election
   tactics reveal more about which team they are cheering for than they do
   about whether the tactics are fraudulent. The tendency to engage in
   partisan motivated reasoning occurs among all partisans, but there are
   subtle differences as to when citizens will engage in it. Partisan
   motivated reasoning is more common when actions cause harm and by the
   partisans that are harmed. Finally, Independents are more impartial, but
   less likely to call out improper tactics in the aggregate because they
   often fail to condemn actions by either party.},

Abstract = {This article uses data from the 2021 Scottish Election Study to apply
   both established and relatively rare or unique approaches to
   understanding the interrelationships between personal national
   identities, attitudes regarding the (Scottish) nation and independence,
   and people's own/family migration histories. Analysis broadly
   substantiates previous research in Scotland on the effects of
   birthplace, parentage and length of residence on national identities,
   and similarly highlights that previously established ` non-alignment'
   between national identities and position on Scottish independence
   extends to how the latter is associated with personal and family
   migration histories. The paper also makes at least three distinctive
   contributions. First, it highlights the significance of socialisation in
   Scotland, particularly in early childhood, for migrants' personal
   national identities and attitudes to Scottish nationhood and
   independence. Second, it suggests only limited variation in the degree
   to which personal biographical characteristics are associated with
   perceptions that Scotland has distinct values compared to other parts of
   the UK. Third, it demonstrates that social connections to England via
   birthplace, family and/or prior residence do not invariably affect
   national identities and attitudes to Scottish independence, but that
   those with the strongest associations to England are substantially less
   likely to prioritise a Scottish identity or support Scottish
   independence.},

   Readings of Security and Freedom from Agamben and Spinoza},

Abstract = {This paper reflects on Agamben's perspective on governmental responses
   to the pandemic and argues that Spinoza's thought can offer a different
   alternative to the Italian philosopher's conceptualisation. It is
   divided into two sections: the first focuses on Agamben, exploring his
   notion of homo sacer, his ontology and his vision of the state. The
   second deals with Spinoza, analysing freedom and security, concepts
   interrelated with the state. It is argued that, while in Agamben freedom
   and security are antithetical, in Spinoza they can be complementary.
   This relationship suggests that some exceptional measures adopted by
   governments do not necessarily threaten freedom but can be seen as a
   means of preserving and securing it.},

Abstract = {The present text seeks, counter to prevailing trends, to explore an
   approximation between the philosophies of Hegel and Deleuze. The core of
   this connection can be found in their respective ontologies, developed
   in The Science of Logic and Difference and Repetition, respectively. The
   aim is to rearticulate the relationship between contingency and
   necessity, especially in Hegel. This is due to the fact that hegemonic
   readings of this author excessively focus on necessity, relegating
   contingency to a secondary role. A new reading of the contingent nature
   of necessity in Hegel could bring this author closer to the French
   philosopher who so often criticized the German idealist.},

   performance in contemporary China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 1},
Abstract = {This study explores the factors that affect Chinese political identity.
   Although the Chinese government claims that maintaining the traditional
   Confucian political heritage represented by the Great Harmony Society
   ((sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)) and common prosperity is its main source of
   political legitimacy, this study found that for the majority of Chinese
   people, their support for the Chinese government is not based on the
   government's Confucian political heritage, but rather on the
   government's National Accountability system and national-oriented
   ideology, For individuals, supporting the state is an unconditional
   moral requirement, even if the state's performance is not good, so
   Chinese people have higher political satisfaction. This ideology
   encourages the state to restrain freedom of the people in the form of
   omnipotence, and is also responsible for meeting all the needs of the
   people. This study suggests that China's thousands of years of
   centralized political tradition and the inertia of large government have
   made the people more accustomed to an omnipotent government. The
   governance of the Chinese government is also a model of external
   Confucianism and internal law((sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)), with Confucian
   political heritage as the surface propaganda, but the internal system is
   centralized.},

Abstract = {Among political institutions in the United States, state courts are
   surprisingly susceptible to ideological extremism because of the
   non-uniform ways judges are selected. In this paper we examine the
   effect of selection methods on the ideological composition of state
   supreme courts. We theorize that methods involving partisan politics
   lead to more ideological justices and that, among that subset,
   Republican affiliated justices will be the most extreme. We test our
   expectations using a dataset of over 600 state supreme court selections
   between 1961-2011. Using a contemporary matching algorithm designed to
   maximize causal identification, we find support for our hypotheses. Our
   results speak to the consequences of federalism in court composition and
   offer an insight into how polarization manifests in the judiciary.},

Abstract = {The `Heralds of the Gospel' are a Brazilian ultra-Catholic group with a
   long history of far-right lobbying and activism. Recognized in 2001 by
   the Vatican as `International Private Association of Christ's
   Faithfull', they are also `of Pontifical right' and since 2005 allowed
   to ordinate their own priests. As ``soldiers of Christ{''} they are
   inspired by the Templars and pursue a utopian mission to subvert,
   transform and ultimately overturn the modern, secular state through
   their apostolate. The Heralds have also created an international
   education network and media imperium, underpinned by a robust business
   model, and are starting to reach out to the US and Europe. The article
   argues that this kind of exotic, Catholic far-right utopianism matters
   if we are to understand the diversity of the global new right today, in
   particular because the Brazilian tradition, which the Heralds refer to,
   anticipated some of the by now recurrent elements of this strand of the
   right such as metapolitics and antimodernism. The article explores the
   century long (neo)integrist tradition that the Heralds grow out of and
   through their own publications, PR and leaked evidence, show how this
   tradition is brought to life in the 21st century as communitarian
   practices and material artifacts.},

Title = {Analyzing violent attacker texts: examining ideologies through machine
   learning-assisted topic modeling},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 22},
Abstract = {The rise in extremist violence is a global concern, prompting
   advancements in threat assessment. This study applies machine learning
   to dissect publicly available texts from violent attackers with white
   supremacist, incel, and political extremist ideologies, as well as from
   those driven by personal grievances. Through natural language
   processing, the research identifies specific linguistic patterns and
   themes inherent to each group and explores the intersections among them.
   It uncovers shared narratives of disenfranchisement and aggression
   alongside unique ideological signifiers. Additionally, it identifies
   themes unique to each group, offering a clear thematic distinction
   between ideologies. These insights contribute to a more accurate
   identification of radicalization indicators, supporting the development
   of intervention strategies tailored to the ideological nuances of each
   group. Enhanced threat assessment tools informed by this research can
   improve the precision of prevention efforts by law enforcement and
   mental health professionals, reflecting the complex realities of
   extremist motivations and actions.},

Abstract = {Many contemporary researchers agree that group relative deprivation is a
   driver of political actions against outgroups. However, both relative
   deprivation and political actions are complex phenomena, making it
   important to further study this relationship in the context of other
   relevant variables. One such variable could be the specific outgroup.
   The purpose of our study was to evaluate differences in the contribution
   of group relative deprivation to the prediction of activist and
   radicalised intentions against two outgroups - Muslims and senior
   citizens. The multi-group structural equation modelling was applied
   separately on nationally representative samples of youth from Germany (N
   = 1,056), Norway (N = 376) and the United Kingdom (UK) (N = 1053). Group
   relative deprivation exhibited a robust relationship with activist
   intentions after controlling for general aggression, social desirability
   bias, age and gender, except in the UK, where the relationship between
   activist intentions and relative deprivation was stronger with Muslims
   as the target outgroup. The relationship between relative deprivation
   and radicalised intentions depended on the target outgroup across
   countries - it was related to radicalised intentions only against
   Muslims. The meaning and implications of these results are briefly
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Why do religious-based parties in Muslim-majority contexts win when they
   run in elections as incumbents? Does Islamist advantage make them
   appealing to voters? The sources of Islamist advantage such as their
   organizations, services, images, and being a refuge are well-documented.
   However, the literature primarily focuses on contexts where
   religious-based parties compete under adverse conditions as opposition
   actors, rather than as incumbents facing more favorable conditions.
   Through an innovative conjoint experiment in Turkey using candidate
   videos, we explore the extent of Islamist advantage arguments. Our
   findings suggest that the universal Islamist advantage, by which
   Islamists appeal to broader segments, disappears under Islamist
   incumbency because Islamists can no longer appeal through those sources
   of Islamist advantage as incumbents. Instead, Islamists may still win
   due to two factors: incumbency advantage and a persisting
   particularistic Islamist advantage, driven by increasing spatial voting.
   Our findings provide evidence for a frequently proposed, yet
   unsubstantiated, claim about the extent of Islamist advantage.},

Abstract = {The electoral growth of Sinn Fein on both sides of the Irish border has
   generated much political and academic attention in recent years. The
   party could form part of the government in Dublin for the first time at
   the next Irish general election, though that outcome is far from
   certain. If it were to gain power, Sinn Fein is likely to pursue
   policies which address the core socioeconomic issues its new supporters
   south of the border are concerned with, namely housing and healthcare.
   It will also be expected to push for an Irish unification referendum in
   the coming decade. While Sinn Fein entering government would clearly
   constitute a seismic event in the politics of the Irish state, there
   would also be knock-on effects for politics in Northern Ireland, as well
   as British-Irish and EU-Irish relations. This article examines the
   impact Sinn Fein gaining power in Dublin could have on these various
   political dynamics, arguing the party exerts a unique influence on
   Irish, UK and European politics.},

Title = {What do lawmakers understand by `public transparency'? A longitudinal
   study of Brazil's legislative production},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {46},
Number = {4},
Pages = {477-497},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study aims to examine which conceptions of public transparency are
   present in bills of law introduced to the Brazilian House of
   Representatives. By combining content and document analysis to
   investigate 357 drafts proposed between 2003 and 2018, we scrutinize how
   often lawmakers propose transparency policies, what arguments and
   reasons they more recurrently use, the extent to which authoring
   proposals on public transparency is associated with their respective
   party ideologies, and the main characteristics of those bills passed
   into law. The findings reveal what we can be described as an
   `unproductive hyperactivity' since the significant number of projects
   under consideration at the House usually adds little to existing
   transparency policies. In addition, the justifications underpinning many
   of the bills are marked by criticism toward political adversaries or
   evince the corporatist defense of lawmakers' private interests -
   underlining the persistence of corruption and patrimonialism as
   characteristics of the Brazilian political culture.},

Abstract = {What are the psychological mechanisms of racial ``dog whistles{''} in
   American politics? Literature on race priming in American politics
   argues when race is primed implicitly, racial biases influence political
   evaluations, but when race is made salient, individuals can use
   controlled processing to inhibit automatic biases and abide by
   egalitarian norms. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these
   processes have yet to be examined directly. In a 2 x 2 within-groups
   experiment using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examine these
   neural mechanisms. We find brain areas associated with conflict
   detection, evaluative processing, and controlled processing are more
   active when race is primed explicitly rather than implicitly, as
   expected, although we do not find substantial brain activation
   associated with automatic responses to be more active during implicit
   than explicit primes. Results are discussed in terms of understanding
   how racial cues influence political evaluations while considering
   America's ever-changing racial norms.},

Title = {Toward abortion decriminalization: Irish abortion activism and the power
   of legal ambivalence},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {40},

Pages = {51-75},

Abstract = {This article explores the role of feminist legal ambivalence in Irish
   abortion activism, arguing for its continued relevance after the repeal
   of the Eighth Amendment. Legal ambivalence, which involves a combination
   of skepticism and engagement with the law, has long been a feature of
   feminist theory due to the law's role in maintaining patriarchal norms.
   In the context of Irish abortion advocacy, this ambivalence has provided
   strategic advantages. Early resistance from the Irish Church and State
   led activists to approach legal reforms with caution, fostering a
   productive ambivalence that facilitated actions such as accessing
   abortions abroad and employing art-based protests. The article outlines
   how this nuanced stance toward the law evolved over time, benefiting
   feminist and reproductive rights activism. It argues that Irish abortion
   advocates should capitalize on this history by advocating for the full
   decriminalization of abortion. This strategy, the article suggests,
   carries symbolic power, has been proven advantageous in other countries,
   and is both pragmatic and feasible in Ireland. Ultimately, the article
   calls for a continued embrace of legal ambivalence as a tool to
   challenge restrictive laws and advance reproductive freedom.},

Title = {Access to justice through electronic lawsuits in Mexicos},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Number = {41},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Access to justice through electronic means promises to bring justice to
   citizens. Nonetheless, it is not sufficient for judiciaries to have
   platforms for online judicial proceedings if they are not used. Research
   on online trials with statistical support is scarce. There is a platform
   that enables the electronic filing of lawsuits before Mexican courts
   from any part of the world with internet connectivity. Therefore, this
   article analyses the use of electronic lawsuits nationwide and at a
   state level of the Mexican Republic from 2019 to 2023 and the
   correlation between Gross Domestic Product per capita of professional,
   scientific and technical services (PIBsp-SPCyT). With official data, 1)
   the analyses are made with regards to the evolution by 100 thousand
   persons, by the proportion of all the filed lawsuits, and in connection
   with the compound annual growth rate, and 2) the correlation and impact
   of the electronic lawsuits and their impact in connection with
   PIBsp-SPCyT is presented. Findings include a constant increase in the
   use of electronic lawsuits due to several factors and a direct
   correlation between PIBsp-SPCyT and the electronic filing of lawsuits.},

Abstract = {How does Congress identify issues of sufficient concern to warrant
   consideration? Since the late nineteenth century, bill sponsorship by
   individual members has been the primary mechanism for winnowing the
   uncountable set of ideas for change to a finite agenda. Previous
   scholarship emphasizes electoral considerations and members' policy
   goals as motivating factors; however, the scant evidence for significant
   electoral returns to bill sponsorship raises questions about whether
   constituency concerns influence legislators' attention. We present a
   theory of bill sponsorship as constituency-minded policy-seeking
   activity and test its predictions using an original data set of bills
   introduced in the House of Representatives between 1881 and 1931. Using
   event count models and Monte Carlo simulations, we find that
   constituency concerns directly affect legislators' attention and
   indirectly influence bill sponsorship through committee assignments.
   These findings from a period when bill sponsorship was expansive and
   resource intensive illuminate how electoral factors and resource-based
   concerns shape legislative performance.},

Title = {Do political finance reforms really reduce corruption? A replication
   study},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In their 2021 article published in the British Journal of Political
   Science, Calla Hummel, John Gerring, and Thomas Burt (henceforth Hummel
   et al.) examine the relationship between political finance reforms and
   corruption, concluding that state funding of political parties reduces
   corruption by diminishing reliance on private financing. Our replication
   study challenges this conclusion based on data accuracy and
   operationalization issues of their key explanatory variable - Political
   Finance Subsidy Index (PFSI) - and using alternative model
   specifications and regional subsamples. While our partial data
   corrections and re-coding do not significantly differ from the Hummel et
   al. findings, the substantial regional heterogeneity regarding public
   party funding - corruption relationship and the results' sensitivity to
   alternative modelling choices such as two-way fixed effects, country
   fixed effects, and time fixed effects, cast doubt on the reliability of
   their results. Our findings underscore the methodological challenges in
   assessing the effects of public funding reforms and emphasize the need
   for refined measurements and careful consideration of regional contexts.
   Although public funding may help combat corruption under specific
   institutional conditions, its effects are not universally consistent,
   calling for greater caution in deriving policy implications from
   cross-national analyses.},

Title = {International Business in Conflict Zones: The Case of MTN},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Number = {49},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {It is not uncommon for multinational companies to establish subsidiaries
   outside their home countries, especially in developing regions to tap
   into emerging markets. It is however a different situation when
   multinationals establish businesses in unstable and violence-affected
   regions to take advantage of the local market structure that has
   suffered a hit by the continuous conflict. However, running a business
   in such regions may lead to distortion of the administration of these
   firms due to the violence which may destroy infrastructure and harm
   employees. Many firms are discouraged from investing in conflict zones
   because of the exposure to insecurity and violence. This paper adopts a
   case study and case analysis approach with an in-depth focus on the
   operation of a specific company and its operations in two conflict zones
   which resulted in distinct outcomes. In addition, a review of existing
   literature on the establishment and operation of a business in conflict
   zones was carried out to effectively examine the challenges of
   litigation and conflict resolution involving MTN Group as a corporate
   entity in Afghanistan and Northeastern Nigeria and the impact on the
   business operations in the respective regions},

Abstract = {Contrary to dominant theories of postindustrial society, this article
   advances an alternative account of digital capitalism that repositions
   the factory-so often associated with industrial manufacturing-as a
   defining yet largely overlooked feature of the internet economy. I
   pursue this claim by interpreting data centers and microwork platforms
   as digital embodiments of the factory system through a historical theory
   of the factory model that reconstructs the consistent mechanisms of
   control and extraction that have distinguished factories as consolidated
   infrastructures of production since their inception. I define these
   ``protocols of production{''} as formal rules deployed by a combination
   of technological systems, spatial arrangements, and management regimes
   devised to fragment tasks, discipline workers, and supervise production.
   By probing the socioeconomic consequences of the factory's algorithmic
   redeployment and adaptation to global data production, I contend that
   these absent factories have amplified alienation and precarity as
   structural social qualities of the digital labor process.},

Abstract = {The Weather Underground is a group that has divided opinion for over
   half a century. To some, they were legitimate anti-war activists, to
   others they were one of America's most notorious domestic terror groups.
   Much of the secondary literature describing the group has highlighted
   the role of women in the organisation, differentiating them from the
   typical male-dominated structures of radical and extremist groups. Using
   comparative autobiographical analysis, this project explores the extent
   to which this assessment of gender equality is accurate by evaluating
   how members of the group described their experiences in their own words.
   The analysis identifies gendered discrepancies in the portrayal of women
   in the movement. Where men were likely to have a positive recollection
   of the gender equality within the Weather Underground, the accounts of
   women tread a complex line between acknowledging both the liberatory
   elements and the sexism within the movement. This research helps to
   demonstrate the value of first-hand accounts rather than secondary
   literature in trying to understand the internal dynamics of a movement.
   It also highlights the need for nuance when discussing the role of women
   in extremism movements.},

   councillors has been left largely unexplored in the party literature. We
   explore how this relationship varies within the case of Norway - a
   multi-party system with large variation in municipal size. Based on a
   survey of leaders of municipal party branches and local lists, as well
   as qualitative interviews with branch and list leaders, we analyse the
   causes of variation regarding two dependent variables: the degree of
   integration between the party branch and council group and the
   involvement of party branches in council work. The overall picture is
   that work in branches and council groups is strongly integrated.
   However, local branches of left-of-centre parties are likely to be more
   involved in council work and less likely to be fully integrated with
   their council groups. The left-of-centre tradition of giving more power
   to extra-parliamentary organisation seems to prevail.
   Die Beziehung zwischen lokalen Parteiorganisationen und Gemeinder \&
   auml;ten ist in der Parteienliteratur weitgehend unerforscht. Wir
   untersuchen Variation dieser Beziehung im Fall Norwegens, einem
   Mehrparteiensystem mit gro ss en Unterschieden in der Gemeindegr \&
   ouml;ss e. Basierend auf einer Befragung von F \& uuml;hrungskr \&
   auml;ften kommunaler Parteiverb \& auml;nde und lokaler Listen sowie
   qualitativen Interviews mit Verbands- und Listenf \& uuml;hrern
   analysieren wir die Ursachen der Variation hinsichtlich zweier abh \&
   auml;ngiger Variablen: dem Grad der Integration zwischen Partei und
   Gemeinderat sowie der Beteiligung der Parteigliederungen in der
   Gemeinderatsarbeit. Insgesamt ist die Arbeit in den Parteiverb \&
   auml;nden und Ratsgruppen stark integriert. Lokale Verb \& auml;nde
   linksgerichteter Parteien d \& uuml;rften jedoch st \& auml;rker in die
   Ratsarbeit eingebunden und weniger vollst \& auml;ndig in ihre
   Ratsfraktionen integriert sein. Die linksgerichtete Tradition, au ss
   erparlamentarischen Organisationen mehr Macht zu verleihen, scheint sich
   durchzusetzen.
   La relation entre l'organisation locale des partis et les conseillers
   locaux est rest \& eacute;e largement inexplor \& eacute;e dans la litt
   \& eacute;rature du parti. Nous explorons comment cette relation varie
   dans le cas de la Norv \& egrave;ge, un syst \& egrave;me multipartite
   avec de grandes variations dans la taille des municipalit \& eacute;s.
   Sur la base d'une enqu \& ecirc;te aupr \& egrave;s des dirigeants de
   sections municipales de partis et de listes locales, ainsi que
   d'entretiens qualitatifs avec les dirigeants de sections et de listes,
   nous analysons les causes de cette variation concernant deux variables d
   \& eacute;pendantes: le degr \& eacute; d'int \& eacute;gration entre la
   section du parti et le groupe communal et l'implication des sections du
   parti dans le travail du conseil. L'analyse montre qu'en g \& eacute;n
   \& eacute;ral le travail dans les branches et les groupes de conseils
   est fortement int \& eacute;gr \& eacute;. Cependant, les sections
   locales des partis de centre-gauche sont susceptibles d'\& ecirc;tre
   davantage impliqu \& eacute;es dans le travail du conseil et moins
   susceptibles d'\& ecirc;tre pleinement int \& eacute;gr \& eacute;es \&
   agrave; leurs groupes municipaux. La tradition du centre-gauche
   consistant \& agrave; donner plus de pouvoir aux organisations
   extraparlementaires semble pr \& eacute;valoir.
   Il rapporto tra l'organizzazione locale del partito e i consiglieri
   locali \& egrave; rimasto in gran parte inesplorato nella letteratura
   sui partiti politici. Questo articolo esplora come questo rapporto varia
   nel caso della Norvegia, un sistema multipartitico con grandi differenze
   nelle dimensioni dei comuni. Sulla base di un sondaggio condotto tra i
   leader delle sezioni comunali e delle liste locali, nonch \& eacute; di
   interviste qualitative con i leader delle sezioni e delle liste,
   analizziamo le cause di variazione rispetto a due variabili dipendenti:
   il grado di integrazione tra sezione del partito e gruppo in consiglio
   comunale e il coinvolgimento delle sezioni del partito nel lavoro dei
   consigli. Il quadro generale \& egrave; che il lavoro nelle sezioni e
   nei gruppi in consiglio comunale \& egrave; fortemente integrato.
   Tuttavia, \& egrave; probabile che le sezioni locali dei partiti di
   centro-sinistra siano maggiormente coinvolte nel lavoro dei consigli
   comunali e abbiano meno probabilit \& agrave; di essere pienamente
   integrate con i rispettivi gruppi. Sembra quindi prevalere la tradizione
   del centro-sinistra di dare pi \& ugrave; potere alle organizzazioni
   extraparlamentari.},

Abstract = {Whether a topic is seen in a moral or moral-emotional light has
   significant political implications. Yet, we lack knowledge about the
   process of moralization: Who defines the way topics are communicated
   about? Where prior research has investigated the relative power of
   different actors to place a topic on the agenda or shape opinions, we
   study who sets the moral and moral-emotional tone of debate. To do so,
   we zoom in on immigration discourse in Germany and analyze fine-grained
   social media data from politicians, political parties, newspapers, and
   members of the public over a period of more than four years. After
   employing a transformer model to identify moral and moral-emotional
   appeals, we use structural vector autoregression models to demonstrate
   the important role of radical-right challengers in shaping public
   discourse in a negative moral-emotional direction. The results inform
   theories of moralization and political entrepreneurship.},

Abstract = {Since 2022, the United States has provided more aid to Ukraine than to
   any other country, but this policy has become increasingly contentious.
   Identifying the nature of public support for this aid is critical for
   public policy, but it also raises central issues for scholars studying
   foreign policy preferences. I conducted a preregistered survey
   experiment that varies partisan cues and the content of appeals to
   support aid to Ukraine. I find that these appeals are strongly
   conditioned by partisanship and attention to the issue. Among Democrats,
   normative appeals increase support. Among Republicans, and to a lesser
   extent, independents, a partisan appeal by Donald Trump reduces support.
   However, these findings only hold among respondents not following the
   issue closely. On this high-profile issue in a polarized setting, other
   appeals largely fail to move attitudes. These results point to a
   paradox. Those respondents most likely to be moved by appeals for or
   against aid to Ukraine are also those paying the least attention to the
   issue, which suggests it will be difficult to move public attitudes on
   support for aid to Ukraine.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of procedural regularity on public
   perceptions of the U.S. Supreme Court. I argue that substantive
   legitimacy can stem from procedural regularity. Using a novel 2 x 2 x 2
   experimental design I develop and test multiple hypotheses base on a
   procedural regularity and fairness model. The study analyzes how
   decisions made via the emergency docket affect both diffuse and specific
   support for the Court, drawing on a multi-wave survey of 3793 nationally
   representative respondents. Results reveal that procedural
   irregularities significantly reduce specific support for the Court,
   while diffuse support remains largely unaffected. This pattern holds
   even when controlling for factors such as democratic values, policy
   agreement, and perceived ideological distance. These findings suggest
   that the Court's procedural choices can influence public perceptions,
   particularly specific support. This research offers important insights
   into the complex relationship between judicial procedures and public
   opinion, indicating that at least some of the Court's legitimacy is in
   its own hands. As debates intensify over the Court's use of expedited
   procedures, this study provides timely, empirical evidence of their
   potential consequences.},

   a `quantum leap' in the public perception of AI, its impact on politics
   and its sible uses in this sphere are explained. In the following

Abstract = {The quest for expanding influence in Central Asia has long been a
   pursuit for India and Iran, driven by historical, cultural, economic,
   and strategic imperatives. This article seeks to understand why these
   two countries have not been able to materialize their shared goal
   despite possessing high potential and a common desire. Drawing on the
   theoretical framework of neoclassical realism, this study highlights how
   systemic constraints, particularly those imposed by the U.S., have
   impeded India's efforts to draw closer to Iran and thwarted the
   finalization of crucial joint infrastructure projects, such as INSTC and
   the development of Iran's Chabahar port. Key to these constraints is the
   regional strategy employed by the U.S., which aims to bind India within
   the Indo-Pacific alliance-building framework while isolating Iran
   through sanctions regimes. Employing the process tracking method and
   drawing insight from national documents and statements of senior
   officials, this research sheds light on the complex interplay of
   international system dynamics impacting the pursuit of India and Iran's
   regional ambitions.},

Abstract = {Studies have found that pandemics can heighten xenophobia among host
   citizens, often explained by the behavioral immune system theory or
   elite-driven scapegoating. However, most research has overlooked the
   role of pandemic-related economic restrictions and job loss on sentiment
   toward immigrants. To isolate this economic mechanism, we examine the
   case of Venezuelan migrants in Colombia before and during COVID-19.
   Despite the Colombian government's severe economic lockdown, few
   politicians blamed Venezuelans for the pandemic. Thus, any economic
   impact on xenophobia should be evident. Using a panel experimental
   survey of 374 Colombians, supplemented with 550 new respondents at
   endline, we find no evidence that exposure to COVID-19 changed attitudes
   towards Venezuelans, even for those directly affected by the pandemic.
   Yet, those who did not lose their jobs viewed Venezuelan migration more
   positively at endline, providing support for the economic effects of
   pandemics.},

Abstract = {There is widespread agreement in social movement research that
   successful mobilization requires gathering large numbers in public
   spaces. But what happens when repressive states close public spaces off
   to protests and activists lack the capacity to win them from state
   control? This article utilizes a case study of state workers' movements
   in Jordan in the run-up to the 2011 uprisings to demonstrate how
   activists can mobilize under repressive conditions by seeking out less
   conventional spaces. Specifically, workers may be able to access state
   spaces associated with public employment (e.g., state ministries and
   public schools). I argue that these spaces can serve as sheltering
   spaces for protestors to engage in early movement-building activities
   and as performative spaces to generate political support needed to
   expand into more exposed spaces. Overall, this research contributes to
   understanding contentious politics in politically repressive settings by
   identifying a middle ground between covert resistance and mass public
   demonstrations.},

Abstract = {We argue that characteristics of unelected officials directly influence
   individuals' perceptions and evaluations of them. These evaluations then
   have indirect, downstream consequences on evaluations of the
   institution. To test this, we fielded a unique survey with an oversample
   of Black Americans after the nomination of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson
   to the Supreme Court. Using a conjoint experimental design to randomize
   nominee race, we find that increased racial descriptive representation
   elicits more favorable views of the nominee and Court among Black
   respondents. Causal mediation analysis confirms our theoretical
   expectation that descriptive representation indirectly influences views
   of the Court through its effects on views of nominees. The effects we
   uncover are not confined to co-partisan nominees, indicating that
   descriptive representation may matter for more than policy reasons
   alone. Finally, our external validity test suggests these effects
   generalize beyond our experimental setting, with Black (but not white)
   respondents equally as supportive of an anonymous profile matching
   Justice Jackson's characteristics as they are of Jackson herself.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 21},
Abstract = {According to a classic democratic ideal, citizens and politicians ought
   to define the political aims of a community, while neutral experts and
   bureaucrats ought to devise the means with which to achieve these aims.
   The present paper re-examines the ideal division of labor between
   politicians and civil servants in a democracy and discusses when
   divergence from the ideal in the form of dissent is justified. The paper
   develops an account of the roles and responsibilities of civil servants
   and elected politicians in a democracy, taking as its point of departure
   the idea that these roles should be shaped so as to realize the values
   of autonomy, equality and justice that underpin them.},

Abstract = {There is a dearth of comprehensive studies examining the compositional
   and asymmetric effects of defence spending on simultaneous economic
   growth. This study uses the Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag
   (NARDL) approach to analyse how disaggregated defence spending affects
   economic growth in Greece in the short and long term. The results hold
   significant theoretical and practical policy implications. First,
   military spending boosts economic growth in the short term but hampers
   it in the long run. Second, the long-term effects of positive and
   negative defence spending shocks are distinct, with positive shocks more
   detrimental to economic growth than the benefits of negative shocks.
   Finally, our study reveals that personnel expenditures have the most
   significant and enduring effects on economic growth compared to other
   military spending categories. Based on these results, Greece should
   adopt a new defence doctrine that relies on extensive personnel
   reserves, prioritises state intelligence and production technology, and
   promotes domestic military equipment over expensive foreign options.},

Title = {Scaring for the greater good? Discursive construction of fear appeals in
   the brexit referendum campaign},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 14},
Abstract = {This article deals with fear appeals in the Remain campaign during the
   2016 Brexit referendum, as a prime case of exploitation of anticipative
   fear in political campaigning. It explores the topic uniquely through
   the discursive lens, highlighting the need for a more nuanced reading of
   fear-based discourse in the Remain campaign beyond the broad-brush image
   often offered in the extant literature. It identifies the patterns of
   the discursive construction of fear appeals by analysing and
   interpreting both its macro-discoursal and micro-linguistic content and
   strategies. To do so, the inquiry works with a dataset of public
   addresses by nine leading Remain campaigners (Cameron, Osborne, Hammond,
   May, Truss, Corbyn, Alan Johnson, Sturgeon and Clegg) and employs a
   mixed-methods approach, combining systematic qualitative content
   analysis with the discourse-historical approach to critical discourse
   analysis. At the same time, the article has a broader relevance beyond
   the Brexit case. Fear-based discourse continues to persist (especially
   in the context of Covid-19 pandemic or climate change). Consequently,
   the study also critically discusses the practical implications of
   political elite-driven fear messaging.},

   Belgian political space of 1979},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 12},
Abstract = {There is a wide consensus that Belgian politics used to be structured
   along class, denominational and linguistic divides during organised
   modernity. The present study explores whether these political divides -
   which have primarily been corroborated by analyses on the structural
   underpinnings of voting behaviour - were also anchored in ideological
   dissensus among voters; thereby constituting a `cleavage' in the thicker
   sociological sense. Through harnessing unique post-electoral survey data
   from 1979, this contribution reconstructs a Belgian `political space'
   that operationalises the interplay of social, ideological, and political
   divides. Within this political space, clear traces of the presupposed
   tripartite cleavage structure are detected in Flanders and Wallonia,
   even though the ideological conflicts encapsulating these cleavages tend
   to differ between the two regions. Crucially, the analysis also lays
   bare the initial signs of a burgeoning cultural cleavage, which, while
   highly polarising, is not yet electorally structuring. Ultimately, these
   findings add an empirical basis to classical works on the Belgian
   cleavage structure.},

Abstract = {Recent high-profile investigations into the U.S. judiciary have
   demonstrated that judges often refuse to recuse themselves from cases
   where they hold a conflict of interest. Given women's presence in
   various political institutions has been shown to decrease perceptions of
   corruption and increase trust and legitimacy, I use a survey experiment
   to assess whether the public is more trusting of the decision-making of
   women judges who refuse to recuse themselves in cases where they hold a
   financial or interpersonal conflict of interest. I find women judges who
   refuse to recuse are trusted more to be unbiased in their
   decision-making, relative to male judges. Importantly, I find that men
   and women respondents are not equally trusting of women judges in this
   context. Specifically, men are more trusting of women judges than women.},

Abstract = {Many theorists believe ideals of deliberation realize democratic
   equality by ensuring each speaker's influence is commensurate with the
   strength of the reasons they give. This article argues that view is
   incomplete. When the frames, interpretations, and concepts speakers
   bring into debate disproportionately reflect the perspectives of
   socially advantaged groups, they contribute to hermeneutic injustices
   that impede marginalized citizens' voice even under the most favorable
   deliberative rules. In response, I describe the role institutions of
   mass communication play in shaping the epistemic resources available to
   deliberators and show how structural biases toward advantaged groups
   within those institutions generate shared understandings that undermine
   deliberation's egalitarian potential. Pursuing democratic equality,
   then, requires not only the fair exchange of reasons but also proactive
   efforts to identify and correct institutional mechanisms of hermeneutic
   injustice.},

Abstract = {This article examines the perceptions of domestic workers regarding
   domestic and caregiving work, paid and unpaid, in the Peruvian context.
   Through 19 focus groups, this paper highlights how these workers sustain
   life, facing social neglect and overcoming deeply rooted barriers of
   exclusion and discrimination in their occupational sector. Additionally,
   the article addresses the absence of political measures for social
   protection, which directly impacts their quality of life.},

Abstract = {We explore the aftermath of electoral defeats for incumbents in
   competitive authoritarian regimes, positing that they escalate
   repression in response. While prevailing research on competitive
   authoritarian regimes typically analyses incumbent repression at the
   national level, we focus on its effects on local political actors. Our
   argument centres on subnational variation in repression, influenced by
   the incumbent's strength within the local city council. Specifically,
   incumbents tend to employ legislative blockage to hinder opposition
   mayors from efficiently delivering public goods when their party holds a
   majority of seats in the city council. We present original data on
   legislative proposals in city councils and employ a mixed-method
   approach to investigate this phenomenon. The 2019 local elections in \&
   Idot;stanbul offer a unique opportunity to probe the dynamics of
   repression against the opposition at the local level. Our findings
   underscore that repression neutralizes emerging political leaders,
   thereby undermining municipal administration in the process.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 1},
Abstract = {Many international organizations (IOs) rely on voluntary contributions
   from member states and private actors to fund their operations.
   Donations from individuals are a significant and increasing income
   source for these IOs, who rely on marketing strategies such as celebrity
   endorsement, in the form of Goodwill Ambassadors, to help raise funds.
   Little is known, however, about the effectiveness of this strategy in
   the context of IOs although intuition from literatures in marketing and
   psychology suggests that celebrity endorsement should be effective. We
   conduct a survey experiment to investigate the effectiveness of Goodwill
   Ambassadors and, contrary to expectations, find no average effect of
   celebrity endorsement on donations to, and interest in, IOs and only
   limited effects among certain sub-groups. We speculate that the context
   of IOs makes it harder to generate the type of connection between
   celebrity and cause necessary to make endorsement effective and suggest
   that further investigation is needed.},

Title = {Evaluating electoral reforms and its consequences in Indonesia and
   Thailand (2000-2023)},

Abstract = {This article investigates electoral reforms in Indonesia and Thailand in
   the 21st century, highlighting important dimensions of the electoral
   changes and their consequences in disproportionality and the effective
   number of parties. In the first stage, we identify electoral changes and
   the ideal goals of electoral reform. Second, we compare each election's
   results by calculating disproportional results and the effective number
   of parties, followed by in-depth interviews with key stakeholders (N =
   8) to uncover the evaluation and recommendation for a better future of
   the electoral system in both countries. The analysis reveals the
   government's motivation behind the electoral system chosen. In
   Indonesia, the reforms addressed realising the limited pluralism party
   system raised a thorny debate among small to medium parties about
   rescuing their seats in parliament. Otherwise, the Thai government
   accommodates small parties by waiving the electoral threshold. We
   identify that different people in positions of power in each country
   cause different ideal goals. This research contributes to developing an
   understanding that elite motivation outweighs the public good in
   designing electoral reform. While in Thailand the control to determine
   which electoral system is chosen seems more centralised by the junta
   military, the shift of the electoral system in Indonesia is strongly
   motivated by political actors in order to gain their pragmatic
   interests.},

Abstract = {Political Science is a relatively new subject in the Mauritian academic
   context. As a small island developing state located in the Indian Ocean,
   it has many interesting features from which to draw to teach the
   discipline. These features include the ethnic and cultural diversity of
   its population; the island's political stability in a geographical
   region known for recurrent political violence; its curious power-sharing
   model and its strategic location in the Indian Ocean magnified by the
   vastness of its Exclusive Economic Zone and contested territories. All
   these provide a uniquely stimulating intellectual context for teaching
   and researching about politics. However, teaching Political Science in
   Mauritius involves grappling with several complexities such as
   developing students' critical thinking skills and limited academic
   exchanges with international scholars due to the remoteness of the
   island itself. Moreover, as other African universities, the question of
   decolonizing the curriculum is relevant in the Mauritian context as the
   discipline remains highly western centric.},

Title = {Understanding Voter Resistance to Political Campaigns: Evidence from
   National Elections of Pakistan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 17},
Abstract = {Political marketing literature acknowledges the pivotal role of
   marketing campaigns in building political support, yet a notable gap
   exists in understanding voters' resistance to political campaigns. This
   paper argues that voters' resistance can be managed if their attitudes
   are understood. Grounded in the Tripartite theory of attitude that
   conceptualizes attitude as a complex relationship between cognition
   (voter's apathy, skepticism and cynicism), affection (voter's
   dissatisfaction and frustration) and conation (voter's resistance to
   political campaigns), the study tests a model for understanding
   resistance to political marketing. An empirical investigation of 454
   participants from 2018 national elections in Pakistan, utilizing a
   structured questionnaire for data collection and employing structural
   equation modeling analysis techniques, reveals that skepticism and
   dissatisfaction significantly fuel voters' resistance to political
   efforts. These factors engender disbelief, erode trust, and diminish
   interest in political candidates and their parties. Based on these
   findings, we draw implications for advocating citizen engagement over a
   sole reliance on advertisements to mitigate negative voter attitudes
   toward political campaigns.},

Abstract = {The political interest of men rises faster than that of women during
   late adolescence and early adulthood in Britain (Fraile and
   Sanchez-Vitores in Polit Psychol 41(1):89-106, 2020). This paper
   analyses whether factors relating to education, the assumption of adult
   roles and family background can explain this growing disparity. We use
   panel data of the British Household Panel Study (BHPS) and Understanding
   Society (USoc) to examine these factors. Education turns out to be the
   only factor that is related to different growth trajectories of
   political interest between men and women. Women with lower levels of
   education or vocational qualifications show stable or declining levels
   of political interest while all other categories show rising levels of
   interest between ages 16 and 30. Education can, however, only partially
   account for the rising gender gap. Variables representing the attainment
   of adult roles, such as occupational status, marital status and
   household composition, and variables capturing family socialisation are
   not linked to the growing disparity of political interest between men
   and women. Most of this gap thus remains unexplained.},

Abstract = {In this essay, I consider whether there is a place for trust in the
   American constitutional order and what it means if there is. In
   particular, I argue that a constitutional way of life requires a certain
   kind of trust, what I shall call civic trust, which I describe as an
   attitudinal disposition to engagement and cooperation with others in the
   shared project of constitutional self-governance. Civic trust is a
   specific conception of trust; it has a public as well as a private
   character and it is an essential component of a healthy and successful
   constitutional regime. In short: civic trust is a constitutional good.
   Its absence in our public life is not only a marker but also a cause of
   constitutional dysfunction.},

   of craft and labor of which he has encyclopedic knowledge and a set of

Abstract = {In China, the battle to end poverty has now undergone a transformation
   from quantitative to qualitative poverty alleviation. This shift has
   been reflected mainly in the form of achievements in rural and regional
   poverty alleviation, and of poverty alleviation achievements driven by
   institutional changes. President Xi Jinping's important discussions on
   poverty alleviation have played a key role in the adapting of Marxist
   anti-poverty theory to the Chinese context, and provide scientific
   guidance for China in its momentous struggle to consign poverty to the
   past. The institutional advantages of socialism provide a strong
   guarantee of success for China's poverty alleviation, and the country's
   great achievements in this endeavor also reflect the institutional
   advantages possessed by China since the reform and opening up. After
   eliminating absolute poverty, China needs to establish a long-term
   mechanism to address relative poverty and to consolidate and expand its
   achievements in the poverty alleviation field.},

Abstract = {This essay focuses on how more democratic processes and more democratic
   participation are not in themselves good measures for a successful
   democratic order. Rather, whether more democratic participation is good
   depends on the type of knowledge the people actually bring to the
   political order. Increases in democratic participation are, thus, a
   misleading measure of democratic success. The crucial point is what sort
   of knowledge the people bring to democratic discourse. Furthermore,
   political and civic institutions play a key role in fostering and
   shaping public understandings. Here, I suggest that American
   institutions, while designed to help educate popular understandings by
   requiring the building of complex democratic majorities, have in many
   instances enabled the worst aspects of popular government, often
   empowering minority rule, rather than refining popular sentiment. Thus,
   American political institutions could engage in constitutional reform to
   recapture the balance between popular understandings and the
   constitutional institutions that help articulate, educate, and refine
   those understandings.},

Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {Xi Jinping's statements on poverty alleviation form an important
   component of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese
   Characteristics for a New Era. These statements embody a series of
   systematic concepts regarding poverty alleviation, constructed around a
   scientifically rigorous theoretical system which, while drawing
   extensively on the lessons of past Chinese practice, also possesses
   distinct 21st-century characteristics. At the same time, the statements
   condense contemporary China's extremely rich recent experience of
   fulfilling the tasks of poverty alleviation. These concepts and
   theoretical achievements, along with the basic experience they
   encapsulate, reveal the scientific laws of poverty alleviation, and have
   greatly enriched and developed Marxist anti-poverty theory. As the
   latest theoretical advances in the field of poverty alleviation, and as
   the theoretical expression and enhancement of the path to poverty
   alleviation with Chinese characteristics, their success may be
   attributed to socialism with Chinese characteristics. Consequently, Xi
   Jinping's statements on poverty alleviation, along with the practical
   achievements related to them, have momentous status and possess
   far-reaching significance for the history of the development of the
   Chinese nation, the history of the development of world socialism, and
   the history of human anti-poverty efforts.},

Abstract = {The first televised presidential campaign commercials ran in the 1952
   electoral contest between Dwight Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson,
   specifically as part of the effort to draft and then elect General
   Eisenhower. These first spot ads were developed not by political parties
   or the candidates but by an independent citizens group, Citizens for
   Eisenhower. The group developed two distinct styles of television
   advertising. The best known of these stemmed from the hard-sell Madison
   Avenue tradition of public relations and its advertising innovator,
   Rosser Reeves, who produced the ``Eisenhower Answers America{''}
   campaign. Less well known is an ad created by volunteer workers from the
   Disney Corporation, who produced an animated, musical rendition
   promising that ``We'll Take Ike to Washington.{''} Unlike Reeves's more
   substantive ads that focused on issues, the Disney ads emphasized the
   image and character of the candidate. Using archival sources, this
   article shows that the televised marketing of the presidency stemmed not
   only from the public relations experts and Madison Avenue advertisers
   like Reeves but also from those connected to the entertainment industry
   who sought to manipulate the public through character appeals.},

Title = {The blurry judicialization of politics in redemocratized Brazil: the
   judgment of Habeas Corpus 152.752/PR and Brazilian Supreme Federal
   Court's smoke cloak},

Abstract = {The increasing interference of the judiciary in moral and political
   controversies, usually known as judicialization of politics, is a
   phenomenon of global scope. In redemocratized Brazil, the
   neoconstitutionalism promoted an inflation of the role played by judges
   and tribunals, who began not only to act as protectors of and
   subordinates to the 1988 Federal Constitution - seeking to consolidate
   the idea of welfare state - but also as main solvers of nuclear
   political dilemmas, which shape the basic structures of Brazilian
   democracy. An example of this phenomenon was the judgment of Lula's
   Habeas Corpus 152.752/PR by Brazilian Supreme Federal Court, which, on
   the eve of the 2018 presidential elections, decided that the former
   president > s arrest was constitutional before his criminal sentence
   became final, confirmed only in the second jurisdictional level. Thus,
   this paper, through bibliographic research, documental analysis and case
   studies, based on an analytical, descriptive and evaluative methodology,
   seeks, primarily, to develop the idea of blurred judicialization of
   politics, as well as to demonstrate some of the main reasons why this
   phenomenon represents a relevant danger to Brazilian democracy. Finally,
   it is concluded that the Supreme Federal Court, when judging HC
   152.752/PR, decided a nuclear political issue under the false argument
   of deciding a mere conflict between fundamental rights, thus covering
   itself with a smoke cloak that makes it practically intangible to any
   type of criticism or funccional limitation.},

Abstract = {This article results from a study conducted on the process of
   militarization of Brazilian society, discussing the institutionalization
   of educational public policies based on the advancement of
   neoconservatism, whose main banner is the militarization of education in
   Brazil. By analyzing the history of the concepts of the ideal soldier
   and the social function of the Army, it was possible to observe the
   construction that allowed the military discourse of intervention to
   occupy a privileged position of power-knowledge within Brazilian
   society, making public policies, particularly educational ones
   exemplified by the PECIM, powerful tools to strengthen and legitimize
   its discursive practices and the regime of truth that have supported and
   continue to support specific political actions in the present.},

Abstract = {Starting from the argument that campaign spending impacts more
   challengers than incumbents, in elections where candidates from
   institutionalized parties run against candidates from emerging parties
   and independents, and where there are no incumbents, the effect of
   campaign spending should be weaker for the former, whose parties have
   more name recognition. With data on the 1278 constitutional conven-tion
   candidates that ran for the 138 seats in the 28 open list proportional
   representation districts in Chile in May of 2021, we test two hypotheses
   on the determinants of elec-toral success. We find a positive effect of
   campaign spending, but campaign spending has an interactive negative
   effect on the success of candidates from leftwing and right-wing
   institutionalized parties. Campaign spending had a higher return for
   candidates from emerging groups and parties than for candidates from
   institutionalized parties.},

Title = {Political anthropology of south-south migration: residence and

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The South-South migration process defines the continent's own genetics
   associated with deep systemic inequality, as well as regional and global
   policies of inclusion and exclusion typical of the neoliberal State. The
   context corresponds to a historical development scheme of concentration
   of economic and political opportunities at the national level, in which
   imbalances are accentuated that modify the relationships between groups,
   economic sectors and regions. This places migrant subjects in tense
   dynamics in the field of culture, democracy, interrelationships,
   recognition and governability, in the face of the idea of the nation and
   institutional capacities. With a structural approach and with an
   emphasis on political anthropology in which power relations are
   expressed in the sphere of everyday life, this article critically
   reflects on the difficulties of migratory projects and construction of
   citizenship in current Chile, within a transversal problematization that
   goes beyond what is strictly migratory. It is methodologically supported
   by a set of bibliographic references that go beyond what is strictly
   migratory and interviews carried out in recent years, collecting
   expressions of subjectivity that confirm the difficulties of being a
   migrant within the framework of neoliberal democracy.},

Abstract = {The rise of Euroscepticism has prompted extensive academic
   investigation, with researchers exploring a wide variety of areas and
   uncovering substantial information in recent decades. Despite these
   achievements, the overall self-knowledge of the literature-its
   overarching themes, the countries scrutinised, the methodologies
   employed, and their evolution over time-remains relatively
   underexplored. To bridge this gap, this study utilises wizdom.ai to
   delineate the borders of Euroscepticism by conducting a meta-analysis of
   over 400 journal articles between 1995 and 2020. The findings reveal two
   distinct macro-periods. The first-1995 to 2010-primarily comprises
   party-based, single-country qualitative studies. Conversely, the latter
   period-2011 to 2020-witnessed a proliferation of research, marked by an
   expansion into previously under-investigated topics, countries, and
   methodologies. This is exemplified by a notable increase in quantitative
   and comparative publications across many EU Member States. These
   findings constitute a preliminary basis for assessing the existing
   breadth and depth of the study of Euroscepticism and may stimulate
   further research on the topic.},

Abstract = {We know little about the extent to which racial minorities are
   symbolically represented by members of Congress. This stands in contrast
   to a wealth of research analyzing the extent to which minorities are
   substantively and descriptively represented. This article provides the
   most comprehensive analysis of symbolic representation to date. Using
   data on legislators' speech from 105,875 newsletters and 620,838 floor
   speeches, I find that White legislators of both parties are more likely
   to symbolically represent Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians if those groups
   are more populous in their constituency. However, these effects only
   hold cross-sectionally; using a difference-in-differences setup from
   redistricting shocks, I find that there is little within-legislator
   variation in speech patterns as their constituencies change. Lastly, I
   show that, unlike on the symbolic dimension, legislators' substantive
   representation is not influenced by group size. I conclude that White
   legislators are symbolically responsive to their constituents'
   identities in their speech patterns.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {According to the empowerment hypothesis, minority politicians encourage
   minority participation. The relationship between representation and
   participation has been extensively analyzed for several ethnic
   minorities and women, but there are no studies for indigenous
   populations in Latin America. This paper evaluates the link between
   descriptive representation and electoral registration of Mapuche, a
   deprived indigenous minority from the South of Chile that is as large as
   ten percent of the total population. We implement a panel estimation
   that controls district effects using a national dataset of more than
   three million new registrations in Chile for five municipal elections.
   We found that Mapuche mayors are significantly associated with higher
   Mapuche participation during the first year of the mayoral period. Since
   registration in Chile occurs throughout the representatives' term, and
   we use registrations long before the next election, our evidence
   suggests that officeholding affects participation by channels other than
   electoral campaigning. To shed light on the channels, we describe the
   symbolic and substantive mechanisms used by Mapuche mayors to empower
   their communities.},

Abstract = {I study the impact of party campaigns on tactical voting, focusing on
   voters with tactical incentives. Focusing on three UK Elections, I
   exploit panel data within each election to address endogeneity in party
   behavior, which would otherwise bias the estimates of campaign effects.
   My findings show that party contacts during campaigns have an influence
   in encouraging loyalty to preferred nonviable parties and defection to
   alternative viable ones. These findings are important as relatively
   little is known about what influences voters' decision to cast tactical
   votes, beyond their demographic characteristics and the electoral
   circumstances they may find themselves in.},

Abstract = {Political polarization represents one of the main worries concerning the
   health of contemporary democracy. In this article, we review the debate
   on political polarization linking its main causes to the electoral
   campaign process during the 2022 Italian general election. Specifically,
   we examine the communication strategies employed by the leaders of the
   victorious right-wing coalition on Facebook and Twitter, focusing on
   their use of partisanship, divisive issues, attacks on opponents and
   incivility, while also assessing the engagement of their followers. Our
   findings confirm the prominent role of divisive issues and partisanship,
   but reveal a notable decline in attack-related messages and incivility.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the intricate dynamics between electoral
   integrity, financial satisfaction, and democratic governance in
   Bangladesh, a nation facing challenges in democratic governance amid
   rapid economic growth. Through analysing perceptions of electoral
   integrity and household financial satisfaction, this research delves
   into their potential moderating effects on perceptions of democratic
   governance. With a focus on Bangladesh, which exemplifies paradoxical
   trends of democratic backsliding alongside significant economic
   advancements, this study contributes to the broader discourse on
   democracy and governance. It posits that financial satisfaction plays a
   crucial role in shaping individuals' perceptions of democratic
   governance, especially under the legacy of compromised electoral
   integrity. This research enriches the theoretical and empirical
   landscape, offering insights into the paradoxical nature of democratic
   backsliding and economic progress.},

Abstract = {Candidates from established political families are more likely to win
   than their non-dynastic counterparts because their political inheritance
   often includes significant advantages in resources and reputation. Yet
   dynastic candidates also bring their own set of experiences and
   qualities to the game. Is it the case that their individual
   characteristics can explain their electoral success, or is their success
   due to their family legacy? Theoretically, how and when are political
   resources transferred to the new generation? We examine these questions
   by looking at non-incumbent candidates in city and county council
   elections in Taiwan from 2009 to 2014, drawing on unique data on
   politicians' backgrounds. The profile of dynastic candidates differs
   from that of non-dynastic candidates: they are younger, have less
   electoral experience and list experience in different sorts of
   organizations and jobs. However, these differences are not what drives
   their electoral success; indeed, they tend to win despite these
   qualities rather than because of them. Even after controlling for
   candidate quality, dynastic status remains a powerful predictor,
   conveying roughly a 20 percentage point increase in the probability of
   winning. This suggests that while dynastic candidates accrue some of
   their advantage long before they run for office, a large part of the
   inheritance is transferred during the campaign.},

Abstract = {The increasingly obvious unsustainability of neoliberal capitalism
   creates an urgent need to understand how societies can meet their needs
   in a just and sustainable fashion. The new theoretical framework of the
   ``Foundational Economy{''} may provide answers, as it explores a
   holistic transformation of essential reliance systems, such as food
   provision, energy, care, and housing. However, its conceptualization of
   democratic agency needs to be strengthened. This article addresses this
   need by expanding the Foundational Economy framework with insights from
   the literature on social reproduction theory (SRT) and the solidarity
   economy (SE). SRT highlights the gendered and racialized hierarchies of
   essential reliance systems as key targets for transformation, while the
   SE encompasses participatory and non-capitalist practices that can

Abstract = {The early third millennium AD witnessed the outbreak of global crises
   and challenges that exposed the weaknesses of the possible unilateral
   order and the negative aspects of globalization. This led to a
   widespread debate among international relations thinkers about the
   transition period and the future of world order. The recent occurrence
   of two major global crises, namely, the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in
   Ukraine, has accelerated this transition period, prompting
   representatives of different schools of international relations to think
   through various scenarios for the future of world order. These scenarios
   can be classified into several categories, including the revival of the
   unipolar order with new characteristics, multipolar order, new bipolar
   order, non-polar world, and the emergence of multiple regional
   hegemonies. However, due to the differences and gaps in the
   consolidation of power centers, as well as the lack of agreement on
   international norms, it is unlikely that any of these scenarios will be
   realized in the short term. In the absence of a pervasive, tangible
   threat or a fundamental shift in political culture, the rules and
   structures of the old order will persist, albeit in a weakened state.
   This will prolong the transition period and heighten instability. Thus,
   it is crucial to manage this transition peacefully by fostering regional
   alliances, while honoring the cultural and civilizational differences of
   the key players. Ultimately, a new world order can only emerge through
   dialog among major powers and consensus on the rules that will shape the
   international system. Until that time, the global community must
   prioritize maintaining stability and navigating the transition to ensure
   a peaceful evolution toward the future order.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the constraints and capacities for Canadian
   state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to enhance economic democracy.
   Constraints include the democratic deficit produced by the
   commercialization of SOEs, which shifted away from historically
   privileging the social outcomes of public enterprise, together with the
   construction of a global governance architecture with binding and
   enforceable trade agreements that constrain democratic decision-making
   and state activity. Capacities include opportunities for SOEs to address
   deleterious economic outcomes through a rejuvenation of the socially
   oriented public enterprise tradition in areas of vexing policy concern.
   The article argues that SOEs can be an important component of enhanced
   extended state democracy through their redistributive outcomes that
   provide non-market income support for social infrastructure and
   services.},

Abstract = {I consider the role of exposure to large-scale strikes in shaping
   preferences about workplace action and labor unions, replicating and
   extending past work identifying the effect of large-scale teachers'
   strikes. I study a large 2019 grocery store strike. Using an original
   survey fielded in affected states and an instrumental variables design,
   I find strike exposure increased support for the strikes, including
   actions taken supporting the striking workers. I do not find consistent
   evidence that strikes increased interest in online actions to support
   other workers or in workers taking most forms of labor actions at their
   own jobs. Firsthand contact with strikes had no effect on individuals'
   broader perceptions of the labor movement or support for a union at
   their job. These results suggest important distinctions between strikes.
   Suggestive evidence indicates that the grocery strikes may have failed
   to inspire a greater sense of linked fate between affected members of
   the public and striking workers, as had occurred with teachers' strikes.
   I conclude by laying out a research agenda for understanding the impact
   of mass strikes.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether the relationship between the members of
   the United Nations' Treaty Bodies' (TB) home countries and the countries
   reviewed by these bodies is significant to the amount and style of
   criticism the reviewed country receives. This article explains why the
   source-target relationship is significant to shaming. It defines two
   shaming styles - Socializing shaming and Disciplining shaming and
   defines elements that enable the identification of shaming styles.
   Utilizing data on CAT shaming from 2001 to 2022 and on TB members'
   country of origin it shows through regression analysis that the
   existence of a trade partnership between TB members' home countries and
   reviewed countries results in more criticism. This article qualitatively
   identifies elements of Socializing versus Disciplining shaming in the
   communications with countries that are trade partners of the TB members'
   home countries. It finds that Socializing shaming elements are more
   prevalent. This article draws theoretical, empirical and policy
   conclusions.},

Title = {Radical right and anti-vax protests between movements and parties: a

Abstract = {Mobilisations opposed to vaccinations and other Covid-19-related
   measures have dominated the protest arena in the recent years of the
   pandemic. Radical right collective actors, whether newly emerging or
   revitalised, have successfully shaped public discourses and gained
   significant roles on the streets and in party politics. This paper
   analyses the radical right (RR) mobilisation that takes place in
   response to the pandemic, looking at the main actors, demands and
   strategies behind protest events, and paying particular attention to the
   relationship between movements and parties. The analysis focusses on
   Italy and Hungary, two European countries characterised by favourable
   political opportunities for radical right mobilisation in recent years.
   The argument is that the pandemic offered a new window of opportunities
   for the empowerment of (new and old) radical right collective actors,
   leading, however, to different outcomes in terms of `movement-parties'
   relations (or `movement-parties' formation). The article draws on a
   mixed method approach including a protest event analysis based on
   newspapers and police records (2021-2022), comprising more than 300
   events, and 30 in-depth interviews with radical right and anti-vax
   activists and leaders in both countries. The findings highlight that
   while health-related demands are the most important issues in both
   countries, the outcomes of such protests are different, both in terms of
   the intensity of radical right mobilisation (including violence) and in
   the movement-party relations. In the Italian case, the protest against
   vaccines gives birth to a strict division of labour or `conflict'
   between RR movements (which remained the main actors of the street
   protest) and political parties (in institutions), while in Hungary the
   two sides are characterised by `cooperation'. These results demonstrate
   that in the two analysed countries, anti-vax and Covid-19-related
   protests have different impacts on national politics and the conflict
   arena, which require investigation of movement-party relations to be
   fully grasped.},

Abstract = {We introduce a global dataset on education policies and systems across
   modern history (EPSM), which includes measures on compulsory education,
   ideological guidance and content of education, governmental intervention
   and level of education centralization, and teacher training. EPSM covers
   157 countries with populations exceeding 1 million people, and time
   series extend from 1789 to the present. The new dataset opens up for
   studying several questions concerning political control and the
   politicized nature of education systems. In addition to describing the
   measures, we detail how the data were collected and discuss validity and
   reliability issues. Thereafter, we describe historical trends in various
   education system characteristics. Finally, we illustrate how our data
   can be used to address key questions about education and politics,
   replicating and extending recent analyses on the (reciprocal)
   relationship between education and democratization, the impact of
   education on political attitudes, and how rural inequality interacts
   with regime type in influencing education systems.},

Abstract = {Political scientists heavily rely on standard survey questions referring
   to ``democracy{''} when they study citizens' attitudes toward (liberal)
   democracy. However, we only know little about the way in which citizens
   respond to these questions. This article focuses on two frequently
   highlighted issues: social desirability and the consistency between
   citizens' understanding and researchers' understanding of the term
   ``democracy.{''} To address these issues, I collected novel survey data
   via YouGov from 14,000 British, French, German, and Italian respondents.
   I use a list experiment to show that respondents do not feel socially
   pressured to misreport their support for democracy. However, what
   citizens have in mind when they claim to support democracy only reflects
   norms and institutions of minimal conceptions of democracy. Overall,
   this encourages the usage of questions regarding citizens' support for
   democracy widely, although this should not be interpreted as the support
   for anything going beyond minimal conceptions of democracy (providing
   freedom and allowing for citizens' influence on political decisions).},

Abstract = {Electoral competition is determined by the issues that parties choose to
   compete on and the stances they adopt on these issues. However, little
   research has examined the trade-off between expanding a party's
   programmatic stances to secondary issues while maintaining ideological
   continuity on primary issues. This article seeks to address this gap by
   examining programmatic transitions among mainstream and niche parties
   and in which contexts these transitions are more frequent. The study
   analyses 47 parties in 10 established democracies between 1986 and 2020
   using multiple regression techniques. The results show that niche
   parties are more likely to focus on secondary issues, and when they make
   such transitions, they tend to be larger. The analysis also reveals that
   the length of niche competition influences mainstream parties'
   programmatic transitions, while niche parties' transitions are driven by
   their continuity in programmatic transitions and governmental
   experience.},

Abstract = {Do targeted strikes against militant groups affect insurgent operations
   differently from terrorist operations? One of the reasons it is
   challenging for states to counter militant groups who simultaneously
   wage an insurgency and a terrorist campaign is that there are offsetting
   effects between counterinsurgency and counterterrorism. As both an
   insurgent group and a terrorist group, the Islamic State of Iraq and the
   Levant (ISIL) poses particular challenges to states. Since 2014, the
   United States and coalition allies have conducted thousands of targeted
   strikes against ISIL in Iraq and Syria as part of Operation Inherent
   Resolve (OIR). In this article, we examine the effects of targeted
   strikes against ISIL. Using a novel dataset of time-series observations
   from Iraq and Syria between 2015 and 2018, we examine the relationship
   between targeted strikes conducted under OIR and the number of insurgent
   and terrorist attacks conducted by ISIL. Our findings give empirical
   support to the theoretical argument that the same military strategy can
   have different effects on insurgency and terrorism.},

   coverage of a local issue, we focus on the case of preventive spending
   on infrastructure maintenance and repair. Inefficiently low levels of
   infrastructure investment are often attributed to low public knowledge
   about the risk of failure events. In a preregistered survey experiment,
   we test how the level and type of information in a news article affect
   support for infrastructure investment across two different types of
   infrastructure risk (repeated nuisance versus catastrophic failure). For
   both types of risk, we find that more information-rich reporting,
   whether investigative or event-driven, increases public support for
   preventive spending and imposes accountability penalties on local
   leaders who fail to invest in prevention.},

Abstract = {Education in Hobbes's civil philosophy depends on a broad-spectrum tool
   offered by the philosopher that carries a fundamental persuasive
   ingredient: fear of the State of Nature. However, decoding the weight of
   the State of Nature is not a simple task. The strong rhetorical
   character of the images constructed by the State of Nature, as suggested
   by Evrigenis in Images of Anarchy, and the demonstrative power of a
   scientific model, as we see Johnston present in The Rhetoric of
   Leviathan, create the opposition that will establish the poles that will
   anchor our analysis. In both cases, the future of a contractless society
   seems inevitable and war of all against all seems probable. We argue in
   this work that there exists a middle ground that offers a possible and
   not probable state of affairs that is sufficient to leave the necessary
   elements to allow scientific persuasion already in the Elements Law
   Natural and Politic of Hobbes.},

Abstract = {This paper estimates levels of prejudice in Scotland with data from the
   2021 Scottish Election Survey. It examines both direct and indirect
   indicators of prejudice to discover that somewhere between 15 and 20
   percent of respondents indicate prejudicial feelings towards immigrants.
   Comparisons with results from other surveys in the UK and abroad suggest
   lower rates of prejudice in Scotland, and declining rates of prejudice
   over time. Empirical comparisons reveal direct and indirect prejudice to
   be closely related in Scotland, and regression analysis discovers common
   determinants of directly and indirectly prejudicial feelings. Political
   positions, such as ideological conservativism, identifying as a Remainer
   in the Brexit debate, and support for Scottish independence are
   important determinants across indicators of prejudice, and the strength
   of these political indicators demonstrates how Scottish political
   culture has been linked to minority politics in such a way as to re-draw
   social boundaries around expressions of prejudice.},

Title = {Careerism and working-class decline: The role of party selectorates in
   explaining trends in descriptive (mis-)representation},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recent decades have seen a growing underrepresentation of working-class
   legislators and the parallel rise of professionalized ``career
   politicians{''}, especially in centre-left parties. While this changing
   class composition of parliaments has implications for representational
   inequality, we know little about its reasons. I focus on the candidate
   nomination processes in the German Social Democratic Party to understand
   the priorities and practices of party selectors. Drawing on interview
   data with key actors in the nomination processes for the 2021 federal
   election, I show that the representation of marginalized groups becomes
   more important, but class representation is excluded from party debates.
   Although many selectors share the view that the candidates' narrowing
   class backgrounds impede the representation of lower-class constituents,
   they see the reasons for this development mainly in individual obstacles
   beyond their control. Thus, while the nomination procedures disadvantage
   working-class people, they do so in a more complex way than previous
   studies suggest.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the suitability of student-driven
   internationalisation of the curriculum in a diverse educational setting.
   Despite its vast educational potential, internationalisation of the
   curriculum is an often-missing component of general internationalisation
   even in programmes and courses with a diverse student body. To remedy
   this shortcoming in a course of international politics, I introduced a
   teaching and learning innovation, which encouraged students to use
   examples based on personal experiences and regional background-rather
   than merely from the assigned literature-during their arguments in
   preparation for and during biweekly seminars. In addition, the
   assessment criteria were shifted to support the sharing of information
   and knowledge among peers in this course, called ``Theories of
   Cooperation and Conflict in International Relations{''}. The study uses
   a quasi-experimental setup and offers a comprehensive mixed-methods
   analysis of the innovation and finds that student learning and their
   classroom experience was positively impacted. While students did use
   notably more ``own experience{''} examples and improved in their written
   preparatory work for the seminars, they turned to these very cautiously
   in the actual classroom debates. The findings are explained by the
   interplay between internationalisation and decolonisation of the
   classroom and the increased stakes in assessment criteria.},

Abstract = {While the origins and consequences of populist attitudes in adults are
   being studied extensively, it is still unknown when populist attitudes
   might emerge in a person's life. Drawing on the existing literature on
   political socialization, we focus on populist attitudes during
   adolescence and explore the contributing role of negative relationships
   with parents, peers, and teachers. We provide the first comprehensive
   analysis of populist attitudes among a representative sample of children
   aged 12 to 18 (mean: 14.66 years) using a unique dataset gathered
   through interviews conducted in schools in Austria, Germany, and
   Switzerland (n=3,123). Our findings reveal a strong association between
   perceived unjust teacher behavior and the level of populist attitudes in
   adolescents, while the connection of peers and parents with populist
   attitudes appears to be limited. Further analyses using panel data from
   the UK support these findings.},

Abstract = {Party competition sometimes resembles an auction, where parties seek to
   `buy' elections through promises of economic largesse. In this article,
   I argue that whether parties engage in this practice will depend on
   political circumstances, such as the level of ideological competition.
   Incentives to promise more to voters will also vary depending on a
   party's electoral prospects: for parties that expect a significant level
   of government responsibility, promising too much is a risky strategy. I
   test these arguments by focusing on the spending commitments in party
   manifestos from 20 countries over the period 1945-2017. In line with
   expectations, parties tend to make more expansionary election pledges
   when ideological competition is more muted. In addition, left-wing
   parties' spending commitments are found to be influenced by their
   projected seat shares (based on opinion polls from before the start of
   the election campaign) relative to their competitors. Specifically, the
   stronger a left-wing party's electoral prospects, the more fiscally
   conservative it tends to be, and vice versa.},

Abstract = {Through a systematic analysis, this study explores the feasibility of
   turning the Pan-Arabism ideology into a reality. We trace five
   challenges to the ideology, dividing them into inherent and secondary
   difficulties. Two inherent challenges made pan-Arabism almost an
   impossible idea from its outset. The first is religion and sectarianism,
   and the second is tribalism. The secondary challenges, which include the
   struggle over leadership, contesting Arab and non-Arab ideologies, and
   the attitude toward Israel, hampered the realization of the idea.
   Reviewing the causes of the collapse of the pan-Arabism ideology leads
   us to conclude that this notion was a mere unachievable dream. Moreover,
   even as a propaganda tool, pan-Arabism is veiling the aspirations and
   ambitions of different Arab politicians.},

Title = {Institutional overlap and the survival of intergovernmental
   organisations},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 10},
Abstract = {A burgeoning literature emphasises the role of favourable external
   conditions and institutional design as key drivers of the survival of
   intergovernmental organisations. This article focuses on institutional
   overlap as a hitherto overlooked determinant of IGO survival. Studies on
   institutional complexity posit that overlap - the extent to which
   organisations perform similar tasks to address similar problems for some
   common members - may decrease the survivability of IGOs due to rule
   conflicts, institutional paralysis, and competitive pressures for
   limited resources. Contrary to this perspective, this article argues
   that greater overlap increases the likelihood of IGO survival for two
   reasons. First, similar IGOs will survive as member states use them to
   pursue forum-shopping strategies. Second, overlap enables IGO
   secretariats to draw on networks of support from other IGOs, rendering
   organisations that densely overlap with others more resilient. To test
   these propositions, the article combines data on institutional overlap
   in global governance and the survival of the 534 IGOs contained in the
   Correlates of War IGO dataset. Non-linear regression analysis finds that
   where organisations overlap more with existing organisations in terms of
   governance tasks and issue areas, the likelihood of IGO survival
   increases. Further analysis suggests that this result is driven by the
   forum-shopping strategies of powerful member states. Given that
   contemporary world politics is governed by an increasingly dense network
   of IGOs, these results hold important implications for the study of IGO
   survivability and the evolution of global governance more broadly.},

Abstract = {Racial violence is central to the American polity. We argue that support
   for violence, specifically anti-Black violence, has a long historical
   arc in American politics dating back to chattel slavery. In this paper,
   we argue that the racial violence associated with the ``great
   replacement{''} conspiracy is much more pervasive among the white
   American public because of the historical legacy of anti-Black violent
   sentiment. To investigate the prevalence of this idea, we conducted a
   preregistered simple priming experiment aimed to tap into top-of-mind
   ideas about racial demographic change. Our experimental design spans
   multiple data sources, including two probability samples, over the
   course of a year. We ultimately find that simply priming attitudes about
   racial demographic change through a single open-ended question
   consistently leads to increased support for political violence,
   increasing racial resentment, and expressed anti-Black views. Our
   approach allows us to test this question through variant methodological
   means, all of which confirm strong associations Americans have between
   racial demographic change, anti-Blackness, and violence. Our findings
   demonstrate that Black threat is an important driver of democratic
   backsliding in the realm of political violence that requires further
   attention.},

Abstract = {We identify the effects of employment on political participation by
   collaborating with 27 large companies in Ethiopia to randomly assign
   jobs to equally qualified female applicants. The job offers increase
   formal employment and earnings, but we can clearly reject any positive
   effects on political participation. We find no effects on political
   interest, raising issues, or protest activity, and we find negative
   effects on participation in community meetings. We further find that job
   offers reduce internal and external political efficacy, suggesting that
   employment may actually be politically disempowering. Our qualitative
   data suggest that several features of the jobs may contribute to lower
   political efficacy directly.},

Abstract = {This article examines the determining factors inducing the decreasing
   votes of two renowned political parties in Indonesia: The Democrat Party
   (PD) and the People Conscience Party (Hanura). As the ruling party in
   the 2009 election, the PD's votes declined dramatically in the two
   following elections. Meanwhile, Hanura failed to exceed the
   parliamentary threshold in 2019. Methodologically, it is qualitative
   research by utilizing a comparative case approach. To gather data, this
   study employed in-depth interviews and documentary analysis and
   strengthened by NVivo 12plus platform by using Crosstab Query and
   Wordcloud Analysis to visualize data. By applying the party change
   indicators developed by Harmel and Janda, the findings revealed that
   leadership change was the most influential factor toward the poor
   performance of both parties in the electoral competition. Such
   leadership change caused a detrimental conflict and changed a dominant
   faction inside the party. More specifically, the corruption case behaved
   by the PD's politicians aggravated the party charm, and the
   parliamentary threshold was a supporting aspect of the thrown out of
   Hanura from the parliament.},

Abstract = {In recent years, leaders in a number of nations have undermined their
   public sector's capacity to deliver on its core goals. To understand
   this interference, it is necessary to examine the formal and informal
   organizational dynamics at play within bureaucracies. Considering a
   widely applicable generalized organization, a formal model outlines how
   a leader may augment the career incentives of supervisors and
   lower-level workers, which shifts the alignment of policy with an
   organization's central mission. While hierarchy may amplify disruption,
   organizational culture can coalesce as a norm facilitating resistance to
   extreme shifts, thereby stabilizing long-term mission compliance. Yet,
   should disruption lead to an exodus of mission-driven employees, durable
   reversals of an organization's capacity to fulfill its aims may ensue.
   The model highlights three trajectories disrupted organizations follow:
   temporary reversal, erosion, and resistance. Implications are considered
   for public sector institutions and international organizations as well
   as for the study of bureaucratic and state capacities.},

Abstract = {Concerned about reassuring its European and transatlantic allies, during
   2023 the Meloni government pursued a foreign policy aimed at showing
   consistency of intent and reaffirming Italy's international role. In
   particular, the government has focused its efforts on redefining
   relations with the European Union, the United States, the wider
   Mediterranean and the Indo-Pacific - while interfacing with the
   Russian-Ukrainian and Israeli-Palestinian conflicts. Migration and
   energy have been guiding themes for the executive's conduct on the
   international scene, particularly in the Mediterranean region. Overall,
   the foreign policy of the Meloni government has developed in substantial
   continuity with that of Mario Draghi; what characterises it, however, is
   a marked pragmatism, an emphasis on a rediscovered national pride, as
   well as the risks of overstretch and personalisation of political
   conduct around the role of the Prime Minister.},

Abstract = {Are banks sensitive to risk and reward in following global corporate
   transparency rules? Using a worldwide field experiment, this study
   evaluates competing predictions from expected utility, behavioralist,
   and institutionalist accounts. We incorporated a dozen companies around
   the world to make over 15,000 email solicitations asking for corporate
   accounts from 5000 of the world's internationally connected banks.
   Treatments randomize the risk profiles of different companies-by their
   countries' association with corruption, terrorism, and tax evasion-and
   vary rewards by stating differing amounts of business revenues. The
   outcomes are the rates at which banks offer accounts and comply with
   rules on customer identification. The results suggest that banks are
   moderately responsive to risk-though not reward-but the magnitude of the
   effects is small, providing mixed evidence for conventional models and
   suggestive support for institutionalist accounts.},

Abstract = {Good quality information is a public utility: the rich and powerful will
   always have access to what they need to know, but poor people do not.
   Indeed, increasing inequalities in access to decent information underlie
   other more obvious inequalities. Bad information does not respect
   borders and yet democracy depends on informed citizens. The case for
   public intervention in what used to be called broadcasting, now
   including digital media-but which needs to be thought of as a public
   information space-is at a tipping point. This collection of essays sets
   out these vital challenges and offers some innovative solutions.},

Abstract = {South Asia witnessed a number of transnational solidarities, some of
   which it was home to, others that drew the region into their ambit.
   Articulations of national identity, evident in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka,
   marked shifting definitions of the politico-cultural community in South
   Asia. Concurrently, there was a congealing of ideological connections
   that straddled continents such as the leftist solidarity Afro-Asianism
   epitomized. How did social imaginaries such as these, variously imbued
   with nationalist and internationalist ethos, influence India's
   self-image? What role did sub-diplomatic solidarities forged by
   non-state actors such as activists and intellectuals play? In what ways
   had subnational activism contributed to some of these contested
   fraternities? Such questions were moot to India's assessment of its own
   state capacity in the 1980s and beyond. The article takes as its focus
   two critical sites of postcolonial India's international relations:
   transnational solidarity networks and domestic politics. In doing so, it
   attempts to offer a granular analysis of the `imagined collectivities'
   India espoused and the multiplicity of agendas these stood for and which
   it helped shape.},

Abstract = {Insurgents who achieve state control through military victory or
   elections after peace settlements can introduce ideas and structures of
   civilian governance they developed during their rebellions. Some come
   close to fulfilling their prospective legacies while others abandon them
   despite commitment to them during civil war. Characteristics of rebel
   governance and habits of military command enhance or constrain the
   creation of legacy. Significant factors can be classified in three
   categories: dimensions of rebel governance, contextual features of civil
   war and responses after taking state control. The National Resistance
   Movement's limited realisation of its wartime rebel governance in Uganda
   illustrates many of them.},

Abstract = {Although legislative brawling is a common occurrence-with 365 cases
   reported across the world between 1990 and 2018-we have a limited
   understanding of why members of representative bodies engage in
   violence. Does the lack of institutionalization or the violent nature of
   some legislators cause such behavior? This article argues that
   legislators with intense policy preferences engage in costly actions,
   such as brawling, as a means of signaling their policy commitment. To
   validate this claim, this article examines legislators' participation in
   legislative brawling and filibusters in Korea before and after the
   adoption of a filibuster procedure. I find that extreme members engaged
   in brawling before the adoption of procedural reform, while they engaged
   in filibusters after the adoption. This transformation of brawlers into
   filibusterers suggests that legislative brawling does not necessarily
   indicate a violent nature of some legislators but rather a desire by
   legislators to signal their policy commitments.},

Abstract = {The publication of Uncivil War, Huw Bennett's history of the early years
   of the Northern Ireland conflict, has highlighted an increasingly
   obstructive and uncooperative approach by the UK Ministry of Defence
   (MoD) towards academic researchers. Geraint Hughes argues that the
   impediments the MoD is placing by restricting access to archival
   evidence on recent military conflicts is not only undemocratic, but also
   distorts public awareness of the complexities of these wars, and hampers
   the British armed forces' own efforts to develop as `learning
   institutions' that can use military history to support their own
   professional understanding of the challenges posed by contemporary
   warfare. He calls for a dialogue between the MoD and the academic
   community that addresses the balance between operational security and
   accountability, and contributes to a mutually beneficial relationship
   where scholarship can contribute to the armed forces' own process of
   self and institutional education.},

Abstract = {What are the drivers of citizens' support for electoral gender quotas in
   transitioning and authoritarian states? Despite extensive research
   examining public support for women in politics in democracies, we know
   little about how the public perceives them in less democratic settings.
   To address this shortcoming, we use original survey data from
   authoritarian Morocco and transitioning Tunisia - two Arab countries
   hailed for their progressive gender policies. We argue that in these
   countries where citizens lack political information, they instead rely
   on their assessment of the government's performance to form attitudes
   toward gender quotas. Furthermore, electoral legitimacy plays an
   important role in shaping citizens' support for quotas, which are
   closely linked to how elections and legislatures operate. The findings
   offer strong support for our theoretical expectations and uncover
   important gender differences.},

Abstract = {This article considers the relationship between views of social mobility
   in British politics, identifying four competing views in government
   statements, political news stories and opinion pieces. The two
   established views are the Blairite liberal view, which seeks to widen
   entry into the `playing field' of educational `opportunity', and its
   companion bourgeois view, protecting the acclaim given to elite
   educational experiences. Against these established views are two
   insurgent views: a (politically ignored) socialist view and a
   `postliberal' view introduced into the Social Mobility Commission under
   the chairship of the loosely Conservative-aligned Katharine Birbalsingh.
   On the right, the postliberal and bourgeois views explicitly clash. On
   the left, with the socialist view dormant, the postliberal view is
   assimilated by Labour almost as a socialism substitute, appearing in
   turn with the Blairite liberal view in Labour rhetoric. The result is,
   respectively on right and left, disharmony and incoherence in the
   meaning of social mobility.},

Abstract = {The academy has undergone substantial change in the last decade with
   many new internal and external pressures. Relatively fewer full-time
   faculty are asked to do much more. Advisers are taking on more roles
   than previously expected, with little to no training. Graduate student
   enrollment has increased while the job market has tightened. Graduate
   students are experiencing worse mental health than any past cohort. The
   challenges associated with mentoring the Ph.D. students of today require
   renewed evaluation of what works and what doesn't. Here we solicited
   advice from political scientists with a history of outstanding
   mentorship to share their collective wisdom and experience about how
   they advise and provide effective mentoring for today's Ph.D. students.},

Abstract = {Putting insights from feminist political economy into conversation with
   the scholarship on legal identity, this article explores the use and
   effects of military marriages in reproducing the Kachin revolution. I
   argue that the organisation of weddings reproduces the revolution in
   both material and legal ways by creating new legal and political
   subjects with loyalties and responsibilities towards Kachin authorities.
   I suggest that the public nature of the weddings creates bonds of
   allegiance, expectations regarding the performance of particular
   gendered roles for men and women, and feelings of obligation towards
   Kachin authorities. These practices also stem from efforts by the KIO to
   encourage childbirth; although marriages across clan-lines are
   sanctioned, weddings outside the Kachin community as less acceptable to
   a leadership invested in reproducing a particular kind of Kachin
   citizen. This allows me to illustrate how the conferring of legal
   identity does not rely on documents alone, and turns our attention to
   how the practice of marriage ceremonies and their effects on everyday
   married life is generative of legal identity. This in turn shapes the
   organisation of daily lives in ways that both promote the continuance of
   the armed revolution and bind people to the nation-in-making.},

Abstract = {This research examines social media discourses to unravel how moral
   evaluation can be used to legitimize and delegitimize state violence.
   Based on a Colombian case of police violence targeting protesting
   students at the University of Cauca, this study unravels the role of
   moral evaluation of social actors and their actions in affirming or
   contesting state violence. It underlines the use of dichotomies (i.e.,
   ``bravery-cowardice,{''} ``honesty-dishonesty,{''} and
   ``evilness-goodness{''}), the attribution of immoral character traits,
   and inciting negative emotions as ways of attributing morality or
   immorality to victims and perpetrators to legitimize or delegitimize
   political violence. It especially underlines the use of religious
   references in moral evaluations. By examining social media discourses
   about state violence, this article aims to contribute to a greater
   understanding of how political violence can be legitimized and
   delegitimized based on morality and emotions, which can help in
   developing ways to promote a culture of nonviolence.},

Abstract = {Previous literature argues that macroeconomic conditions and economic
   news impact socio-tropic assessments. Others find that ideological
   identification or ideological affinity with the government impact
   socio-tropic economic views. Here, we test the moderating effect of
   ideological identification on how economic growth and economic news
   shape economic perceptions. We test this hypothesis using a dataset that
   combines monthly polls in Chile (2014-2018), economic news, and economic
   growth indicators. We find that ideological affinity with the government
   intensifies the positive impact of good macroeconomic indicators on
   current and prospective perceptions and, surprisingly, induces more
   positive current perceptions when negative economic news increases. In
   turn, ideological affinity with the government is associated with a
   slightly negative impact of good macroeconomic indicators on current
   (but not prospective) economic perceptions and a negative impact of
   negative economic news on current and prospective perceptions. Ideology
   moderates the effect of macroeconomic indicators and economic news on
   economic perceptions.},

Abstract = {This article examines the dynamics and consequences of China's Belt and
   Road Initiative (BRI) in relation to Thailand's development plan,
   focusing on cross-border trade from Thailand to China via the Laos-China
   Railway. Transboundary regulations and constraints in infrastructure are
   obstacles impeding economic integration and regional connectivity.
   Evidently, initiatives such as setting up stations for agricultural
   inspection and quarantine have not led to increased trade volume via the
   rail network. Continual efforts to fix infrastructural gaps and promote
   discourse on regulatory and procedural issues are imperative to fully
   realise the potential of Thailand-China cross-border trade via railway
   networks under the BRI framework.},

Abstract = {I explore the potential impact of rulemakers' professional experience on
   the efficiency of rulemaking by U.S. federal agencies. I highlight two
   types of professional experience rulemakers may have-inside experience
   gathered by working in the federal government, if not the same agency,
   and outside experience gained before entering the civil service or
   between stints in government. I discuss several plausible mechanisms
   through which inside and outside experience may affect rulemaking
   efficiency. Using data combining rulemakers' career backgrounds with
   rulemaking life-cycles from 1999 to 2023, I show that outside
   experience, and not inside experience, is associated with two measures
   of rulemaking efficiency: a higher likelihood for proposed rules to be
   promulgated as final and a lower likelihood of unanticipated
   events-extensions of public comment periods, other delays to the
   rulemaking timetable, and the withdrawal of rules already issued.},

Abstract = {Leading theorists of major schools of thought in international relations
   disagree over the root causes of the ongoing war in Ukraine. This paper
   examines the merits and bases of the theories or explanations provided
   by each major IR school. It explores the dominant arguments concerning
   the nature and trajectory of the ongoing war, the prospects for its
   resolution, and its strategic effects on the international system with a
   particular emphasis on China. We argue that scholars' views on these
   topics are significantly influenced by their theoretical orientations
   within international relations. Furthermore, strategic thinkers and
   policymakers, identified as homines theoretici or feminae theoreticae,
   are themselves deeply influenced by their theoretical understandings of
   the world, which in turn shape their normative engagement with world
   affairs. However, the interplay between theoretical perspectives and
   practical realities hinges on the dynamics of power and objective
   material conditions on the ground.},

   a dynamic, emerging bloc of states, which in spite of not having yet the
   coherency of the ``West{''} constitutes more than the rest. On the basis
   of this global transformation, the manipulation of the issue of Kosovo

Abstract = {This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the intricate dynamics
   surrounding female involvement in jihadism in Bangladesh. Drawing on
   expert interviews and surveys, the study uncovers a multifaceted picture
   of this phenomenon. Three distinct categories of factors - push, pull,
   and facilitating - emerge as central in explaining the surge in female
   participation within militant groups in the region. Push factors, which
   encompass grievances and vulnerabilities arising from personal crises,
   poverty and family breakdown, create an environment ripe for
   radicalisation. The concept of ``humiliation by proxy,{''} where global
   Muslim victimisation serves as a motivating force, further deepens our
   understanding of this process. Pull factors reveal that ideological
   allure, the pursuit of glory, adventure, and the evolving gender roles
   offered by groups like the Islamic State play a significant role in
   attracting women to extremist ideologies. The article underscores that
   the desire for paradise is not confined to men alone but extends to
   women. Facilitating factors, such as influential family members and
   online platforms, are pivotal in shaping female radicalisation. Cultural
   loyalty, particularly from husbands and fathers, empowers them to
   influence women towards extremism. The internet acts as a powerful tool,
   facilitating exposure to radical ideologies and virtual group bonding,
   creating echo chambers that reinforce extremist beliefs.},

Volume = {15},

Pages = {9-25},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The article provides a backdrop to citizen security in Mexico,
   presenting a critique that challenges the democratic bases of citizen
   security and offering an alternate genealogy of its analytical and
   practical implementations. On the one hand, citizen security emerges not
   only from a violent legacy of national security but also amid larger
   international and domestic trends. Internationally, citizen security is
   consistent with shifts toward human security that prioritize individual
   existence over territorial integrity. Locating the citizen as its
   referent object, citizen security forwards a universal citizen situated
   against an ever-expanding list of threats. Domestically, citizen
   security coincides with wider neoliberal reforms premised on
   public-private partnerships and a reliance on individual responsibility.
   On the other hand, a separate genealogy of citizen security in
   present-day Mexico is offered, wherein its application is drawn from
   three interconnected themes-how citizen security emerges amid a
   political legacy of national security, how it develops from analytical
   limitations in human security, and how it operates in a context of
   neoliberal governance.},

Abstract = {Foregrounding Anubhav Sinha's Hindi mainstream film Anek (released on 27
   May 2022), I will draw upon the discourses of nationalism and nation to
   examine the issues of separatist insurgency, violence, and
   militarization in the Northeast from the affective and performative lens
   in order to unsettle the reified categories of identity politics. As
   `nation-building' has important implications for nationalism and the
   nation-state, an attempt is made to map out the contours of the
   historical legacy of state formation in the Northeast India, which is
   characterized by `ethnic polities' of Northeast groups with a connection
   to a real or imagined homeland, and the recurrent politics of
   subnationalism. Delineating the current scholarship on the relationship
   between hot and banal nationalism, an endeavour is made to offer new
   ways to understand insurgency and counter insurgency in the Northeast.
   Lastly, the paper explores how sports serve as a galvanizing force for
   mobilizing national identity and unity.},

Title = {Does public justification face an `expert problem'? Some thoughts in
   light of the COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 14},
Abstract = {Policies are often justified to the public with reference to factual
   claims that most people cannot easily verify or scrutinise because they
   lack relevant knowledge or expertise. This poses a challenge for
   theories of public justification which require that laws are justified
   using reasons that all can accept. Further difficulties arise in cases
   such as the response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic where the factual
   base of knowledge used to justify policies is limited, subject to a high
   degree of disagreement amongst experts, and marked by rapid changes.
   This paper reviews some strategies that public justification theorists
   might draw on to address the question of how to justify policies that
   depend on this kind of expert knowledge. Whilst such strategies cohere
   with existing theories of public justification, they do not yield
   intuitively attractive recommendations. Ideally, theories of public
   justification would provide criteria by which to evaluate expert
   testimony such that it guides and informs, but does not lead, policy
   making. However, in cases like the pandemic response, theories of public
   reason currently tend towards recommendations that are intuitively
   unattractive: either requiring citizens to defer to `experts' in a
   fairly uncritical way or being overly permissive of most factual claims.},

Abstract = {This study introduces and elaborates on the decoupling practice of
   ``democraticwashing{''} within contemporary political discourse, where
   anti-democratic actions are concealed behind democratic rhetoric. The
   primary aim is to unravel the multifaceted nature of democraticwashing,
   which extends beyond mere language manipulation for legitimization. It
   explores instances where democratic values and the legitimation attached
   to them in the present day are internalized to the extent that
   contradictions between rhetoric and reality are adamantly denied. By
   analysing the relation between democratic discourse and anti-democratic
   actions in the Israeli case since 2009, this study provides a
   comprehensive understanding of how democraticwashing contributes to the
   erosion of democratic elements in states usually considered as
   democracies in the global arena. This research advances our
   comprehension of the contemporary challenges facing democratic
   governance worldwide while proposing a new analysis tool for the erosion
   of democracy in the contemporary era.},

Abstract = {The passage of marriage equality via the Marriage Amendment (Definition
   and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017 ushered in a new era for religion and
   politics in Australia. The polarised public debate that was provoked in
   the lead-up to the legislation continued and only served to entrench the
   perceived incompatibility of religious freedom and LGBTIQ+ rights. The
   articles in this Symposium responding to these developments were first
   presented as works-in-progress at a Macquarie University workshop on
   `Religion and Politics after Marriage Equality'. In the Introduction to
   this Symposium, we briefly outline the history and context of the
   religious freedom debate that crystalised after 2017 to introduce the
   three interdisciplinary articles that follow, each offering a unique
   perspective on the public, political, and highly personal controversies
   that accompanied this momentous change. Together these articles seek to
   enhance our understanding of how the discourse of religious freedom is
   being wielded for political gain.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},

Volume = {17},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This paper critically discusses the recent concept, stochastic terrorism
   - broadly, the idea that influential individuals may demonise target
   groups or individuals, inspiring unknown actors to take up terroristic
   violence against them. I collect together different strains of thought
   on the emerging concept, reflecting critically on what a suitable
   definition of the phenomenon would look like (or whether it would be
   needed), what the social urge to coin the concept may reveal about
   authoritarian power and violence, and what makes this form of political
   violence possible. I argue that present commentary fails to emphasise
   sufficiently the role of mistruth and deceit in such rhetoric, as well
   as its historical and mainstream precedents. Moreover, I understand the
   phenomenon to be specifically authoritarian in nature, which not only
   demonises but dehumanises its targets. In light of this, I suggest that
   given both the mainstreaming of racist conspiracy theory and the
   historical and continuing presence of centrally constructed ``folk
   devils{''}, the authoritarian problem which can manifest into stochastic
   violence is very much endemic to modern liberal democracies. With this
   framing of stochastic violence in mind, we ignore it simply as a
   buzzword at our peril: even if the theoretical issues I have highlighted
   continue to persist, even if we struggle to pin down the concept with
   desired clarity - it bears a phenomenological significance and reflects
   an ongoing political structure of violence.},

Abstract = {Candidate selection within parties is a key stage in the political
   process and provides an important frame for the degree of representation
   of social groups in parliaments. We seek to develop a better
   understanding of the effect of intersectionality on candidate selection
   processes. We do so by examining the effect of candidates' key
   socio-demographic characteristics, like their gender and ethnic
   background, on their chances of getting nominated by their party. We
   argue that features of the ideological background of the respective
   nominating party matter for the chances that women and aspirants with an
   ethnic background win the nomination as their party's district
   candidate. We make use of novel data from the 2021 German federal
   election that provides detailed information on the candidate selection
   processes of all major parties in the 299 election districts. By doing
   so, we apply existing theoretical expectations to an untested case and
   find that female competitors and aspirants with an ethnic background
   face difficulties being nominated, in particular in the case of parties
   with rather traditionalist societal policy positions. We also find that
   intersectionality matters: female aspirants of ethnic minorities are
   even less likely to be nominated by ideologically traditional parties.},

Abstract = {Multilevel polities do not typically facilitate secession, so why did
   the European Union adopt Article 50? Revisiting formative debates from
   the 2003 Convention on the Future of Europe, we combine archival
   research with an original dataset of delegate debates over two levels:
   the existence and procedural operation of an exit article. This reveals
   essential new detail on the genealogy of Article 50. We locate this
   institutional innovation within a Rokkanian-Hirschmanian theoretical
   framework which treats exit closure as necessary for loyalty and
   resilience. Further refining this `polity' perspective, we find many
   participants showed awareness of the potentially disruptive implications
   of an exit article. Yet, given extant tensions around `ever closer
   union', a Eurocentric procedural design prevailed as a safety valve,
   granting EU authorities default control over any exit process. This
   European logic of `controlled opening' offers a potential blueprint for
   other integrating compound polities and international organizations
   facing backlashes from member states.},

Title = {Socialized with ``old cleavages{''} or ``new dimensions{''}: An
   Age-Period-Cohort analysis on electoral support in Western European
   multiparty systems (1949-2021){*}},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {87},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Across Western Europe, the electoral base of formerly dominating parties
   on the left and the right has been eroding in the past decades. In
   contrast, both far-right parties and green parties could expand their
   vote share in numerous elections all over Western Europe - especially
   among younger voters. Still, those transformations in multiparty systems
   remain understudied: Are those electoral differences representing a
   cohort effect within the left and within the right bloc? This study uses
   survey data from ten Western European countries spanning over 60 years
   to test for cohort differences in political blocs. By applying
   multilevel logistic regression models and generalized additive mixed
   models, the analysis yields generational differences within the left and
   the right, with more recent cohorts being more likely to vote for greens
   than other left-wing and more likely to prefer the farright over other
   right-wing parties. Those results shed light on the cohort-driven
   electoral realignment in Western Europe.},

Abstract = {As judicial elections become increasingly expensive, recusal has emerged
   as a way to address concerns about the impartiality of judges who
   receive contributions from lawyers or potential litigants. While it is
   unclear if strict recusal rules are the best remedy for conflicts of
   interest created by contributions, they may disincentivize potential
   donors from investing in judicial campaigns by negating their potential
   goal of influencing decisions. We consider whether donor behavior in
   judicial campaigns - especially for those donors most likely to be
   interested in specifically currying favor with judges - responds to
   differences in recusal standards. Using data from 219 state supreme
   court races in 22 states from 2010 to 2020, we find that states with
   stricter recusal rules attract fewer campaign donations to judicial
   races, and states with more lax rules attract more overall and, most
   especially, for attorney donors.},

Abstract = {This article introduces and demonstrates the utility of a new event
   dataset on democratic erosion around the world. Through case studies of
   Turkey and Brazil, we show that our Democratic Erosion Event Dataset
   (DEED) can help to resolve debates about the extent to which democracy
   is backsliding based on prominent cross-national indicators, focusing in
   particular on the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) and Little and Meng
   (L\&M) indices. V-Dem suggests that democracies are deteriorating
   worldwide; L\&M argue that this may be an artifact of subjectivity and
   coder bias and that more ``objective{''} indicators reveal little to no
   global democratic backsliding in recent years. Using DEED, we show
   that-at least in these cases-objective indices may underestimate the
   extent of democratic erosion whereas subjective indices may overestimate
   it. Our analyses illustrate the ways in which DEED can complement
   existing indices by illuminating the nature and dynamics of democratic
   erosion as it occurs on the ground.},

Abstract = {In democratic societies, cultural organizations function based on
   principles of freedom of expression. In non-democratic countries,
   promoting this fundamental value can be more challenging for such
   organizations and their actors. This paper explores potential
   interactions between structure and agency that can leverage freedom of
   expression, creating an environment conducive to development and
   creativity. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with human rights
   experts and employees of Dawit Isaak Library in Malmo, Sweden. The paper
   finds that capitalizing on freedom of expression is interdependent with
   other resources, and that financial autonomy is an essential aspect.
   This can be achieved through various means, including strategic
   partnerships, careful sponsorships, collaborations with like-minded
   cultural entities, and the establishment of independent financial
   foundations through endowment funds and crowdfunding initiatives. We
   argue that it is crucial to strengthen the efforts of institutions
   active in this domain while supporting individuals' and groups' agency
   to create change in non-democratic societies. The paper also emphasizes
   the role of cultural and symbolic capital, highlighting the significance
   of exercising caution and striking a balance between freedom of
   expression and other human rights principles to prevent conflicts and
   safeguard vulnerable groups' rights.},

Title = {Partisanship, blame avoidance behaviours and voter reactions to
   allegations of political misconduct},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {87},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Politicians often engage in blame avoidance behaviours in order to evade
   electoral punishment following allegations of misconduct. A key question
   concerns the (in)effectiveness of such behaviours in mitigating voter
   opinions about the alleged misconduct and the appropriate punishment. In
   this article, we examine how this (in) effectiveness may be shaped by:
   (1) the characteristics of blame avoidance behaviours, and (2) voters'
   partisan (mis)alignment with the alleged offender. We address this
   question using a between -subject survey experiment among a sample of
   Norwegian citizens (N = 1996). Our main findings suggest that blame
   avoidance behaviours can be effective in mitigating voters' assessment
   of the alleged misconduct and of the punishment the politician should

Abstract = {While ``backsliding democracy{''} has been part of European topicality
   and academic debate for more than a decade, few works have approached it
   from the perspective of political philosophy and the question of the
   corruption of the democratic regime in the context of a federation. The
   Tocquevillian idea of the ``tyranny of the majority{''} makes such a
   contribution possible both from the political and institutional point of
   view and from the societal and historical point of view. In fact, if the
   EU wants to play the game of democracy, it must necessarily confront the
   pitfalls of such a regime.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the origins, the state-of-the-art and prospects of
   the new research field within critical geopolitics - popular
   geopolitics. The article aims to summarize the basic premises of popular
   geopolitics and demonstrate its relevance for analyzing, predicting and
   modeling modern geopolitical processes. Popular geopolitics focuses on
   geopolitical narratives that are translated through mediated images and
   objectified through mass culture products. It is precisely through
   popular culture, in particular through pop culture narratives that
   cross-cultural communication of the globalization era occurs. As part of
   this process cultural differences are either perceived as markers of
   otherness or, on the contrary, enable the consumer/spectator to
   reconsider the ``self-other{''} boundaries and let the culturally
   attractive ``others{''} in. As for geopolitical narratives, they
   introduce a clear demarcation between ``self{''} and ``others{''} by
   assigning to them opposite developmental trajectories that symbolize
   progress or backwardness, rise or decline, expansion or isolation. The
   authors of the article argue that a transmedia approach could make a
   valuable contribution to popular geopolitics. On the one hand, it
   enables exploring the totality of meanings forged and transmitted over
   social and online media through visual and virtual communication
   channels. In addition, the analysis of transmedia storytelling allows us
   to investigate in depth the role of content creators and content
   consumers in the production of narratives as well as investigate
   different ways in which official geopolitical narratives can be
   perceived by both domestic and external audiences. It is also argued
   that employing mixed methodology that combines qualitative and automated
   quantitative methods of textual and audiovisual data collection and
   analysis can help realize the interdisciplinarity of popular
   geopolitics. Thus, the authors come to the conclusion that popular
   geopolitics as a research field is relevant in terms of updating the
   research agenda of political science as a whole. As for the practical
   relevance of popular geopolitics, it lies in the active reconstruction
   of social reality that enables the representatives of Russian practical
   geopolitics to forge more effectively the national ``imagined world{''}
   capable of engaging in a dialogue and resisting transnational
   narratives.},

Abstract = {The expansion of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) has
   become a focal point in global discussions, particularly regarding its
   implications for Africa. This article critically examines the
   multifaceted dimensions of the BRICS expansion and its implications for
   Africa across economic, political, and strategic realms. Drawing upon a
   comprehensive review of scholarly literature and expert opinions, the
   economic implications of the BRICS expansion, including opportunities
   for growth, investment, and development, as well as challenges related
   to trade imbalances and debt sustainability, are analysed. The article
   explores how the BRICS engagement influences regional power dynamics,
   international alignments, and global governance structures. The role of
   BRICS in advocating multipolarity and institutional, global governance
   reform is highlighted, while tensions and complexities within the bloc
   are considered. By synthesising diverse perspectives, the article offers
   insights into navigating the complexities of BRICS-Africa relations and
   provides recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders to maximise
   the benefits of this evolving partnership while mitigating risks and
   vulnerabilities.},

Abstract = {Land is a central element to the war imagination. Terrible wars and
   bloody massacres have been waged in its name. This paper aims to analyse
   its symbolic significance. Although it strongly influences the
   likelihood and intensity of war, it remains understudied and
   underestimated. Drawing on ``the theory of sacralization{''} and
   bridging a ``symbolic politics{''} framework with a conflict resolution
   perspective, the article shows the importance of recognising the
   symbolic significance of land in tryingto overcome the ``absolutisms{''}
   that have kept us trapped for so long and prevented us from imagining
   `other worlds' of conflict resolution without resorting to war. The
   article proceeds as follows: after introducing the relevance of the
   symbolic significance of land, it presents a discussion of the
   ``sacralisation of land{''} through an analysis of the Zionist
   aspiration for aJewish state.},

Abstract = {In a context of rising geoeconomic competition, the EU is embracing
   stronger industrial interventionism to address societal challenges and
   reduce external dependencies in strategic sectors. Developing this type
   of strategic industrial policy requires close government-firm relations.
   This article investigates whether and how the EU succeeds in
   articulating public-private collaboration in the pursuit of strategic
   goals by examining the role of the recently launched EU Industrial
   Alliances in clean energy technologies. We build on a ``governed
   interdependence{''} (GI) approach to assess whether the Alliances
   resemble the embedded public-private networks that are common in states
   deploying strategic industrial policy. Our findings, obtained through
   desk research, surveys, and qualitative interviews, offer a mixed
   picture. On the one hand, in line with GI, the Industrial Alliances
   provide a novel, institutionalised venue for public-private
   collaboration, led by geostrategic objectives and contributing to
   reducing information gaps and fostering policy coordination. On the
   other hand, Industrial Alliances adhere less well to a GI system in
   their composition and structure, and in their loose articulation of
   risk-socialisation mechanisms.},

   will seek to account for the political ontology with which he develops

   their understandings of the subject and the neighbor, in the respective
   considerations about the forms of relationship with the other. In this
   way we propose to develop a critical analysis of the bases with which he
   articulates his political proposals for emancipation.},

CDC and an international cohort of experts on this topic insist that it not possible using currently available methods. However, some scholars and activists claim that the science behind this statement is immaterial in the hands of over-zealous actors.

Abstract = {President Trump's haphazard decision to delegate COVID-19 vaccine
   distribution to US states set up conditions for evaluating state-level
   vaccine prioritization policies using a quasi-experimental design.
   Despite agreement on the goal, state-formulated vaccine distribution
   plans diverged beyond initial priority groups: some prioritized using
   mortality risks only (i.e., age), while others also included several
   high-exposure risk groups. After establishing that this divergence was
   driven by stochastic rather than systematic factors, I leverage it as an
   identification strategy to test a key insight from network theory:
   reducing contagion requires disabling the transmission potential of the
   most connected actors. Given this, I argue that early prioritization of
   high-exposure risk groups, especially public-facing essential workers,
   led to a greater reduction in COVID-19 cases than prioritization based
   solely on mortality risks. Analysis of daily COVID-19 data in a matched
   sample of Oregon and California counties shows strong support for this
   hypothesis.},

Title = {New Breakaway Parties in Slovakia: Exploring Intra-party Democracy
   Shifts1},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Pages = {145-168},
Abstract = {Many new parties are electorally succeeding across European party
   systems, including in post-communist countries. This is especially true
   in Slovakia, where it is accompanied by another very specific
   phenomenon, which in our perspective defines recent parliamentary
   elections - the prevalence of new breakaway parties. These newly formed
   parties created by splitting from parliamentary parties are now
   competing alongside them in early parliamentary elections. The 20202023
   period, in addition to seeing the fall of governments, and a general
   political crisis and instability, was also characterized by frequent
   party factionalism. During this period, turbulent development within
   SMER-SD,\& Lcaron;SNS and O \& Lcaron;aNO translated into the formation
   of three new parties - HLAS-SD, Republika, and the Democrats, which
   represent our case studies. The aim of our paper is to analyse how these
   new breakaway parties differ from their original parties
   organizationally, in the processes associated with intra-party democracy
   (IPD). We empirically explore their leadership selection, candidate
   selection and membership policies. The existing data (based on the
   Populism and Political Parties Database) indicate that their three
   parent parties are highly personalized with low IPD. The findings of our
   comparative analysis reveal that the new breakaway parties have
   incorporated more transparent approaches to intraparty processes
   compared to their parent parties. However, concerning candidate
   selection, they have not embraced greater inclusiveness than the parties
   they originated from. Overall, despite a noticeable trend towards
   intra-party depersonalization, the opportunity for a broader membership
   base to participate in the decision-making process remains largely
   unrealized.},

Abstract = {Populists are often anti-elitist and advocate for popular will over
   expertise. We show that these two populist characteristics are responses
   to mainstream parties leaving behind the majority of voters, the common
   people. Our model highlights two forces behind electoral success:
   numbers, which favor the common people, and knowledge, which favors the
   elite. Electoral competition may lead parties to cater to the elite. We
   identify conditions under which an elite bias encourages entry with an
   anti-elite platform. Finally, we identify conditions under which parties
   follow the common people's opinion when that group would benefit from
   parties relying on experts.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {The mental health situation in Kenya has been termed a silent epidemic
   threatening the mental wellbeing of the population. Deeply entrenched
   stigma and discrimination is systematic and directly influences access
   to mental health care, human rights violations, and social exclusion.
   Despite commitments to improve mental health care infrastructure, the
   ongoing impact of colonization perpetuates biomedical responses to
   mental health. Kenya ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons
   with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008 though mental health, criminal, and
   civil laws continue to be in violation of the Convention. We take a
   human rights and equity lens to critically analyze the biomedical
   dominance in mental health policy and practice. We employ an
   intersectional analytic framework to contextualize experiences of mental
   health injustices and apply aspects of an Intersectionality Based Policy
   Analysis Framework to the Ministry of Health's Kenya Mental Health
   Policy 2015-2030 (2015) and the Ministry of East African Community (EAC)
   Labour and Social Protection's National Plan of Action on Implementation
   of Recommendations made by the Committee on the Rights of Persons with
   Disabilities (2016) to explore how policy discourses influence
   understandings of mental health and responses. We analyze a disjuncture
   between human rights and social determinants framings of mental health
   in policy, and how a default to western biomedical solutions for
   addressing mental distress dominate institutionally and in practice. We
   urge the Kenyan government to abolish coercive mental health practices,
   remove systemic barriers that hinder participation, and establish
   supports to empower people with psychosocial disabilities and their
   organizational representatives (USP-Kenya) to ensure mental health
   responses are consistent with international human rights treaties.},

Abstract = {Conceptual disagreement has been recognized as a key feature of language
   since time immemorial. Yet, no attempt has been made to measure the
   degree of conceptual disagreement that exists or to compile a list of
   concepts identified as essentially contested. Accordingly, it is unclear
   how one might distinguish contested from uncontested concepts or test
   propositions about the causes of contestation. This research note begins
   by introducing an approach to measuring conceptual contestation within
   social science. Next, we explore factors that may help to explain
   variation in conceptual contestation. We find that the characteristics
   of concepts-their value, abstraction, and normativity-explain most of
   the variability in conceptual contestation.},

Abstract = {In many countries, public sector employees are eligible to hold
   political offices during their employment as civil servants. This often
   triggers conflict-of-interest concerns that elected public employees
   might sway policies to their professional benefit. In this article, we
   build on representation scholarship in political science and public
   administration to assess such substantive effects of public employees'
   political representation using detailed Norwegian administrative
   register and survey data (2003-19). Our main results indicate that
   public employees differ little from other members within their party in
   terms of ideology and policy preferences. They do, however, appear to
   move their party slightly toward the left of the political spectrum,
   consistent with preference spillover effects induced by heightened
   public sector representation. Finally, using an instrumental variable
   approach exploiting close elections, we find that political
   representation of public employees is associated with at best modest
   public spending, employment, and wage effects at the local level.},

Abstract = {This article investigates voter responsiveness to the world's largest
   rural roads program, a highly visible development program that improved
   connectivity for one-third of humanity that previously lacked road
   access. Investigating 180,000 roads provided across half a million
   Indian villages aggregated across multiple elections over the last 20
   years, the article finds that road provision fails to boost electoral
   support for the ruling party. Exploiting population-based implementation
   rules that partly determine road allocation, instrumental variable
   regressions show that voters remain unresponsive to exogenous road
   provision. Exploiting subnational variation in implementation and
   political alignment, analysis shows that factors that breakdown the
   accountability chain, such as quality, salience, myopia, corruption, or
   attribution concerns, do not explain these results. The findings suggest
   that weak accountability presents a more enduring challenge to democracy
   than assumed in theoretical models and policy interventions.},

Title = {The Spanish Constitutional Court and flaws of legislative technique.},
Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {53},
Abstract = {For some years now, in some European countries the decline in the
   quality of laws has come to be perceived as a threat to the rule of law.
   For this reason, some constitutional courts have abandoned their usual
   self-restraint in the review of defects in legislative technique in
   order to carry out a more intense control in this regard. Thus, in
   Germany, France and Italy, on the basis of very general constitutional
   provisions, the constitutional courts use parameters such as
   comprehensibility, accessibility and clarity of the laws, and in more
   recent years declarations of unconstitutionality have become relatively
   common. This paper focuses on examining the constitutional jurisprudence
   on the principle of legal certainty explicitly enshrined in the Spanish
   Constitution, with the main objective of assessing whether our
   Constitutional Court also joins this tendency to control the lack of
   quality of laws more strictly.},

Abstract = {The exhumation of mass graves in today's Spain is not a recent event.
   During the Franco dictatorship, the regime recovered the bodies of their
   war dead, martyred victims and fallen soldiers for God and Country , and
   buried them with honour and distinction. But the families of murdered
   Republicans were not even allowed to reclaim their loved ones' remains.
   The battered bodies were abandoned in unmarked mass graves without
   ceremony; families were not allowed to perform public acts of grief.
   This article is an ethnographic study of the exhumations of these
   victims of the 1936 military uprising in the province of C \&
   aacute;diz; it presents a comparative analysis of the evolution of this
   process during the Franco years, the Transition, and 21 st c. democracy,
   in terms of social and political factors. For each of the three time
   periods, the author provides two representative case studies that
   highlight demands to recover and honour the memory of the dead. This
   struggle has its origins during the Franco dictatorship but continues
   today as unfinished business.},

Abstract = {After a general overview of the context of the 2023 general election in
   Slovakia, the article provides a detailed analysis of the electoral
   results and support for political parties. Using both aggregate and
   individual level data, we show that the results were influenced by a
   combination of long-term features defining electoral support and voting
   behaviour in Slovakia and a more recent trend including weaker
   ideological attachment and the increased importance of leadership
   personality for political party preference. Also, it seems that the
   illiberal mobilization may be traced in the dynamic of electoral shifts
   in the context of different behaviour of various societal groups.
   Moreover, the return of illiberal actors to power in Slovakia seems to
   have been characterized by a surge of votes for conservative or populist
   left-wing forces in the larger Slovak cities. Although this is not
   reflected in the turnout, at the individual level we can assume that
   liberal voters turned out in smaller numbers, while Smer voters may have
   been more mobilized, or some voters may have switched from other
   populist parties such as O \& Lcaron;aNO.},

Title = {Different Perspectives on Democracy as an Explanation for the ``Populist
   Radical Right Gender Gap{''}?},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {The ``radical right gender gap{''} is an established finding in
   contemporary research, indicating that women support populist radical
   right parties (PRRPs) in significantly lower numbers than men. Despite
   substantial literature dedicated to uncovering the reasons behind this
   gap, significant questions remain unanswered. This article examines the
   nature of the radical right gender gap in greater detail, focusing on
   Switzerland-a country with one of the most established PRRPs in Western
   Europe, the SVP/SPP (Schweizer Volkspartei/Swiss People's Party), making
   it a representative case. A defining feature of PRRPs that sets them
   apart from other parties is their clear distinction between in-groups
   and out-groups in society, coupled with the propagation of nativist and
   anti-pluralist values. While PRRPs emphasize caring for the in-group,
   they often advocate excluding the out-group from rights and privileges.
   This article argues that the preferences of PRRPs and female voters are
   in stark contrast regarding these issues. Building on empirical evidence
   that women place more importance on certain features of a democratic
   system than men do, we propose that this discrepancy may help explain
   the gender gap in support for these parties. Utilizing data from the
   European Social Survey 2020, which includes detailed questions on
   various understandings of democracy, we find robust support for our
   hypotheses within the Swiss context. Compared to men, women consider
   protecting the rights of minorities and safeguarding all citizens from
   poverty as especially important for a functioning democracy. These
   preferences emerge as influential factors contributing to women's
   reluctance to support PRRPs.},

Abstract = {This study is theoretically anchored in the office-seeking approach and
   coalition theory of political science. It is based on the most
   widespread theories of portfolio distribution in executive and
   legislative bodies (proportionality, power index, voting weights), and
   it tests these theories using data related to coalition negotiations in
   the Czech Republic for the new 2021 government coalition, a case of a
   surplus majority government. The study investigates the distribution of
   ministerial positions in the government, the office of President
   (Speaker) of the Chamber of Deputies, and the chairs of permanent
   parliamentary committees. The analysis also explores the types of
   electoral coalitions formed; the SPOLU coalition was a superadditive
   coalition, while the PirSTAN coalition was only an additive coalition.
   Grounded in the theory of electoral games, the Shapley-Shubik and
   Banzhaf power indices and the theory of coalition formation are applied
   in order to analyse the possible minimal winning coalitions that could
   be formed following the 2021 elections to the Chamber of Deputies.},

   Anti-Political Right Wing},
Journal = {DESAFIOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The main argument of this paper is that in the 2022 presidential
   elections in Colombia an anti-politics right, represented by Rodolfo
   Hernandez. It was a new right that combined a neoliberal ideology with
   an anti-politics discourse. This new right differed from the traditional
   right in Colombia represented by the Conservative Party and el uribismo
   in two important aspects; it did not enjoy a clear conservative
   dimension and it articulated a strong criticism of the Colombian
   political class. The emergence of this new right was ignored by the
   majority of academics and the Colombian media, who did not take
   seriously the political project represented by Rodolfo Hernandez in
   2022, classifying it as an ephemeral and personalistic populism that
   lacked ideological and programmatic coherence. Our analysis, however,
   shows that the electoral discourse of Rodolfo Hernandez was not populist
   even though it did have a strong anti-politics dimension. Far from being
   ideologically incoherent, Hernandez articulated a clear right-wing
   ideology in opposition to the left-wing populism represented by Gustavo
   Petro.},

Title = {THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE WORLD ORDER: THE EVOLUTIONARY ASPECT},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {4},
Pages = {146-165},
Abstract = {Within the framework of the methodology of system modeling and concept
   analysis, as well as by using a previously developed model of
   evolutionary cycles of the world political and economic system,
   supplemented by a model of transmission of leadership and its
   dysfunctions in the vicinity of the ``singularity{''} of global
   development, a hypothesis has been formulated to explain the features of
   the current degradation of the unipolar world order, clarifying its time
   frame and possible cumulative geo-economic and geopolitical
   consequences. The possibility of evolutionary transformation of the
   unipolar world order into a different kind of global order, built on
   fundamentally different organizational principles, which are not
   hierarchical, but rather structured like a network, is explored. Among
   the systemic reasons for such degradation, the most important are,
   firstly, the evolutionary dead end of the monopolar design of a complex
   system. Within the framework of such a system, both organic transmission
   of leadership and institutional and normative-value continuity between
   the elites of the old and new leader are impossible. Under these
   circumstances, the hegemon of the monopolar world order is forced,
   driven by the interests of self-preservation, to destroy the foundations
   of the system it itself created. Another no less important systemic
   reason pointing to the inevitability of ``creative destruction{''} of
   the traditional hierarchically organized world order is the inertia of
   the prospects for global development for the subjects and actors of
   world politics operating today, as well as the structural and functional
   ``poverty{''} of mainstream models of world socio-political and economic
   changes in the coordinates of global ordering/disordering. Based on the
   analysis of the primary symptoms of the widespread awakening of actors
   to subjective activity that has swept the entire modern world,
   qualitatively new communities have been identified - growth points of
   new orders, proto-institutions, norms and value orientations, potential
   structures of political subjectivity.},

   PHILOSOPHY - POLITICAL SCIENCE: ARTICULATION OF THE PROBLEM AREA},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-66},
Abstract = {The article attempts to provide a definition for the problem area of the
   philosophy of politics, political philosophy and political science.
   Given the lack of a well-established distinction between the subjects of
   these sciences in the Russian-language discourse, the author turns to
   the English-language tradition. The analysis of this discourse shows the
   following: 1) the absence of a distinction between political philosophy
   and the philosophy of politics, which is replaced by political ontology
   as part of political philosophy; 2) the existence of a distinction
   between political theory and political philosophy; 3) the dependence of
   the paradigm of the relationship between political theory and political
   philosophy on the consensus developed in the national intellectual
   tradition. In the English-language discourse, the question of the
   relationship between political science and political philosophy comes to
   the fore. The latter is considered as a subordinate, integral part of
   political science. It is shown that, based on the criterion of
   ``insufficient scientificity{''}, attempts to exclude political
   philosophy from the political science do not stop. The article
   substantiates the position according to which, despite their apparent
   similarity, the subjects of political science and political philosophy
   do not coincide - the disciplinary ontology of political science can
   become the subject of political philosophy. When discussing the
   relationship between the philosophy of politics and political
   philosophy, the article presents several hypotheses. First, a
   distinction is made between the philosophy of politics and political
   philosophy and the author argues that they are distinct. Secondly, the
   position, according to which the philosophy of politics belongs to the
   field of philosophy, and political philosophy to political science, is
   critically examined, and the fact that the two disciplines belong to the
   philosophical corpus of knowledge is substantiated. Thirdly, it is
   proposed to demarcate between the philosophy of politics and political
   philosophy in accordance with the difference between their subjects. The
   subject of philosophy of politics is the phenomenon of the political,
   while the subject of political philosophy is political phenomena.},

Title = {A Conceptual Framework for National Dialogues: Applied Theories and
   Concepts},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {National dialogues are increasingly recognised as vital tools for
   resolving political conflicts, fostering state- and nation-building,
   enhancing social cohesion, and facilitating peaceful socio-economic and
   political transformation. Despite a growing body of literature examining
   national dialogues and their outcomes, there remains a gap in
   understanding their theoretical underpinnings and conceptualisations.
   This article addresses this gap by conducting a discursive analysis
   offering an alternative theoretical framework for national dialogues,
   drawing on three theories: social contract, consociationalism, and
   conflict transformation. Using secondary data from scholarly journals,
   reports, political agreements, and documented policies and strategies,
   this article assesses the theories' applicability in developing a robust
   conceptual framework for national dialogues. An analysis of each theory
   demonstrates that, while they approach peacebuilding from different
   angles, they share unique and common themes such as participatory
   governance, addressing root causes, and building trust and cooperation,
   which are essential in designing and implementing successful national
   dialogues. Leveraging the unique elements of each theory, the observed
   insights provide a more comprehensive approach to planning and
   implementing national dialogues, even in diverse socio-economic and
   political contexts. The findings' implications are pertinent to scholars
   in the field of peace studies, governments, political entities, civil
   society organisations, and international stakeholders engaged in
   national dialogue processes.},

Title = {HUBRIS SYNDROME AND TECHNOLOGIES OF DELEGITIMATION OF POWER},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {1},
Pages = {36-51},
Abstract = {. The authors refer to the concept of hubris syndrome, introduced into
   political lexicon in the 2010s by D. Owen, and understood as a specific
   disease of ``people of power.{''} The hypothesis of the study is that
   the attribution of hubris syndrome to a leader by the media and within
   expert discourse is not based on objective criteria, but is manipulative
   in nature and is determined by the degree of ``perverseness of the
   political course{''} in terms of its compliance or non-compliance with
   universal democratic values. The article reveals the mechanisms of
   delegitimization of power through the assignment of a number of
   characteristics to it within the framework of hubris syndrome. As the
   analysis shows, hubris syndrome is an exclusively political
   construction, which is broadcast to the general public as a medical
   concept. Arguments about hubris syndrome are always built on the basis
   of the oppositional pair ``democracy - authoritarianism / tyranny{''},
   as it is understood that democratic regimes themselves, due to their
   immanent properties (multi-stage institutions of control, change of
   power, openness, etc.), usually prevent the development of hubris.
   Reversely, authoritarian and tyrannical regimes automatically turn out
   to be hubristic ones, which allows democratic regimes, by the right of
   moral superiority, to correct them in different ways that may even lead
   to intervention and interference. This scheme finds a historical analogy
   to the application of the concept of civilizational peoples and states
   in the civilization/barbarism dichotomy in the 18th-19th centuries,
   which played a similar function for the West, as described by S.
   Huntington. The discrepancy between the formal definition of hubris
   syndrome and the use of the concept in politics is obvious. A highly
   manipulative construct embodies the tactics of de-legitimization of a
   political leader if he/ she ceases to comply with the norms of a certain
   cultural and historical chronotope. The authors draw attention to the
   specific linguistic markers of hubris syndrome in political
   communication and the ways in which any politician whose speech contains
   these units can be declared suffering from hubris syndrome.},

Abstract = {The politics of the United States, both internal and external, and the
   analysis of its historiosophic foundations, topical subjects, trends and
   prospects of development have occupied a special place in the Russian
   school of international relations. On the one hand, interest in this
   topic has always been determined by its applied nature: for most of the
   20th century, the USA was the main adversary of the USSR, and today the
   relations between the two countries are in a state of systemic
   confrontation, albeit of a different kind. On the other hand, with its
   history, economics, culture, ideology and politics, the USA as an
   experimental state and laboratory society has always been a field of
   scientific research and an object of intellectual reflection for
   researchers of all socio-humanitarian disciplines. All these works
   reveal different facets of American reality, but for Russian
   Americanists among historians and political scientists, those that allow
   them to find a key to understanding the driving forces of American
   politics and to forecast its development are especially valuable. The
   interview with leading Russian Historian-Americanist Dr. V.O. Pechatnov
   is an attempt to understand these key issues.},

Abstract = {Does individual variation in affective empathetic capacity systemically
   condition a person's willingness to support pre-emptive military action?
   In this note, I theorize that individuals who are more prone to feeling
   affective empathy are less likely to support conflict escalation. To
   evidence this theory, I conduct a survey asking individuals about their
   willingness to support a military attack against a non-specific rogue
   state that is on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons. The results
   demonstrate that the probability of an individual supporting such a
   strike is strongly conditioned on their affective empathetic capacity.
   This finding holds regardless of model specification and controlling for
   rational beliefs about material outcomes. Affective empathy may,
   therefore, have a powerful palliating effect upon the processes that
   contribute to conflict escalation.},

Abstract = {The article argues that Michel Foucault's frequently stated opposition
   between his ``genealogy of norms{''} and the Marxist ``critique of
   ideology{''} is, in many ways, unfounded. By analyzing some of his
   texts, I claim that Foucault's objections to the critique of ideology
   conceal his creative use of Karl Marx's and Friedrich Engels' insights.
   To support this claim, I first identify some ``Marxist echoes{''} in
   Foucault's work. I then demonstrate that these echoes lead to original
   reformulations of the critique of ideology, which are not reducible to
   Louis Althusser's theory of the ``ideological apparatuses{''}. Thus, the
   article highlights that Foucault's ``genealogy of norms{''} is
   surprisingly connected to Marx's and Engels' hypotheses presented in the
   manuscripts known as The German Ideology.},

Abstract = {Schmitt's flagship project of political theology has recently become the
   subject of widespread discussion in political philosophy. One of the
   trends that has emerged in the interpretations of this project is
   associated with criticism of Carl Schmitt's political-theological
   approach itself. An increasing number of authors see political theology
   as a serious challenge for modernity, considering it a tool for
   justifying and legitimizing state violence. Therefore, there is a need
   to overcome political-theological logic and turn to other strategies for
   thinking about the political. At the same time, the question of
   resources that could act as an alternative to Schmitt's project is
   becoming more relevant. The article proves that anarchist theory can
   become such a resource. The author, however, does not mean its classical
   version, reflected in the works of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Mikhail
   Bakunin. Having reconstructed Schmitt's vision of anarchism, he shows
   that, although the German philosopher's interpretation of anarchist
   theory was not completely correct, Schmitt was not entirely wrong when
   he called the classical anarchists of the 19th th century
   anti-theological theologians and anti-dictatorship dictators, qualifying
   them as inverted counterparts to the theorists of state absolutism.
   However, anarchist thought is not confined to the attitudes of the
   followers of Bakunin and Proudhon. Thus, the author turns to the concept
   of Gustav Landauer, the German anarchist of the early 20th th century,
   demonstrating that it is free from the inherent flaws of classical
   anarchism and presupposes a model of political thinking that is
   fundamentally different from Schmitt's model, being located outside the
   political-theological frame. According to his conclusion, being free
   from political and theological assumptions, this model allows one to
   talk about politics and the social outside of the usual terms, such as
   state, power, domination, and subordination, moving rather towards the
   idea of autonomous communities, excluded from the current state order
   and at the same time coexisting with such order.},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {7-23},
Abstract = {This paper analyses the mobilization of Czech civil society in response
   to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, focusing on how selected
   non-governmental organizations framed the conflict in their public
   communications. Drawing on framing theory and employing a qualitative
   content analysis of websites and Facebook posts, we explore the
   diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational frames used by six Czech NGOs
   across the first two years of the war. Our findings reveal a marked
   divergence between humanitarian organizations, which emphasized
   individual suffering and aid delivery without politicization, and
   initiatives aimed at purchasing military equipment, which engaged in
   explicitly political and moral framing. While the former largely avoided
   attributing blame or invoking democratic values, the latter employed war
   rhetoric and mobilized public support through appeals to collective
   security. The study also captures the temporal shift in public

   the second year of the conflict. We argue that the framing strategies
   adopted by civil society actors were shaped both by their organizational

Abstract = {In an era marked by numerous conflicts and human rights violations, this
   article provides a comprehensive review of transitional justice studies,
   assessing the evolution of the field and exploring potential future
   directions. It addresses several critical questions: How has the field
   of transitional justice developed, and what factors have influenced its
   changes over time? What tools and techniques have been employed, and
   what challenges and achievements have they revealed? What significant
   lessons and recommendations have emerged from existing studies, and why
   are they important? Finally, the article also considers normative
   aspirations for future cases of transitional justice, particularly in
   the context of Russia's war against Ukraine. This analysis underscores
   the belief that academic self-reflection is valuable not only for
   students and researchers but also for national and international actors
   involved in implementing transitional justice strategies.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the recruitment of the heads of law enforcement
   agencies in Russian regions. The authors collected extensive
   biographical dataset on all the heads of the prosecutor's office and the
   Ministry of Interior in Russian regions in the post-Soviet period, which
   made it possible to identify the main patterns for the appointments,
   transfers among the regions and taking positions in the executive and
   legislative power bodies and the business after their retirement. The
   research shows that regional law enforcement agencies are characterized
   by strictly centralized recruitment that minimizes the ties between the
   heads of law enforcement services in the regions and local elites. At
   the same time, few regions with strong local elites and privileged
   relations with the federal center are able to promote their own
   representatives to top positions. The study also reveals the formation
   of clienteles associated with natives of certain areas, whose
   representatives occupy positions in a large number of federal subjects,
   as well as in the central office. The research shows that the
   strengthening of centralization in the law enforcement agencies in
   Russia is interconnected with the creation of such federal-local
   clienteles with regional roots and their change when federal heads of
   law enforcement agencies are replaced which the authors interpret as
   patronage.},

   racialization of the prison order},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2024},
Number = {146},
Pages = {219-243},
Abstract = {In France, two areas of works on racial categorization in prisons have
   emerged, and both have struggled to find a convincing way of addressing
   the issue: on the one hand, those who focus on the prison continuum in
   order to understand the interlocking logics of social and racial
   exclusion between prisons and working-class neighbourhoods; and on the
   other, those who examine racialisation only through the prism of the
   conditions under which racist statements are made. By examining the way
   in which prison staff designate and group inmates in terms of their
   place of residence and the networks of acquaintances associated with it,
   the article looks at the intertwined effects of the processes of
   racialisation and territorialization on the way in which inmates are
   assigned to prison. Based on an ethnographic survey of two French
   prisons, it shows how territorial categorization applied to young men
   from working-class backgrounds reproduces forms of racialization and
   disqualification of prisoners targeted by practices of cell grouping
   practices. The latitude given to prison management staff in the
   assignments therefore appears to be decisive. In the two prisons
   surveyed, this led to the establishment of ``balancing{''} standards in
   the composition of units, revealing a pragmatic process of racialisation
   structuring the prison order.},

Abstract = {Research on the formation of transnational social movements primarily
   view these as either exile support of a local movement or mobilization
   around an international issue. This article presents a different
   argument for transnational activism drawing on the logic of the
   repression-dissent nexus when considering the combination of online and
   offline performances of contemporary social movements. The starting
   point is that membership in online communities constitutes a social
   identity for potential protest participants that can be activated and
   politicized when states' seek to repress access and content to online
   interaction. Since online communities are borderless by nature, we
   suggest that when regimes employ online repression due to local protests
   then we will see a backlash that will facilitate the formation of a
   transnational social movement. We illustrate our argument with an
   empirical discussion about how the anti-government protests in Thailand
   in 2020 became part of and facilitated a growing transnational social
   movement of youth discontent with regimes in Southeast and East Asia.
   The example shows that the impetus for increasing transnational
   co-operation throughout the process was in response to growing
   repression by the Thai authorities both of online content and on the
   street.},

Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 26},
Abstract = {There is a growing research interest in the role of social media in
   armed conflicts, but the impact of social media on the persistence of
   the renewed Biafra separatist conflict in Nigeria has not been
   sufficiently examined. This study attempts to fill this gap. Using
   realism and securitization theories, this research demonstrated that
   ethnic entrepreneurs like the Biafra separatist leader, Nnamdi Kanu,
   often take advantage of the lack of gatekeepers in social media to
   mobilize the support required to sustain ethnic conflicts. Unlike other
   pro-Biafra movements in the past that fizzled out with time, Kanu's
   Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has generated sustained attention
   because it leverages social media to mobilize local and international
   support. In the absence of Kanu due to state incarceration since 2021,
   his self-styled disciple, Simon Ekpa, has continued in Kanu's footsteps,
   using social media to sustain the movement. The user-generated content
   nature of social media makes it fashionable to be used by ethnic
   entrepreneurs to accelerate the onset of armed conflict. This research
   suggests that multiethnic states like Nigeria can delay the onset of
   civil wars and insurgencies by regulating social media use without
   suppressing dissident voices and restricting individual liberty.},

   {[}Anonymous], 17 Records of the 47th NCB, Report on Coral for use as Airplane Runways or Roads, RG 1, Box 1, NAVFAC Archive. This report was prepared by M.E. Milone, CCM(AA) USNR and submitted through channels to the Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks by letter dated 12 Oct 43 and endorsed by the acting OiC of the 47th NCB. There are several other good references on coral and coral airstrips but this is by far the best detailed on actual construction technique and very specific to the experience at Segi Point. It was written and submitted ``hoping that it may be of some use to other construction battalions who may have the same type of material.{''} Additional information of coral airstrip construction is contained in the chapter, written by Nathan Bowers, ``Airfields of Coral{''} in Bulldozers Come First: The Story of US War Construction in Foreign Lands (McGraw-Hill: New York, 1944). This is a very detail description of the various construction methods used by the Seabees throughout the Pacific including standard techniques and depths of placed layers (8{''}) and final compacted layer thickness (6{''}). In this chapter Bowers also talks about the ``set up{''} time of different coral types with ``live coral{''}, that free of the clay type material at Segi, setting up in approximately 3 day and coral such as that described at Segi setting up in 5 days. This chapter is a re-written and expanded article from Engineering New Record (July 13, 1944) pp\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}. 80-85. Another article, ``Characteristics of Coral Deposits{''} by Harold T. Stearns, in the same ENR issue describes the nature and chemical properties of coral and why it will set up like concrete. This has to do with corals lime content and the presence of water and other bonding agents such as salt and volcanic ash. Volcanic ash is considered to be one of the ingredients in the ``mud{''} from on land coral deposits such as those at Segi which actually could have aided in the set up..

Abstract = {Housing shortages and rising rents have increased demands for affordable
   housing. In this paper, we examine whether electoral constraints can
   undermine local politicians' incentives to build public housing.
   Empirically, we draw on the full-count census of all housing built in
   Germany, data on 19,685 local elections between 1989 and 2011, and an
   original survey. Using a difference-in-differences design, we
   demonstrate that incumbents are not rewarded, but rather experience
   moderate electoral losses after constructing new public housing. We then
   show that these losses are not primarily driven by homeowner opposition
   or native-foreigner competition. Instead, electoral punishment is
   largest in economically disadvantaged municipalities with relatively
   affordable housing, as voters prioritize spending in other local policy
   areas that are crowded out by public housing. Survey evidence
   demonstrates that electoral constraints emerge when voters' short-term
   spending preferences conflict with municipalities' long-term goals to
   provide affordable housing.},

Journal = {LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {While academics have examined how term limits affect elected officials,
   little work has gone into understanding the way they alter challenger
   behavior. I argue that they reduce the number of candidates who
   challenge incumbents, leading to a lock-in effect. By increasing the
   frequency of open races, term limits incentivize potential challengers
   to wait for an open race. To demonstrate this, I analyze primary data
   from 85 legislative chambers in 44 states over a two-decade period to
   see how term limits alter challenger entry patterns. I show that
   term-limited incumbents face fewer challengers in their last two terms
   in office and challenges are weaker, while competition for open races
   ramps up. In doing so, I provide a major insight into how term limits
   alter challenger decision-making to run for entry-level office while
   improving our understanding of candidate entry by accounting for
   multiple potential points of entry.},

Abstract = {Empathy has been proposed as a solution to alleviate interparty
   antipathy. Recent findings from the US suggest that one aspect of
   empathy - empathic concern - increases rather than decreases affective
   polarization. Perspective-taking, another aspect of empathy, has no
   effect on affective polarization. In this article, we describe a
   preregistered replication and extension of these findings in the
   contrasting political context of the Netherlands, to see whether this
   relationship generalizes beyond the US. First, using a cross-sectional
   nationally representative sample of 1,258 Dutch voters, we show that
   empathic concern indeed fuels affective polarization while at the same
   time we find that perspective-taking reduces it. Second, using a two-arm
   survey experiment (n = 438), we show that perspective-taking reduces
   ingroup bias, whereas empathic concern does not. Reflecting on the
   American and Dutch findings, we conclude that while empathic concern
   likely contributes to affective polarization, perspective-taking may
   reduce it.},

   Wagenknecht-An Analysis Based on Panel Data},

Volume = {66},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Despite its recent founding, the B \& uuml;ndnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW)
   has already developed into a relevant player in the German party system.
   This article provides a more comprehensive look at the BSW electorate
   based on panel data from the German Longitudinal Election Study. By
   using panel data, it is possible not only to describe the current
   attitudes of BSW supporters but also to track their changes over time.
   The analysis shows three key points: (1) The BSW is particularly popular
   with former left-wing supporters and voters who turned away from the
   established parties after the federal election of 2021 and have since
   sympathized with the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The founding
   of the BSW and the decline of the AfD in the polls are therefore linked.
   (2) The BSW closes a representation gap in the German party system.
   Already many years ago-when the founding of the BSW was not up for
   debate-respondents who now support the BSW were different from the other
   respondents, even when previous voting behavior is controlled for. This
   is particularly true for attitudes toward regulating immigration. (3)
   The BSW supporters have also previously shown critical attitudes toward
   (representative) democracy (low satisfaction with democracy and high
   populism). Overall, the results suggest that the BSW has a distinct
   electorate, which should contribute to its further establishment in the
   German party system.},

Abstract = {Democracy is assumed to require the equal political inclusion of
   denizens, as sustained political inequalities between members of society
   seemingly undermine the democratic ideal of equal freedom. This
   assumption is prominently expressed by Walzer's Principle of Political
   Justice, according to which democratic institutions must attribute equal
   political rights to denizens in order to sustain their equal protection
   from domination and the recognition required for free agency. This paper
   rejects this influential assumption. We argue that denizenship
   constitutes a social position in which equal freedom can be enjoyed
   without political inclusion on equal terms to citizens. Many denizens
   are citizens somewhere else, and enjoy status, rights, and protections
   in virtue of their external citizenship, which can protect them from
   domination and provide them with the recognitional basis of
   self-respect. The cross-border relationships between denizens and their
   home country, as well as between the host country and the home country,
   must therefore be considered when evaluating claims to political
   inclusion. Accepting the democratic legitimacy of the partial political
   inclusion of denizens allows us to focus on the most pressing political
   claims, such as those of refugees and stateless persons. Partial
   inclusion schemes can also make less restrictive immigration policies
   more rational and desirable for citizens.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a simple dynamic model that explores the
   interdependence and dynamic properties of hate, violence and economic
   well-being. It shows that a time-dependent economic growth process that
   affects the evolution of hate can yield a long-run steady state, but
   this steady state will not be free of hate and violence. Moreover, we
   show that better (long-run) economic conditions do not necessarily
   result in lower equilibrium levels of hate and violence. We also show
   that, under reasonable conditions, cycles of hate and violence cannot
   occur. Consequently, the dynamic properties of hate and violence alone
   cannot result in cyclical (net) economic well-being patterns. While
   stable and unstable equilibria are possible, the most likely equilibrium
   is a saddle point. Given its nature, we can view the paper as an example
   of a formal model for the ideas of the ``dynamical system{''} literature
   in psychology. Although the paper does not discuss policy decisions, it
   identifies potential instruments for policymakers to achieve better
   steady states and greater stability. Finally, we provide two fully
   nonlinear multi-dimensional numerical examples (in an appendix) to
   demonstrate the implications of various psychological attributes,
   sensitivity to economic conditions, externalities, violence and small
   equilibria perturbations regarding the nature of the steady state and
   stability of the equilibria.},

Abstract = {This paper argues against the claim that liberal democratic societies'
   commitment to political equality requires them to offer a path to
   citizenship to temporary migrant workers (i.e. the democratic justice
   argument). I advance two arguments against this claim: (i) that access
   to citizenship is neither sufficient nor necessary to reduce temporary
   migrant workers' exploitation and (ii) the democratic justice argument
   hinges on an untenable conception of status inequality. The paper
   fleshes out these two reasons in detail to then present an adequate
   analysis of the status difference that temporary labor migration
   programs (TLMPs) give rise to. I conclude that TLMPs' restriction of
   their participants' rights and access to citizenship can be compatible
   with democratic principles and, particularly, with political equality.},

Abstract = {Divisions among regime elites in autocracies are often an important step
   toward political liberalization. However, we know little about when such
   divisions contribute to initiating democratic reforms. We argue that
   whether elite divisions lead to liberalization depends on the historical
   origins of ruling parties. Using panel matching analyses, we show that
   the positive effects of elite divisions on political liberalization are
   significantly reduced when ruling parties originate from national
   struggles such as revolutions, insurgencies, and independence movements.
   Specifically, dictators arising from such origins can prevent elite
   divisions from sparking democratic reforms by providing ``carrots{''} to
   the military and applying ``sticks{''} to citizens and political
   opponents. These results hold after multiple robustness tests and
   additional analyses for causal mechanisms. Our findings suggest that
   party origins are critical junctures that significantly shape regime
   prospects more than regime origins suggested by the literature.},

Abstract = {Given the scarcity of women in hierarchical positions in academic
   institutions, it is worth asking whether a gender gap in publications
   precedes this issue. We examine the gender gap in publications in eight
   of the most important Political Science journals in Argentina. We
   reviewed 974 peer-reviewed articles from 144 volumes published between
   2011 and 2021, focusing on three dimensions: gender gaps in authorship,
   co-authorship patterns, and subfield affinities. Our findings suggest
   that while there is a gender gap in authorship in Political Science
   journals, it is not as significant as the gap documented in similar
   studies conducted in other countries. Furthermore, we found no evidence
   that the gender gap is due to co-authorship patterns. Finally, in terms
   of subfield affinities, our results suggest that male and female
   political scientists in Argentina have different affinities for topics
   within the field, and that journals that emphasise topics favoured by
   men have a larger gender gap.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the strategies that populists use in the media in
   contexts of civic contestations of populist government policies. The
   authors take the case study of Belgrade Waterfront protests in Serbia in
   2016, in which the dominant populist party (SNS) successfully devalued
   the protests by using tabloid press and pro-government TV news
   broadcasts. The paper argues that a successful consolidation of populist
   politics was possible only through developing deep political and media
   polarization. As a sample, the authors take a look at protests from
   April to September and analyze dominant media narratives in pro-gov
   tabloid Informer and TV Pink, cross-comparing them with critically
   oriented daily Danas and TV N1.},

Abstract = {Demilitarization always occurs as a result of critical historical
   junctures. Panama is one of only two states in the post-World War II
   era, however, that - having experienced such a formative moment -
   abolished its military and stood by that decision. The lustre of this
   extraordinary achievement may have faded in past decades, but it should
   not have. This article makes four arguments: (1) Panama had a more
   difficult task in eliminating its military than Costa Rica; (2) it has
   also faced more trying security challenges than its neighbour to the
   north; (3) despite some setbacks and problems, it has managed the
   obstacles posed by its unique environment well; and (4) Panamanians
   enjoy the benefits and strongly support their country's demilitarized
   status.},

Abstract = {Scholars widely agree that to mobilize individuals to action, it is
   vital that interest groups persuade them of the efficacy of
   participation. Despite firmly establishing the relationship between
   efficacy and action, research tells us surprisingly little about what
   kind of messaging most effectively evokes feelings of efficacy. To
   address this gap in the literature, we conduct a pair of survey
   experiments, each with three manipulations. The experiments present
   messages by fictitious advocacy organizations that emphasize the
   individual (action by an individual can produce change), the identity
   group (action by a specific identity group can produce change), or the
   organization (action by our organization can political change). Each
   message is designed to increase self-efficacy, group efficacy, or
   organizational efficacy, respectively. We conduct a two-stage analysis
   to determine first whether each message is able to increase efficacy,
   and then whether those feelings translate to behavioral support of the
   campaign. We find that while motivational messages often increase the
   intent to support a campaign, they only induce behavioral change in
   limited contexts.},

Abstract = {I argue that current normative discussions of the responsibility for
   structural injustice are marred by an inadequate socio-theoretical view
   of structures and their functioning. This view reduces the relation
   between structures and actions to one of constraint: structures mainly
   inhibit transformative action; transformative action can only come from
   outside structures. I offer an alternative view of structures and their
   functioning that, drawing on and extending Sewell's and Haslanger's
   conceptions of structures and Arendt's view of action, shows that
   actions are structurally and publicly constituted-they acquire social
   meaning in relation to structures, in a process of public
   interpretation-which is why they can transform the structures where they
   originate. Responsibility to dismantle unjust structures should then be
   understood as ``structural responsibility{''}: responsibility to act
   from one's structural position in ways that can disrupt the mechanisms
   of structural maintenance.},

Abstract = {Maps with flags have securitized China's actions in Africa. This article
   combines spatial and cartographic analysis with securitization theory to
   test the role played by visual symbols in the securitization of the East
   African space and then compares this with on-the-ground realities. It
   finds that maps with flags have decisively securitized China's presence
   and actions in East Africa for state actors with antithetical interests.
   Despite valid security concerns, securitizing China in East Africa
   conflates presence with hegemony and, thus, willfully ignores the
   sovereignty and agency of African states and peoples and simplifies East
   Africa to a zone on the map of great power contestation.},

Abstract = {In the context of traditionalist tendencies in the Russian religious
   space in 2000-2010, Salafism became the object of intense discursive
   production. Interpretations range from explicit criticism to the
   identification of its modernizing potential. The article analyzes
   various approaches at both federal and local levels, using the regions
   of Dagestan and Tatarstan as examples. Despite the politically polarized
   character of the discussion, these actors share important fundamental
   assumptions. These trends are compared with the French debate by Olivier
   Roy and Gilles Kepel and are analyzed in relation to secularization
   theories.},

Title = {Border fortification and legibility: Evidence from Afghanistan},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 3},
Abstract = {States often fortify their borders against militant threats. How do
   these efforts shape civilian welfare and perceptions in borderland
   communities? I conceptualize border fortification as a
   legibility-building endeavor. By bolstering state reach in areas of weak
   historical penetration, fortification enhances the government's capacity
   for monitoring, administration, and control. Yet, expanding state
   authority also disrupts traditional cross-border markets. A trade-off
   between security and corruption emerges in consequence. I provide
   evidence for this theory in a difference-in-differences framework,
   combining administrative records on violence and representative data
   from a NATO-commissioned survey fielded across Afghanistan.
   Fortification facilitates government information-collection, improving
   security provision and fostering civilian reliance on state forces.
   Enhanced state capacity is countervailed by negative economic impacts.
   By disturbing the informal borderland economy, fortification fuels
   criminalization and local opposition. Civilians rely on illicit economic
   entrepreneurs to sustain traditional market access. Higher smuggling
   rents fuel official corruption and bribe-taking. The findings point to a
   key dilemma inherent in border fortification strategies.},

Title = {Nordic legal overseers and institutional openness in crises: Challenges
   and adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 3},
Abstract = {We analyze challenges and adaptation strategies of Nordic legal
   overseers, the Parliamentary Ombudsmen and Chancellors of Justice in
   Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, amid the COVID-19 crisis. We study
   how the accountability capacities of the legal overseers were affected
   when standard practices of inclusive decision-making were severed, and
   how they adapted to these challenges. Furthermore, we seek to understand
   what explains observed variation in the degree of challenges and needed
   adaptation measures. The observed challenges include increased and
   sometimes politicized caseload, limited expertise in medical field and
   conflicting or underdefined mandates among the institutions. The
   challenges and adaptation were conditioned by institutional traditions
   and ad-hoc arrangements in crisis management. In Finland and Sweden, the
   legal overseers became prominent sites for legal and public
   accountabilities of crisis governance and experienced more acute
   organizational challenges from increased and politicized caseloads as
   actors were seeking alternative accountability forums when participation
   and openness were severed. In Norway and Denmark, where other
   institutions were prominent in overseeing crisis governance and its
   legality, the legal overseers had a more pressing need to adapt for an
   evolving organizational landscape with new ad-hoc arrangements to
   oversee crisis management. Contributing to institutional approach on
   accountability and ombudsman research, we find a dynamic relationship
   between the government openness and legal oversight where the
   constraints for openness in crisis governance led to various challenges
   for the legal overseers' accountability capacities but to which they
   adapted by promoting openness as a right as well as an enabling
   mechanism for other accountability institutions.},

Abstract = {The Labour manifesto in this year's election implied a radical
   restructuring of the UK state, the way in which England is governed and
   in relations across the United Kingdom. The aim of making English
   devolution the `default option' is set against fifty years of
   unsuccessful and partial devolution initiatives which have failed to
   reverse the accretion of power in the central UK state. Centralisation
   can be seen as the consequence of an Anglocentric constitutionalism
   which vests power in the centre, underpins England's fragmented
   departmental governance and where accountability mechanisms flow to HM
   Treasury. Labour's success will reflect its willingness to challenge
   these constitutional assumptions, which are deeply embedded in the
   culture, practice and structures of Westminster and Whitehall.
   Successful devolution will require breaking the chains of accountability
   that tie local spending decisions to the centre and placing devolved
   English local government on a stronger constitutional basis.},

Abstract = {Considering that Shakespeare can be read from a philosophical
   perspective and recognizing the potential of literature to unravel
   concepts, break down academic barriers and broaden analytical horizons,
   this text proposes a reading of three fragments of William
   Shakespeare<acute accent>s narrative poem The Rape of Lucrece. After
   briefly reviewing the locations, ways and receptions in which Lucrece
   speaks, the poem is theoretical-politically examined through a critical
   articulation with DisAgreement (Ranci \& egrave;re, 2007). The way we
   interpret these authors aims to contribute to theoretical, conceptual
   and political reflections on our present. Thus, we wonder about the
   possibilities of political action in a capitalist, modern and neoliberal
   world that often leaves us without the tools to transform it.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {46},
Number = {4},
Pages = {610-621},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article is a theoretical contribution to the understanding of
   direct democracy (DD) and its properties. It departs from common
   definitions of DD by distinguishing between a hard meaning, according to
   which direct democracies are characterized by the fact that legislative
   initiative and veto rights are extended to the entire citizenry, and a
   soft meaning, according to which they are not. Building on previous
   findings, it argues that hard DD profoundly alters the balance of power
   in representative systems and reinforces the liberal features of
   democratic systems, such as the independence of checks and balances and
   the empowerment of minorities. This analysis invites us to understand
   direct democracies as systems in which representatives of political
   groups and independent institutions negotiate to find a consensual way
   to implement legislation, and a direct vote of the people only takes
   place if agreement is not reached.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 31},
Abstract = {Regularization can improve statistical estimates made with highly
   correlated data. However, any regularization procedure embeds
   assumptions about the data generating process that can have
   counterintuitive consequences when those assumptions are untenable. We
   show that rather than simply shrinking estimates, regularization can
   reopen backdoor causal paths, inflating the estimates of some effects,
   and in the wrong circumstances, even reversing their direction.
   Recently, Cavari and Freedman (2023), argued that declining cooperation
   rates in surveys have inflated measures of mass polarization. We show
   that this finding is driven by large penalty terms in their regularized
   regressions, which leads to the estimates being confounded with time.
   Alternative methods do not show a clear positive or negative effect of
   declining cooperation on estimated levels of mass polarization.},

Journal = {STATE POLITICS \& POLICY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The increasing nationalization of state and local politics alongside
   polarization and gridlock at the federal level have led states to become
   sites where policymaking on national hot button issues occurs. This
   political climate calls for a reconsideration of existing accounts of
   state identities, which posit that state identities are generally weak
   and apolitical in their content. This study considers the following
   questions: To what extent do respondents identify with their state? How
   does their state identity compare with other politically salient groups,
   like national identity, partisanship, race, and gender? To what extent
   and under what conditions are political considerations associated with
   state identities? How do results compare across different measures of
   state identification? Results show that a majority of respondents say
   that being from their state is an important part of their identity and
   the proportion saying so is similar to the proportion saying their race,
   class, and political party are important. Although politics may not come
   to mind first when respondents consider why their state is important, it
   relates to general feelings of connectedness, particularly for people in
   the political majority in their state, and being in the political
   majority is associated with increased levels of state identification.
   Results are similar across different measures of state identity. Closed-
   and open-ended questions show politics emerges most clearly when people
   explain why their state is not important to their identity. I discuss
   the implications of these findings and offer thoughts for future
   research.},

Abstract = {Statutory minimum wages have become an important tool for regulating
   labor markets. One major reason is the decline in collective wage
   bargaining. But how can minimum wages be justified? We show that their
   best justification does not lie in their economic effects but in the
   respect for social contributors that they express. The article takes an
   innovative interdisciplinary approach, bridging political philosophy and
   comparative political economy. We first discuss existing justifications
   in political practice and theory. We then show how a distinctive and
   robust justification should regard minimum wages as paying necessary
   respect to those who fulfill their obligation to contribute to social
   cooperation. Our justification thus suggests a new concept of economic
   citizenship and advances recognition theory applied to work. We outline
   further implications of the argument, such as the desirability of
   setting minimum wages through collective bargaining, and a tentative
   case for a maximum income.},

Abstract = {Legacies of an authoritarian past have enduring effects on voters'
   attitudes and behaviors. I argue that authoritarian nostalgia is an
   important source of group sentiment and voter behavior in
   post-authoritarian democracies. Voters with nostalgic sentiment
   construct strong group sentiment based on historical perception and
   express attachment towards authoritarian successors. I test this
   argument with a new measure of authoritarian nostalgia. With original
   data collected from South Korea and Taiwan, I provide evidence that
   nostalgic voters are likely to exhibit strong group sentiment observable
   through partisan attachment. Abstracting from the specific cases, I use
   a randomly assigned candidate comparison analysis to demonstrate that
   voters high in authoritarian nostalgia are more attracted to
   hypothetical candidates invoking nostalgia than those with high
   programmatic or ideological proximity. Overall, the results show how
   authoritarian nostalgia remains important as a source of group sentiment
   in maturing democracies.},

Abstract = {The coloniality of power stands as a major framework for theorizing race
   within the context of Latin America, providing an influential account of
   the origin of race in the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Without
   abandoning the task of theorizing the ways in which race functions in
   Latin America, this article asks: what is obscured by an insistence on
   1492 as the moment when race emerged, and what different understandings
   of race can be made available by connecting the colonization of the
   Americas to a different set of temporal and spatial referents?
   Specifically, I develop a ``prismatic{''} approach to analyze the impact
   of fifteenth-century Iberian blood purity statutes on the development of
   race without positing these as the new, singular origin of race. This
   article thus suggests an alternative genealogy of racialization while
   providing a critical engagement with the coloniality of power's account
   of race.},

Abstract = {Disseminating data is a core mission of international organizations. The
   Bretton Woods Institutions (BWIs), in particular, have become a main
   data source for research and policy-making. Due to their extensive
   lending activities, the BWIs often find themselves in a position to
   assist and pressure governments to increase the amount of economic data
   that they provide. In this study, we explore the association between
   loans from the BWIs and an index of economic transparency derived from
   the data-reporting practices of governments to the World Bank. Using a
   matching method for causal inference with panel data complemented by a
   multilevel regression analysis, we examine, separately, loan commitments
   and disbursements from the IMF and the World Bank. The multilevel
   regression analysis finds a significant association between BWI loans
   and the improvement of economic transparency in all developing
   countries; the matching method identifies a causal effect in
   democracies.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 24},
Abstract = {Transnational regulatory harmonisation is a key building block of the
   international legal order. However, little is known about how elite and
   citizen views of it differ. Using data from a Norwegian survey from 2023
   this article finds both citizen-elite and intra-elite gaps in
   perceptions of legal harmonisation. First, citizens are significantly
   less likely to support legal harmonisation than bureaucrats. In
   contrast, the article finds that their views of it are similar to those
   of all but the most Eurosceptic politicians. Furthermore, while the
   attitudes of bureaucrats only differ significantly from those of
   strongly Eurosceptic politicians, bureaucrats with a ministry or legal
   background hold views of legal harmonisation significantly different
   from those of other civil servants. Future studies of public and elite
   opinion of international cooperation must thus theorise more clearly how
   the elite-citizen gap may vary for different elites, and empirically
   test how these differences manifest across policy areas.},

Abstract = {I investigate why some countries were more successful in containing the
   death toll than others during the COVID-19 pandemic. I focus on the role
   of socialism and on the existence of long-term regime-driven legacies
   that may have had an impact on the containment of COVID-related deaths.
   I claim that countries that went through successful socialist
   revolutions have specific features that equip them with better resources
   to cope with public challenges such as pandemics. Furthermore, these
   features remain even after the demise of the socialist regime. I find a
   positive effect of socialist revolutions over COVID-19 containment at
   the country level. I investigate three possible causal mechanisms for
   this relationship: authoritarianism, state capacity, and mass
   mobilization. Through mediation analysis, I find the socialist legacy
   seems to be channeled through higher levels of mobilization and also
   more authoritarian institutions.},

Abstract = {Do the career motives of presidential appointees affect program
   administration? To answer this question, I examine the phased
   development of policy communication of the U.S. Farm Service Agency
   (FSA) across states from 2002 to 2018 based on an original collection of
   historical official websites. This is a rare policy context for
   examining why peer appointees administer the same programs differently.
   Linking the state-by-state development of FSA newsletters to the career
   trajectories of state executive directors (SEDs), the presidential
   appointees who lead state FSAs, I show that SEDs interested in elective
   office post-appointment are associated with faster institutionalization
   of newsletters. Examining these newsletters' content, I then show that
   SEDs interested in elective office or a career in advocacy include more
   participation-encouraging language in newsletters. These results suggest
   that appointees' career goals outside the bureaucracy can potentially
   expedite innovation in program implementation and enhance the delivery
   of government benefits to the public, with implications for selecting
   appointees to enhance bureaucratic performance.},

Abstract = {This model generates projections of the national popular vote and
   Electoral College votes a year in advance of the U.S. Presidential
   Election, before each party's nominees are known. It forecasts the
   Democratic two-party popular vote in each state and the District of
   Columbia. It uses four independent variables: national head-to-head
   polling data 13 months prior to the election, the states' prior election
   result, a party-adjusted home state advantage dummy variable, and a
   party adjusted variable simply counting the number of consecutive terms
   the current incumbent party has occupied the White House. New to this
   year's model is a polling average approach that encompasses all possible
   candidate matchups for whom data is available. This year's forecast
   suggests a distinct possibility of an Electoral College misfire
   benefitting the Republicans.},

Abstract = {Statesman and scholar Alexis de Tocqueville (1876) once noted, ``History
   is a gallery of pictures in which there are few originals and many
   copies.{''} In other words, history has a habit of repeating itself, and
   we can deduce cycles and patterns that likely will recur. Such stability
   and inertia should bode well for prediction. Nevertheless, when it comes
   to election forecasting, especially in the United States, most
   prognostications rely on short-term political fundamentals measuring
   macroeconomic performance or government or leader popularity. In this
   contribution, we adopt a structural approach but depart from existing
   literature by focusing on historical party and governance dynamics in
   the vein of de Tocqueville to establish whether they offer solid
   guidance regarding the performance of Democrats in US congressional
   elections. Our ex-post political history models provide solid
   predictions of which party will control Congress and the Democrats' seat
   tally in each chamber between 1946 and 2022. This creates conditions to
   assume that political history may help us forecast Campaign 2024. Our
   study applied this political history model to predict the 2024
   congressional elections. It forecast Democrats to lose control of the
   Senate with a net loss of three seats and estimated an exceptionally
   close race for House control, with the point estimate for the House
   suggesting that the Democrats would fall short of winning control.},

Title = {How do gender stereotypes about leadership positions change in the face
   of a crisis?},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study explores how a crisis situation affects voter bias towards
   women leaders. In an era of global pandemics, frequent climate
   disasters, economic recessions, and violent conflicts, this question is
   especially timely. Using an experimental research design, fielded prior
   the 2019 Israeli elections, we simulate a crisis in one of three policy
   areas. One typically regarded as masculine (defense), another as
   feminine (education), and a third with mixed perceptions (finance). We
   examine whether the framing of a crisis in one of these policy areas
   changes voters' gender stereotypes regarding the suitability of women or
   men for the relevant ministerial positions. We then interact the crisis
   condition with voters' gender baseline preference to see how their
   predispositions towards men and women in politics moderate the effect of
   a crisis on gender stereotypes. We find that while men are generally
   regarded as better suited to serve as Ministers of Defense and women to
   serve as Ministers of Education, a crisis situation increases the
   perceived suitability of men for both ministerial roles. Thus, a crisis
   situation strengthens the conventional notion of men as the most
   competent leaders. These effects are more pronounced among voters whose
   gender baseline preferences align with existing gender stereotypes.},

Abstract = {Listening is essential to student learning. But how can instructors
   build practices of listening into their courses? This article makes the
   case for adopting a listening-centered approach to university
   instruction to subvert the dominant ``transmission model{''} of
   education. It also provides an example of how such an approach can be
   implemented in practice. Specifically, I present the ``plague
   narrative,{''} a reflective writing assignment modeled after Thucydides'
   account of the plague of Athens in 430 BCE. The plague narrative gives
   instructors the opportunity to listen to students' experiences and to
   learn about their needs and situations. The exercise also offers
   students a relatively ``low stakes{''} opportunity to engage in
   political theorizing and critique. Instructors, if properly focused on
   listening, can use this assignment to better understand their students
   while helping them make sense of contemporary political life. I conclude
   by considering how this assignment can disrupt the forces that might
   push a student to rely on generative AI tools and instead encourage them
   to use their own critical thinking and writing skills.},

Abstract = {Where do leaders of smaller powers travel abroad? By examining
   high-level leader visits of a small power, we gain an understanding of
   the determinants of their foreign policy orientations. Existing
   literature on this topic is primarily qualitative. This study focuses on
   Jordan, using a comprehensive dataset of high-level visits from 1989 to
   2023 to test and revise assumptions about small power foreign policy. We
   find that Jordan's foreign policy priorities include ensuring national
   survival amid regional volatility, maintaining regime security in a
   country with a majority refugee population, securing economic aid to
   bolster fiscal stability, and demonstrating solidarity with Muslim
   countries. These findings highlight the importance of security and
   economic needs, as well as cultural and regional affiliations, in
   shaping Jordan's foreign relations.},

Abstract = {Analysis of journalistic fields is dominated by approaches that take
   news media at the nation-state level as the major unit of analysis. More
   recently, sociologists have asked whether we can speak of global
   journalistic fields. Many scholars have concluded that global
   journalistic fields are weak at best, and news production remains
   bounded by nation-states. This paper offers a more fine-tuned
   understanding of the boundaries of journalistic fields. Drawing on an
   interview-based qualitative study of regional journalistic fields in
   contemporary Crimea (a region of Ukraine annexed by Russia in 2014) and
   in Tatarstan (a region of Russia), I answer the questions ``how do
   states shape the autonomy of regional journalistic fields?{''} and ``how
   do journalists navigate the limitations they face?{''} I advance two
   arguments: first, journalistic fields can be understood as multiscalar
   fields, and the practices of journalists are shaped by the configuration
   of political relations along different scales simultaneously (the scale
   of the city, the region, the national scale, the scale of other
   nation-states, and the international arena). Second, the scales that
   exert the most influence on journalistic fields can change depending on
   whether the nation-state or the region is embroiled in conflict.},

Abstract = {British parties - and their candidates - frequently engage in the use of
   negative messaging. While previous studies shed light on the frequency
   and source of such messages, we know less about how negative messages
   are received. In this research note, we present the results of a pilot
   survey designed investigate perceptions of the different types of
   messages that political elites use to discuss their opponents. Our
   preliminary results suggest that there is significant variation in the
   perceived negativity of messages, with messages referencing specific
   individuals being more likely to be perceived to be negative.},

Abstract = {This study contributes to understanding mainstream parties' room for
   maneuver in the immigration domain by exploring the impact of
   moralization as a rhetorical strategy. Research has found anti-immigrant
   messages to be more effective than pro-immigrant messages in shaping
   public opinion. However, a pre-registered survey experiment with Danish
   respondents reveals that moral rhetoric enhances policy support for
   pro-immigrant communication, rendering it as effective as anti-immigrant
   messages. Partisan-motivated reasoning influences reactions to all
   messages except the non-moral anti-immigrant message, suggesting that
   when appealing to out-party supporters, mainstream parties still meet
   least resistance with an exclusive platform.},

Abstract = {Does the implementation of a ranked choice voting (RCV) system increase
   the number, diversity, and quality of candidates competing in local
   elections? Using original data from 273 cities across three decades and
   employing a preregistered difference-in-differences design with
   matching, I find that the size of the candidate pool increases following
   implementation. However, this effect dissipates in later election
   cycles, indicating that RCV has no long-term effect on candidate entry.
   Indeed, the short-term increase in the candidate pool mostly reflects
   increased entry by low-quality candidates with little chance of winning.
   Additionally, I find that RCV has no effect on the proportion of female
   and non-white candidates running for office. These results call into
   question several purported benefits of RCV and suggest that RCV, by
   itself, might not be sufficient to influence candidate entry at the
   local level.},

Abstract = {Although a burgeoning literature explores the international dimensions
   of populism, we still know little about how populist leaders gain
   international popularity. This paper describes how Viktor Orb \&
   aacute;n, the Prime Minister of Hungary, has emerged as the role model
   of international right-wing populism. It demonstrates that Orb \&
   aacute;n actively supplied himself as an example that like-minded
   politicians should follow. We draw on the concept of legitimation
   strategies to illustrate why Orb \& aacute;n markets himself as the
   leader of an international movement against liberal ideologues (Wajner,
   2022). At the same time, populists in many countries have searched
   abroad for a successful model to follow. Orb \& aacute;n's
   anti-migration policies and his defense of conservative family values
   constitute chapters of an illiberal playbook that right-wing populists
   are eager to implement. We use the concept of authoritarian learning to
   develop this demand-side perspective (Hall and Ambrosio, 2017).
   Empirically, we demonstrate our argument through an analysis of speeches
   delivered at a leading gathering of right-wing populists and moral
   conservatives: the Hungarian editions of the Conservative Political
   Action Conference (CPAC) that took place in Budapest in 2022 and 2023.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to shed light on Berlusconi's political
   strategy to reshape the state by examining some of the incentives for
   discretionary changes in the tax-benefit system during his
   administrations. We argue that by exploiting the typically categorical
   and fragmented nature of the Italian welfare system, Berlusconi's
   governments engaged in the `art of manipulation' within the tax-benefit
   framework, reflecting his efforts in social engineering to forge new
   electoral alliances. It is well established that redistributive
   programmes are the outcome of intense political decision-making, as they
   create redistributive advantages among different social groups. This
   article contends that, under the guise of economic liberalism, the
   Berlusconi governments devised redistributive strategies aimed at
   constructing new social constituencies to bolster and legitimize his
   dominant position. Although his governments promised a pact of `From
   Decline to Growth' for all through tax-benefit redistribution, they
   ultimately introduced only incremental changes rather than long-term
   structural reforms. In conclusion, Berlusconi's neoliberal `revolution'
   was more rhetoric than reality.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the short-lived reform experiment on grassroot
   democracy by the District Councils of Hong Kong in 2020-2021, following
   the landslide victory of candidates who supported the 2019
   Anti-Extradition Movement of Hong Kong. It argues that the institutional
   positions and resources of local elections can serve as movement
   resources to support social and political movements, promote civic
   participation and community-building, and strengthen civil society. By a
   study of meeting documents and in-depth interviews with 50 pro-movement
   councillors, this paper recounted how movement activists made use of the
   local councils to support the movement, change funding allocation to
   counter clientelism, encourage grassroot participation and network with
   civil society. The window of political opportunity was quickly shut down
   with the imposition of the National Security Law for Hong Kong, but it
   showed the possibility of using local councils to further movement
   causes and grassroot democracy in a much-constrained non-democratic
   institutional setting.},

Title = {Historicizing the Historical Turn in Human Rights Studies Origins,
   Inequality, and Neoliberalism in the Modern Epoch},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {322-339},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {The historical turn in human rights studies is characterized by a deep
   cleavage between scholars who locate the origins of human rights in the
   Atlantic Revolutions of the late 18th century, and scholars who instead
   focus on the post-WWII period in general, and on the 1970s in particular
   as a breakthrough decade for international human rights. Against the
   background of what has been described as the threatened status of human
   rights today, we contend that the problem of origins remains as crucial
   as ever before, but that the way in which it is conceived is outdated
   and in need of reconceptualization in three ways. First, the historical
   turn should be seen as one body of literature with two distinct phases:
   one focused on origins and historical continuity and rupture, and a more
   recent, ongoing phase addressing the relationship between human rights
   and the concomitant neoliberalization of society and increasing economic
   inequality. We contend, secondly, that the debate itself needs to be
   historicized, and that the two thematic phases are rooted in two
   specific political, ideological, and economic contexts. The debate about
   origins relate to a pre-2007-2008 financial crisis era, marked by
   near-universal acceptance of human rights. Meanwhile, the issues of
   inequality and neoliberalism predominantly emerged in the post-crisis
   period as human rights faced more and more challenges. Thirdly, we
   present a theoretical argument for why the distinct issues constituting
   the two thematic phases should not be separated from each other. Indeed,
   in this setting, we demonstrate that the question regarding the relation
   between neoliberalism and human rights presupposes an account of the
   origins of human rights.},

Abstract = {The essay aims at discussing the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by
   parliaments, by distinguishing among four hypothetical uses: to assist
   in drafting legislation; to create secondary legislation; to crowdsource
   legislation; to replace parliaments by virtual politicians. It will be
   argued that while some of these uses do not raise concerns, three
   promises underlying algorithm democracy cannot be integrated within the
   framework of liberal democracy. These promises are: that popular will
   may emerge from data mining; that AI democracy may give rise to a truly
   successful technocracy untainted by human errors; and that the
   opposition between democracy and technocracy may be overcome. These
   promises have been characterized as illusions.},

Abstract = {Brandi ng in international relations is no longer an added value, but a
   necessity. Countries that are trying to become globally recognizable and
   that are constantly developing their brand understand this very well.
   There is no single answer to the question of how strong a country is as
   a brand. That's why tourists, consumers, the media and the public in
   general take different indexes of brand countries as relevant
   indicators. Regardless of the difference in their methodology, the
   best-known global indexes, included in this work, point to the
   importance of managing countries as brands and the influence of image on
   economic, political and other successes in the international market,
   which ultimately speaks to the importance of high positions on the
   indexes that enable the countries' global media promotion. The aim of
   this paper is to present and clarify the methodology of the global index
   of brand countries, but with a special emphasis on Croatia as a brand.
   The authors analyze how the methodologies were set in each of the
   mentioned indexes, but also how the position of Croatia as a brand has
   changed in the last 10 years. In addition to the current position of
   Croatia according to the analyzed indexes, special emphasis will be
   placed on the areas in which Croatia can be considered a competitive and
   desirable country brand. For the purpose of this paper, the authors set
   two research questions, trying to find an answer which countries appear
   most often among the top ten countries in analyzed indexes. Also, by
   setting the second research question, the authors try to define how
   strong Croatia is as a brand according to the analyzed indexes and in
   which areas.},

   self-determination of rights and punitive power},
Journal = {URVIO-REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE ESTUDIOS DE SEGURIDAD},
Year = {2024},
Number = {40},
Month = {SEP-DEC},
Abstract = {Introduction: The problem of energy security has already been addressed
   from a multidimensional approach, but always associated with a
   geopolitical, national security or sovereignty issue. Internal security
   during neoliberalism represents a process of inflation of the penal
   system. Thus, energy security, even from a multidimensional approach, is
   blurred if an approach that criminalizes those who self-manage access to
   the rights to adequate life and housing, to energy and to the city
   predominates. Objective: The main objective of this article is to
   propose a new way of understanding the problem of energy security,
   taking it from a watertight concept to a pendulum between
   ``security/insecurity{''} that serves to weigh the degree of enjoyment
   of these rights. Methodology: For this purpose, housing fires between
   2018 and 2023 in a city of 640 thousand inhabitants (Salta, Argentina)
   were collected, analyzed and systematized, and this information was
   crossed with data from the National Registry of Popular Neighborhoods
   and the Municipality of Salta. Conclusions: This allowed concluding that
   reappropriating ``energy security{''} as a shield to guarantee access to
   rights is a fertile ground not only for academic purposes, but also for
   legal, social and political ones.},

Abstract = {In states and localities with direct democracy, citizens can advance
   their policy interests without the aid of elected officials. Research
   documenting citizens' lack of political knowledge raises questions about
   their ability to do so. We conduct three studies during real-world
   direct democracy elections to determine whether citizens choose
   alternatives (the ballot proposal or status quo) that are closest to
   their ideological positions and whether political information improves
   this outcome. Using original surveys, our first two studies estimate
   citizens' ideological positions and show that citizens regularly choose
   alternatives that are closest to these positions. Using a survey
   experiment, our third study indicates that political information (party
   cues, policy information, and spatial maps) further improves such
   spatial voting. These results demonstrate citizens' capacity to advance
   their policy interests in direct democracy elections and identify
   conditions under which political information strengthens the
   relationship between citizens' policy interests and choices about ballot
   propositions.},

Abstract = {Relations between Russian private military companies (PMCs) and organs
   of the Russian foreign policy and security apparatus make the headlines
   almost daily, oscillating between cooperation, competition, infighting,
   and mutiny. This behavior makes relying on PMCs puzzling and seemingly
   irrational. Hence, this article explores why Russia has enlisted and
   ultimately de-enlisted Wagner PMC during its full-scale invasion of
   Ukraine. The first section reviews previous explanations for using PMCs
   developed in the contexts of liberal democracies and assesses their
   transferability to an autocratic context. Based on these explanations,
   the article builds a synthetic theoretical framework by combining
   ideational, political-instrumentalist, and functionalist explanations in
   a domain-of-application approach. The empirical section is based on the
   qualitative analysis of the daily Russian Offensive Campaign Assessments
   published by the Institute for the Study of War. The article finds that
   while ideational explanations highlight the broader trend to privatize
   security through PMCs and the ways that certain historical narratives
   legitimized the Kremlin's insertion of PMC Wagner into Russian foreign
   policy in the first place, the political-instrumentalist and
   functionalist explanations help understand the cooperation-conflict
   dynamism during the Ukraine war. The findings contribute to a better
   understanding of autocratic security privatization and the increasing
   role of non-Western PMCs as domestic, regional, and global political
   actors.},

Abstract = {Originating from the need for the recognition of social justice for
   communities living in remote areas and in conditions characterised by
   unequal power relationships, fear and exclusion. This article addresses
   the question `How can the complementarity of the criminal justice system
   of South Africa in partnership with communities, with specific reference
   to the San communities of the Northern Cape Province of South Africa,
   achieve social justice?'. The authors argue that social justice for
   communities such as the San communities of South Africa, could be
   achieved by means of a triangulation that involves mutual respect for
   the dignity of the person; applying the principles of human rights to
   all people; and the complementarity of dispute resolution processes
   which are acknowledged by the communities. After offering a theoretical
   and philosophical framework, the specific case study of the San is
   discussed to elucidate how the criminal justice system in partnership
   with communities, can achieve complementarity of justice systems towards
   social justice in society at large. This complementarity is relevant in
   highlighting access to justice and the implementation of dispute
   resolution processes that accounts for the rights, human dignity,
   culture and integrity of the participants.},

Abstract = {How does the institutional context shape how much party position change
   on LGBTQ+ rights is attributable to conversion (i.e., incumbents
   changing their positions) versus replacement (i.e., legislative
   turnover)? Research on party position change on LGBTQ+ rights has
   focused on the US, meaning findings may be limited to a particular
   institutional context. Turning to the Canadian case, I find that party
   position change on LGBTQ+ rights was larger in magnitude and happened
   faster in Canada than in the US. I argue that institutional differences
   created opportunities for more considerable and rapid conversion and
   replacement in Canada compared to the US. Institutional opportunities
   for conversion and replacement can vary by country, by party, and over
   time. As work on conversion, replacement, and party position change
   expands further beyond the US, it will be important to consider how the
   institutional context shapes opportunities for - and the dynamics of -
   party position change.},

Abstract = {Although commentators often point to the political value of legislators'
   geographic ties, less is known about the influence of such connections
   once in office. Given recent scholarship underscoring the importance of
   geography as a dimension of identity, we argue that local legislators
   should behave as descriptive representatives. We collect the hometowns
   of all members of Congress with known birth locations from 1789 to 2020
   to analyze how being born near one's district impacts legislator
   behavior. We connect these data to information on a series of behaviors,
   finding that local legislators emphasize constituency work over
   policymaking and party-building. Moreover, while local legislators do
   not demonstrate substantively less partisan unity in roll-call voting,
   they attract a higher percentage of out-party cosponsors to their bills.
   Together, our results point to important representational implications
   regarding the geographic roots of legislators and the role of local
   connections in the contemporary Congress.},

Abstract = {There are increasing concerns about affective polarization between
   political groups in the US and elsewhere. While most work explaining
   affective polarization focuses on a combination of social and
   ideological sorting, we ask whether people's personalities are
   associated with friendliness to their political in-group and hostility
   to their political out-group. We argue that the personality trait of
   narcissism (entitled self-importance) is an important correlate of
   affective polarization. We test this claim in Britain using nationally
   representative survey data, examining both long-standing party
   identities and new Brexit identities. Our findings reveal that
   narcissism, and particularly the `rivalry' aspect of narcissism, is
   associated with both positive and negative partisanship. This
   potentially not only explains why some people are more susceptible to
   affective polarization, but also has implications for elite polarization
   given that narcissism is an important predictor of elite entry.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we address the issue of partisan bias in compulsory
   voting systems. Given the current global trends - declining trust in
   mainstream political parties, rising support for left- and right-wing
   radicals, growing populism and anti-elite sentiment - we seek to
   determine how they manifest themselves in an environment where citizens
   are required to vote by law. To answer this question, a
   quasi-experimental design is proposed. The data show that forced
   activity does not affect either extreme forces support rates (from a
   cross-country perspective) or the rationality of their voters (from an
   individual-level perspective). As far as we know, this is the first
   attempt to generalize the role of compulsory voting in extreme politics,
   as well as the first one to refute this role with ample evidence.
   En este art \& iacute;culo, abordamos el problema del sesgo de partido
   en los sistemas de votaci \& oacute;n obligatoria. Dadas las tendencias
   mundiales actuales (la disminuci \& oacute;n de la confianza en los
   partidos pol \& iacute;ticos convencionales, el aumento del apoyo a los
   radicales de izquierda y derecha, el aumento del populismo y el
   sentimiento anti-elitista), nuestro objetivo es determinar c \&
   oacute;mo se manifiestan en un entorno en el que los ciudadanos deben
   votar por ley. Para responder a esta pregunta, ofrecemos un dise \&
   ntilde;o cuasi experimental. Los datos muestran que la actividad
   coercitiva no afecta el nivel de apoyo de las fuerzas extremas (desde
   una perspectiva multinacional) ni la racionalidad de sus votantes (desde
   una perspectiva individual). Por lo que sabemos, este es el primer
   intento de generalizar el papel del voto obligatorio en la pol \&
   iacute;tica extrema, as \& iacute; como el primer intento de refutar
   este papel con suficiente evidencia.},

Abstract = {Efficient and modern archive management is very important in this
   digital era, especially at the local government level. In this context,
   this study explores the urgency of archive management using the
   Integrated Dynamic Archival Information System (SRIKANDI) approach in
   the Pekanbaru City Government. The research method used is qualitative,
   with data sources from interviews, documentation, and observation and
   analysis using the NVivo 12 Plus software. The study's results
   identified challenges to SRIKANDI implementation, including inadequate
   technological infrastructure, the need for skilled human resources in
   information technology, attention to data security, changes in
   organizational culture, and ongoing technical support. Based on these
   findings, policy recommendations have been made, including investments
   in technology infrastructure, human resource training and development,
   strict data protection, and changes in organizational culture. This
   research has positive implications for archive management, increasing
   efficiency and accountability in Pekanbaru. This research provides
   insights for other city governments wishing to undertake similar digital
   transformations in electronic-based archives management},

Abstract = {The aims of this article is to see the Indonesian media framing toward
   Habib Rizieq after returning to Indonesia, from Saudi Arabia in 2020.
   Habib Rizieq Shihab has become one of the media's figures since
   returning from Saudi Arabia in November 2020. Habib Rizieq is one of the
   foremost religious figures who has fought or delegitimized Joko Widodo's
   leadership since 2014. Habib Rizieq has fought for the enforcement of
   Islamic law in Indonesia and against Jokowi's regime, which he sees as
   less pro-Islam. The theory used in this article is framing theory.This
   article analyzes the mainstream media's framing in Indonesia, namely
   Kompas, Tempo, Jakarta Post, and Republika, in reporting on Habib Rizieq
   Shihab's figure. In this study, we processed data using the Nvivo 12 and
   VOSviewer application tools to see media sentiment. In this research, we
   read 317 news from the four mainstream medias in Indonesia from October
   to December 2020. We use four keywords in the framing analysis:
   positive, negative, moderately positive, and moderately negative. This
   study indicates that moderately negative framing is the highest in
   Indonesia's mainstream media coverage on Habib Rizieq Shihab's figure.
   It means that Habib Rizieq failed to reconstruct the power of the masses
   against Joko Widodo's regime.},

Title = {Business and human rights as Swedish foreign policy: The soft

Abstract = {This article aims to explain why national governments choose soft
   policies in the domestication of international norms even when those
   norms may explicitly call for harder measures. The article achieves this
   aim by exploring domestic adoption of National Action Plans (NAPs) for
   implementing the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human
   Rights (UNGPs). The UNGPs are an international soft law instrument that
   calls for a mix of voluntary and mandatory policies to promote human
   rights due diligence, and NAPs are soft domestic policy instruments that
   lack the bindingness of mandatory due diligence legislation now found in
   several states. Most governments with NAPs have adopted them
   specifically as foreign policies, treating them not as regulatory
   initiatives but as tools for enhancing national reputations. Using a
   range of primary and secondary sources, the article constructs a case
   study of Sweden to explain why governments might opt for softer
   implementation of the UNGPs in the form of NAPs. It draws several
   conclusions: (1) governments may emulate the approach to domesticating
   international regulatory norms that is promoted by international
   organisations; (2) support from domestic actors motivates norm
   implementation, and the policy style selected is likely to reflect power
   constellations in the state and, under consensus-based governance
   systems, the lowest common denominator of actor preferences; and (3)
   path dependency following institutional venue selection influences the
   type of policy developed and adopted. These findings shed new light on
   the reasons why international policy norms are implemented in `softer'
   ways than perhaps intended by their architects.},

Abstract = {In May 2018, a record-breaking number of 86 women candidates ran for
   parliamentary elections in Lebanon, a country with a power-sharing,
   consociational, sect-based system that guarantees the representation of
   18 legally recognized sects (i.e. religious confessions). Yet, only six
   women were elected. This article explores whether and how sectarianism
   trumps gender and support for female candidates in general in vote
   intention. In doing so, it addresses the interaction between
   sectarian/ethnic and gender voting in contexts where both identities
   intersect. This intersection emerges when vote intention is influenced
   by factors that stem from the patriarchal nature of society and
   structures of sectarianism, creating interdependent systems of
   disadvantage. Building on a countrywide pre-electoral survey on the
   attitudes of young voters in Lebanon, I test ethnic voting and
   gender-affinity theories and develop fine-grained conceptual links
   between gender and the wider norms of inclusion and exclusion under
   sectarian-based political systems in post-conflict countries.},

Abstract = {It is increasingly common for politicians to experience online
   harassment. Even though numerous studies show the prevalence and impact
   of online abuse towards politicians, the broader societal impact of this
   phenomenon is understudied. This study focuses on the deterring effect
   that witnessing online abuse towards politicians could have on
   bystanders, testing to what extent online intimidation influences the
   appeal of political office. This pre-registered project examines whether
   exposure to abusive or sexist Twitter comments towards politicians
   weakens the interest of UK citizens, women especially, in pursuing
   political office. We hypothesized that seeing intimidating Twitter
   comments addressed to politicians leads to less political ambition in
   bystanders, especially if their gender identity aligns with that of the
   targeted politician. Sexist abusive comments were expected to have a
   greater impact on women participants than non-gendered abusive comments.
   The findings show that citizens are generally not easily deterred by
   exposure to abuse. However, we find differential effects that are
   concerning for political participation and female representation. There
   is evidence that sexist comments do discourage women observers.
   Respondents also generally espouse very negative expectations about the
   online experience of political aspirants.},

Abstract = {This article revisits aspects of the current debate that surrounds the
   annual stop and search statistics, which has become polarised and
   narrowly focussed on measurement. It aims to broaden the focus of the
   debate and encourage more comprehensive understandings of the multiple
   causes of disproportionality in support of more effective policy
   intervention. The evidence for disproportionality is presented and an
   argument made for the experience of stop and search, and its effects, to
   be considered alongside relative stop and search rates. Traditional and
   alternative methods of estimating disproportionality are discussed,
   concluding that census-based measures of the resident population remain
   the best denominator at the national level. The article closes by
   drawing out the explanations for disproportionality that are implied by
   the different estimation methods and proposing a social-ecological model
   that captures micro- and macro-level influences on racialised patterns
   of policing.},

Abstract = {The goal of this article is to present a cross-national study of gender
   equality mechanisms, Institutional Mechanisms as Critical Actors for
   Gender Equality: A Review from the OSCE
   Regionhttps://www.osce.org/odihr/556587, conducted for the Organization
   of Cooperation and Security of Europe and led by Amy G. Mazur in
   collaboration with Organization of Democratic Institutions and Human
   Rights in the OSCE. The review is based on a survey of national-level
   IMs in 42 out of 57 ``participating states{''} in the OSCE region and
   follow-up qualitative research including elite interviews and two site
   visits. The article discusses first the methodological approach and
   framework of the study and then turns findings presented in the 2023
   report in five areas. It ends with a presentation of the major policy
   recommendations and the research agenda for studying IMs on such a
   global level that came out of the project.},

Abstract = {Authoritarian regionalism constitutes a challenging topic for empirical
   research due to a substantial gap between official mandates and the
   actual practices of regional organizations (ROs). While formally most
   authoritarian ROs ``download{''} the global script of regionalism and
   imitate the European Union, in practice, they are used by their member
   states for different purposes than economic integration-in particular,
   to legitimize the nondemocratic regimes. At the same time, there are
   also examples of authoritarian ROs that go beyond simple
   autocracy-sustaining rhetoric and have actual policy implications. This
   paper argues that the differences between authoritarian ROs can be
   better observed if one looks not at the official mandates but at the
   background of their key officials. Using the case of post-Soviet Eurasia
   with its proliferation of authoritarian ROs, I show that a look at the
   biographies of officials clearly reveals the existence of two
   generations of ROs-one with primarily symbolic importance and one with
   actual economic integration ambitions.
   Der autorit \& auml;re Regionalismus bildet aufgrund einer besonders gro
   ss en Diskrepanz zwischen den Mandaten und den realexistierenden
   Praktiken der regionalen Organisationen eine Herausforderung f \& uuml;r
   die empirische Forschung. Formal folgen die meisten autorit \& auml;ren
   regionalen Organisationen dem globalen Skript des Regionalismus, indem
   sie die EU imitieren. Die realen Ziele der regionalen Organisationen k
   \& ouml;nnen aber von denen der wirtschaftlichen Integration massiv
   abweichen. Dies h \& auml;ngt unter anderem damit zusammen, dass sie
   sich eher auf die Legitimierung der nichtdemokratischen Regime
   konzentrieren. Es gibt jedoch Beispiele von autorit \& auml;ren
   regionalen Organisationen, die sich nicht nur auf eine reine rhetorische
   Unterst \& uuml;tzung der autorit \& auml;ren Systeme begrenzen, sondern
   auch reale Politikimplikationen verfolgen. Dieser Aufsatz zeigt, dass
   sich die Besonderheiten der autorit \& auml;ren Organisationen besser
   verstehen lassen, wenn man die Biografien der Beamt{*}innen und nicht
   (nur) die offiziellen Mandate dieser Organisationen in den Fokus nimmt.
   Das Beispiel des postsowjetischen Eurasiens offenbart mit seiner
   Vielzahl von autorit \& auml;ren regionalen Organisationen, dass in
   dieser Region zwei Generationen von regionalen Organisationen
   vorherrschen - zum einen diejenigen mit rein symbolischen Funktionen und
   zum anderen solche mit ernst gemeinten Ambitionen in Richtung der
   wirtschaftlichen Integration ihrer Mitglieder.},

Abstract = {Generation X often receives less attention in generational analysis due
   to its perceived lack of distinctiveness compared to preceding and
   succeeding generations in the contemporary United States. Politically,
   there is little justification for distinguishing Generation X as it is
   commonly defined, yet it harbors significant political divergence
   between its older and younger cohorts. In terms of partisanship,
   ideology, and public policy preferences, Generation X is markedly
   divided, essentially comprising two distinct political generations.
   Generation X can thus be viewed as the in-between generation
   representing the political dividing line between young and old. The
   dividing point is the birth year of 1973. Due to the considerable
   differences in the political climate during their formative years, those
   Gen Xers born before 1973 lean considerably more conservative and
   Republican than those born in 1973 and afterward.},

Title = {Socialism and non-domination: a relational egalitarian approach},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 10},
Abstract = {In recent literature on the philosophical foundations of socialism a
   growing number of theorists have endorsed the claim that freedom as
   non-domination is a fundamental normative commitment undergirding
   socialist politics. On this sort of view, a broad range of traditional
   socialist claims can be explained and justified by reference to freedom
   as non-domination. In this paper, I argue that even if these theorists
   are right that opposition to domination is a core socialist normative
   commitment, it is not clear that that opposition is best understood in
   terms of a commitment to a particular conception of freedom. Instead,
   socialist opposition to domination can be more fruitfully understood as
   flowing from a commitment to a relational conception of equality,
   according to which relationships with a substantially egalitarian
   character have a special value. I argue, first, that a relational
   egalitarian construal of socialist opposition to domination can retain
   all of the benefits of the freedom as non-domination construal, and,
   secondly, that a relational egalitarian account will have benefits that
   a freedom as non-domination approach will lack. I conclude that there
   are still significant benefits to retaining a place for equality in our
   considered account of the normative foundations of socialism.},

Abstract = {This article investigates and critiques the view that Lockean
   prerogative power is or should be incorporated, legally or extralegally,
   into the American constitutional system. Some scholars argue that
   extraconstitutional prerogative represents a safer alternative to a
   broad legal reading of presidential power, as it creates fewer
   precedents. Others suggest that the Framers ``constitutionalized
   prerogative.{''} Both of these views have difficulties because
   ultimately, prerogative can create more dangerous precedents than legal
   uses of presidential power.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the relationship between protest and the emergence
   of the extreme right in Brazil and Argentina. The cases of Jair
   Bolsonaro and Javier Milei provide comparative data for identifying
   similarities and differences around the protest demands and its
   relationship with the political regime. Based on the methodology of
   protest event analysis and on theories on the dynamics and mechanisms
   connecting protest, democratic crisis, and representation, we found
   important differences between the two countries as well as similar
   elements. While in Brazil there were processes of crisis and
   institutional rupture permeated by the rise of nationalist and new right
   groups that later turned to an extreme right, in Argentina there were
   elements of institutional continuity where the protest contributed to
   constructing the motos which the extreme right would later take up. On
   the other hand, among the similar elements we find that in both
   countries protest contributed to the reconstruction of certain political
   narratives, endorsing discourses that were not previously accepted in
   public discussion.},

Abstract = {Do negative economic shocks heighten public opposition to immigration,
   and through what mechanisms? Extant research suggests that economic
   circumstances and levels of labour market competition have little
   bearing on citizens' immigration attitudes. Yet personal economic shocks
   have the potential to trigger the threatened, anti-immigration responses
   - possibly through channels other than labour market competition - that
   prior cross-sectional research has been unable to detect. To examine
   these propositions, we used a unique panel study which tracked a large,
   population-based sample of Americans between 2007 and 2020. We found
   that adverse economic shocks, especially job losses, spurred opposition
   to unauthorized immigration. However, such effects are not concentrated
   among those most likely to face labour market competition from
   unauthorized immigrants. Instead, they are concentrated among white male
   Americans. This evidence suggests that the respondents' anti-immigration
   turn does not stem from economic concerns alone. Instead, personal
   experiences with the economy are refracted through salient
   socio-political lenses.},

Abstract = {Both democracy and empire are central to American political development.
   Yet, the role of Congress-that organ of democratic politics-in the
   expansion of US empire is not well understood. This article explains how
   and why Congress institutionalized representation from Washington, DC
   and the US territories in the mid-twentieth century. We uncover the
   history of a puzzling position: the Congressional delegate, who is
   permitted to debate, but not vote. Drawing on extensive original
   archival research and quantitative analysis of legislative voting
   behavior, this article explicates how racial attitudes structured
   conflict over the delegate position. We highlight the centrality of
   racial ideas to the institutionalization of American empire in the
   mid-twentieth century.},

Abstract = {Because of increasing political polarization in many democracies,
   politicians who try to make amends for past harms will often find that
   their reputation in the eyes of the other side is irredeemable. In such
   cases, publicly playing up rather than toning down those attributes that
   have made one an ``archvillain{''} will often be a more effective way of
   making amends-whether by mobilizing an opposing camp with which one now
   secretly sympathizes, by increasing the chances of moderate candidates
   to win crucial elections, or by increasing the chance that the dangerous
   camp to which one pretends to belong will self-destruct. I explore
   several possible explanations for why repentant political wrongdoers
   might have a moral duty to ``play the villain{''} to such ends. Drawing
   on the philosophy of punishment, and on the hypocrisy literature, I
   argue that the best explanation revolves around the inevitability of
   hypocrisy in democratic politics.},

Title = {Non-green ecological conservation: right-wing ecology in contemporary
   Germany},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 27},
Abstract = {After the rise and mainstreaming of the modern ecological movement, the
   right-wing ecological ideology has not gradually died out, and
   right-wing ecologists are still very active today. They not only
   actively participate in ecological debates and activities, but also
   combine their ideological concepts with practice, and focus on
   right-wing land grabbing in rural areas. As ecological issues tend to
   blur the boundaries between political camps, right-wing ecological
   conservation in `green' garb is extremely misleading and harmful, and
   therefore needs to be studied in depth. Firstly, this article analyses
   the ideological basis of right-wing ecology in contemporary Germany from
   three aspects: historical view, human view and worldview. Secondly, by
   analyzing the basic positions of right-wing ecologists in the three main
   fields of ecological conservation, namely species protection, animal
   protection, green genetic engineering and organic agriculture, and their
   specific modes of action, this article identifies the motives of the
   right-wing ecologists' participation in ecological conservation in terms
   of historical reasons and practical needs, and analyses the
   characteristics of their argumentation. Finally, on the basis of the
   above research, this article specifies the essential differences between
   right-wing ecological conservation and modern, civilized and scientific
   ecological conservation and its harms.},

Abstract = {Asia's contribution will be decisive for the global effort to mitigate
   climate change. But Asia lacks a country that could take the lead and
   inspire the rest of the region to accelerate its climate action. To
   identify countries that could fulfill such a role, this article takes a
   two-step, mixed-methods approach. First, an index is created to identify
   some potentially leading countries. Second, the top countries identified
   by the index are assessed in greater detail qualitatively. The analysis
   finds that China, Japan, and Singapore are the most plausible candidates
   to take the lead. By doing so, these countries could potentially inspire
   their neighbors to step up their own efforts as climate change becomes
   an increasingly important issue in international affairs. However, to
   become a leader and influence their peers, they will have to make a
   conscious choice and dedicated effort.},

Abstract = {What determines the content of bilateral diplomacy? I argue that the
   foreign policy issues prioritized by specific embassies are influenced
   by their diplomats' sources of information. For evidence, I study the
   proliferation of American Chambers of Commerce (AmChams)-private
   interest groups composed of US firms that are operating in specific host
   states-over the 20th and early 21st centuries. AmChams became key
   sources of information for US embassies, particularly on issues of
   relevance to the private sector (such as tax, trade, and investment
   regulations). Using novel text data from approximately 1500 oral history
   interviews with former diplomats, and leveraging the institutional
   structure of diplomatic rotation, I show that diplomats who were exposed
   to active AmCham branches paid significantly greater attention to
   commercial issues. These results identify a new avenue through which
   interest groups can influence foreign policy, help explain the
   proliferation of probusiness international agreements over the past
   several decades, and contribute to the growing literature on diplomacy
   in the international political economy.},

Abstract = {``Cross-aisle{''} interpersonal relationships on the Supreme Court
   receive significant attention from the justices and the media that
   covers them. When speaking to the public, justices frequently deflect
   questions about legal differences with each other by pointing to their
   ability to get along off the bench, suggesting everyone is just doing
   their job and there are no hard feelings when opinions go the other way.
   We theorize these tales of off-bench collegiality create a non-judicial
   avenue for public evaluation of the Court and its justices. But we also
   suspect that case outcomes limit these stories' influence. To test this
   theory, we conducted a survey experiment that exposed individuals to
   several stories about judicial friendships. We find that discussing
   friendships influences attitudes toward the Court most when such stories
   include a clear cue about the friendly justices' opposing ideologies.
   When accounting for ex ante policy preferences, however, that influence
   is entirely attenuated. Our results indicate these stories impact
   evaluations of the Court, but outcome-based evaluations prove more
   critical, suggesting the menu of options for the Court to bolster public
   support is limited in the context of case outcomes.},

Title = {The Personalization of Electoral Participation? The Relationship Between
   Trait Evaluations of Presidential Candidates and Turnout Decisions in
   American Presidential Elections 1980-2020},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Abstract = {The personalization thesis claims that leaders' influence over voters
   has increased. While research consistently shows that candidates
   influence party choice, we know little about their effects on the prior
   decision to turn out in elections. This article represents the first
   study to examine the relationship between candidate trait evaluations
   and turnout decisions in the American context and the first longitudinal
   study of the phenomenon. The study utilizes ANES data to test three
   hypotheses drawn from theories on electoral participation and
   personalized politics in U.S. presidential elections between 1980 and
   2020. The results show that while trait evaluations of Republican
   candidates consistently affect turnout, perceptions of Democratic
   candidates' competence mobilize voters in specific elections. Moreover,
   individual polarization promotes turnout, particularly among partisan
   dealigned voters with different perceptions of the candidates'
   competence. The results indicate a personalization of electoral
   participation that can benefit civic engagement and democratic quality.},

Abstract = {The person-positivity bias states that evaluations of real-life
   individuals are more positive compared to evaluations of collectivities
   or impersonal objects. This paper aims to test the prevalence of a
   person-positivity bias in a political context in two respects: (1) we
   examine whether voters develop stronger negative affective reactions
   towards other-minded collective actors (i.e. political parties) compared
   to individual actors (i.e. politicians), and (2) we investigate whether
   the provision of personalized individuating information tempers the
   development of negative feelings towards politicians. A survey
   experiment conducted among a representative sample of the Flemish
   population (N = 1200) reveals patterns of vertical affective
   polarization. However, our study did not find significant evidence that
   voters dislike other-minded collective actors more than other-minded
   individual politicians. Also the extent to which individual MPs are
   personalized has little effect on voters' affective evaluations. Taken
   together, this study highlights that ideological (dis)agreement is
   primarily steering voters' evaluation of political actors.},

Abstract = {The foreign policy objectives of nations typically stem from their
   perceptions of global dynamics, often shaped by specific National Role
   Conceptions (NRCs). This study considers these conceptions as
   articulated in the programmatic speeches of Italy's Prime Ministers and
   Foreign Affairs Ministers from 2016 to 2022, a period marked by the
   governance of five administrations, some supported by populist parties.
   The primary objective is to discern the NRCs underpinning Italy's
   foreign-policy objectives and strategies, aiming to identify significant
   departures from the approaches of previous governments. Additionally,
   the research aims to ascertain whether recent Italian foreign policy
   exhibits traits characteristic of populist agendas as discussed in the
   international relations literature. The key finding reveals notable
   consistency, reflecting internal coherence and continuity in Italy's
   foreign-policy framework. Populist narratives, it appears, remain
   largely confined to the domain of rhetoric, exerting minimal influence
   on actual foreign policy directives. However, this continuity also
   implies a limited capacity to adapt to the rapidly evolving global
   landscape, potentially undermining the efficacy of Italy's foreign
   policy in the future.},

Abstract = {The Global Justice Index is a multiyear research project based at Fudan
   Institute for Advanced Study in Social Sciences that assesses the
   contributions made by each country to achieving greater global justice.
   We have published results for yeas from 2010 to 2020 in Global Justice
   Index Report from 2019 to 2022, and are now presenting our fifth year of
   results, covering data from 2021 in Global Justice Index Report 2023,
   which is an updated version of previous years' reports. But, we have
   been improving our index year by year to with changes that have taken
   place globally. We have also refined our imputation methodology to
   better address the challenge of missing data. The report consists of
   four sections: introduction, findings, main results, and conclusion. In
   the introduction, we discuss the development of the conceptual framework
   and evaluative principles to justify our selection of the dimensions and
   indicators for measurement. Next, in the findings section, we report the
   data, indicators, and our results for each country for each of the 10
   issues we identify, and provide regional comparisons for Asia, Europe,
   North America, Latin America, Africa, and Oceania. In the following
   section, we present the main results for the global justice indices, and
   report the ranking of each country's contribution to achieving greater
   global justice. In the final section, we discuss the applications and
   limitations of the index and potential further research trajectories.},

Abstract = {Academics across Canada, an officially bilingual and multicultural
   country, devote a lot of attention to diversity and representation. This
   is particularly true for political scientists. In this research note, we
   focus on the linguistic composition of panels and overall linguistic
   fragmentation of the most important in-person event for Canadian
   political science: the annual meeting of the Canadian Political Science
   Association (CPSA). To do so, we generated a dataset based on the
   official program of the 2023 annual conference. Our main results are
   twofold. First, we find an important under-representation of
   French-speaking events and academic communications (i.e., panels and
   papers). Second, we computed Herfindahl-Hirschman indexes demonstrating
   that francophone-dominated panels and co-authored papers with
   francophone first authors are significantly more linguistically diverse
   than anglophone panels and papers. Our results highlight important blind
   spots in Canadian political science and help make sense of the lack of
   representation of French-language work in Canadian academia.

Abstract = {Strong foreign relations among nations are crucial for fostering global
   stability, economic growth, and cross-cultural understanding. A stable
   global system that resolves conflicts through dialogue rather than
   confrontation benefits from positive foreign relations. This paper
   examines Turkiye's changing foreign policy approach towards Sub-Saharan
   African regional blocs, with an emphasis on their political, cultural,
   and economic facets. Turkiye's strategic involvement with influential
   regional bodies such as the African Union (AU) and the Economic
   Community of West African States (ECOWAS), among others, reflects its
   broader objective to expand its influence and cultivate multifaceted
   partnerships across the African continent. The scope of this paper is
   limited to the AU and ECOWAS. Through a comprehensive analysis, the
   paper evaluates Turkiye's economic initiatives, including trade
   agreements and investment flows, as well as its contributions to
   infrastructure development. The findings established Turkiye's
   peacekeeping roles, cultural diplomacy, diplomatic efforts, and
   educational exchanges. Through the investigation of these diverse
   aspects, the conclusion outlines a comprehensive understanding of
   Turkiye's place in geopolitical dynamics and regional integration in
   Sub-Saharan Africa.},

Abstract = {China plays a significant role in Afghan reconstruction through its
   economic and political leverage. Consecutive Afghan governments have
   granted China a unique position in their foreign policies. During the
   Republic era, China's diplomatic endeavors in Afghanistan primarily
   focused on addressing security concerns and acting as a broker between
   the Afghan government and the Taliban. The complete withdrawal of U.S.
   troops and the Taliban's return to power in August 2021 presented a new
   opportunity for China in Afghanistan. While China is eager to monitor
   security dynamics and access untapped natural resources, the Taliban-led
   government seeks to gain China's economic and political support.
   However, Afghanistan-China relations may lose momentum under the Islamic
   Emirate, as both sides remain focused on their respective objectives. In
   the long run, a strategic partnership will be necessary to address
   China's security concerns and lay the foundations for Afghanistan's
   economic growth. The Taliban government needs to adopt moderate policies
   conducive to promoting peace, stability, and regional interactions to
   incentivize Chinese investment in Afghan reconstruction. As a major
   regional and global power, China can leverage its influence to implement
   trust-building measures and generate regional consensus to avert a proxy
   conflict in Afghanistan.},

Abstract = {While research on participatory inequalities in organized leisure has
   mainly focused on individual resources and contextual factors, studies
   linking the individual, organizational and contextual levels are
   lacking. This study remedies this by investigating the degree to which
   contextual, organizational and individual factors enhance or inhibit
   participation in membership-based voluntary leisure organizations among
   children and adolescents in Norway. We studied the individual,
   organizational and contextual factors by examining how these factors
   affect participation across municipalities. Our analyses based on
   individual, organizational, and municipal data investigate, using a
   mixed-effects approach, the extent to which organizational resources,
   organizational inclusiveness, and local public policy are associated
   with increased participation in leisure activities. Our findings show
   that contextual factors have little direct explanatory power but
   moderate individual and organizational characteristics while public
   policies addressing the supply of leisure activities are at best
   ineffective and should be aimed to a greater extent at reducing
   socio-economic inequalities at the individual level.},

Abstract = {The role of ideals and idealizations is among the most vigorously
   debated methodological questions in political theory. Yet, the debate
   seems at an impasse. This paper argues that this reflects a fundamental
   ambiguity over idealization's intended inferential logic: the precise
   way in which idealizations might yield normative knowledge. I identify
   two tacit understandings of idealization-a dominant ``telic{''}
   understanding and a less overt ``heuristic{''} understanding-which,
   though importantly different, are rarely distinguished. I argue that
   delineating these understandings, and shifting from telic to heuristic
   idealization, recasts various unresolved methodological problems for
   political theorists, while productively connecting their discussions to
   work on idealization in political science and the practice and
   philosophy of science more broadly. I then provide a systematic account
   of how idealization might be used heuristically in normative reasoning
   and explicate the advantages of such an approach for promoting rigorous,
   relevant, and inclusive methodologies in political theory.},

Title = {`Stick to the status quo'? A conjoint experiment with German adolescents
   on democratic designs},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Volume = {64},

Pages = {851-863},

Abstract = {While representing the next generation of democratic citizens, research
   on process preferences of adolescents is in its infancy. To analyse what
   institutional designs adolescents favour, we conducted a conjoint
   experiment with a unique, representative sample of 1,970 German pupils
   between the age of 14-17. We find that adolescents in general are
   `status quo'- democrats, preferring a parliament (representing the
   central institution of the existing representative system) to
   alternative institutions, namely citizen forums and an assertive leader.
   However, support for the status quo comes with several qualifications,
   namely expert input, slow and considerate political processes and a
   final referendum. Furthermore, we find differences between subgroups,
   whereby dissatisfied adolescents are more open to citizen forums and an
   assertive leader than satisfied adolescents. By contrast, more
   sophisticated adolescents have stronger preferences for the parliament
   as the main institution. Overall, our results suggest that a major
   overhaul of the democratic infrastructure does not seem to be a priority
   for the next generation of citizens, although there is some desire for
   innovation, namely the `blending' of representative institutions with
   more citizen participation.},

Abstract = {Drawing upon the Latin American Presidential and Legislative Elections
   database and our own original data set, we assess the effects of
   structural adjustment and other economic factors on presidential
   electoral volatility in 24 Latin American countries in 1982-2016. The
   results of our study indicate that both structural adjustment and
   inflation have a positive association with Type B presidential electoral
   volatility (the volatility generated from changes in the vote shares of
   established parties). Economic growth appears to have only a weak
   negative association with overall presidential electoral volatility.
   Type A presidential electoral volatility (the volatility associated with
   the rise of new parties) is mostly determined by demographic factors and
   the electoral system for the presidency. As with legislative volatility
   in Latin America, Africa, and postcommunist Europe, explaining stable
   party presidential volatility appears more challenging than explaining
   party replacement presidential volatility. Overall, several of the
   findings about legislative volatility are echoed in this study, but
   presidential electoral volatility is notably higher than legislative
   volatility in Latin America.},

Abstract = {Racial and ethnic minorities are underrepresented in most Western
   democracies. This article investigates one potential root cause behind
   this pattern: minority and majority citizens might expect to feel
   discriminated against if they enter politics. Using data from three
   large-scale surveys, we find that minorities in both the United States
   and Sweden are less likely to expect to feel welcome than the majority
   population. These discrepancies in expected discrimination persist, even
   after controlling for other factors. Moreover, expected discrimination
   is not without political consequences: those who expect to feel less
   welcome are less likely to indicate an interest in running for political
   office. Finally, these results do not differ for politically engaged
   citizens who constitute a more realistic pool of potential candidates.
   We conclude by discussing what expectations of discrimination can tell
   us about the fairness of the political system and how these attitudes
   shape political ambition among minorities.},

Abstract = {On August 15, 2021, American military forces withdrew from Kabul, and
   the sanctioning of Afghanistan began. Marred by the usual
   problems-ineffective, counterproductive, unwieldy-these sanctions
   revealed three additional puzzles. First, although grounded in targeted
   sanctions, they transformed into de facto comprehensive sanctions.
   Secondly, that transformation was instantaneous and unprompted. Thirdly,
   a near-famine followed within weeks. I make nested analytical,
   functional, and explanatory arguments. The analytical argument is that
   targeted sanctions are best understood not as tools of international
   coercion but primarily as domestic regulations. The functional argument
   is that the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) uses tactical and
   strategic ambiguity to maximize its regulatory reach over financial
   intuitions, humanitarian aid organizations, and money transfer
   organizations. The explanatory argument returns to the puzzles. I argue
   that, without any signal from OFAC, which was the signal, and reflecting
   OFAC's regulatory domination, when the Taliban took Kabul, the
   international financial community, humanitarian aid organizations, and
   remittance providers all dissociated from Afghanistan with immediate
   effect and particularly acute consequences on food entitlements.},

Title = {The substantive representation of men: Intersectionality, masculinities,
   and men's interests},

Abstract = {Men's numerical over-representation in politics leads to complacency
   regarding their substantive representation. Yet the men in politics are
   not descriptively representative of most men and are drawn
   disproportionately from the most socially privileged groups. Building on
   theories of representation, intersectionality and masculinities, I argue
   that men have gendered representational needs that are not adequately
   met. Power structures among men leave many men marginalized and/or
   subordinated, and disincentivize the privileged men in power from
   defending disadvantaged men's interests. Masculinist cultures within
   politics inhibit discussion of male vulnerability and further undermine
   the substantive representation of men. I make the case for why we should
   study men's substantive representation and then show how we could do so.
   I propose a groundbreaking research agenda for identifying and measuring
   men's diverse representational needs, recognizing how these are shaped
   by gender and its intersection with other identities. Combining insights
   from objectivist, constructivist and intersectional approaches, I
   develop a framework for measuring the substantive representation of men
   that explores who represents men, which ideology informs their claims,
   which men are included and excluded and whether the goals of
   representation are to transform or uphold the status quo. I offer
   several illuminations of policies where different men have distinct
   gendered needs, and offer an extended example using educational outcomes
   in the United Kingdom to illustrate how privileged men are not effective
   representatives of disadvantaged men. This article builds the normative
   case and offers the theoretical tools for addressing an important gap in
   the study of representation.},

Abstract = {Do informational and financial resources systematically secure interest
   group access and influence on public policy, and is one of these two
   resources politically more valuable than the other? Answering these
   questions is vital to understanding some of the drivers of political
   inequality and skewed influence associated with contemporary democratic
   politics. Focusing on two of the most commonly mobilized types of
   resources-money and information-this article reviews 60 studies on the
   topic. First, a qualitative synthesis shows that informational resources
   tend to be at least partially positively related to access and
   influence, while financial resources are more ambiguously associated
   with both outcomes. Second, a series of meta-regressions support this
   conclusion since they tend toward showing that informational resources
   are significantly stronger associated with these outcomes than financial
   resources. Thus, these results paint a more nuanced picture than the
   literature suggesting that moneyed interests subvert democratic
   politics.},

Abstract = {Pivotal legislators' positions are critical to legislative outcomes, but
   does this heightened importance in policymaking translate into
   heightened electoral accountability or voter knowledge? Arguments about
   clarity of responsibility suggest that pivotal legislators, who are
   decisive in determining legislative outcomes, may be held to higher
   standards, while perspectives rooted in electoral incentives for
   position taking suggest they may not. Two survey experiments show that
   voters do not respond more strongly to pivotal legislators' votes on
   policy. Moreover, observational data analysis rejects the expectation
   that constituents have more knowledge about the votes of pivotal
   moderate legislators compared to non-pivotal moderate legislators. These
   results suggest that pivotal legislators face similar, if not lower,
   accountability for their votes. Combined with the policy-concessions
   pivotal legislators can secure, these patterns point to the benefits
   that accrue to pivotal legislators from institutional rules that give
   them key veto power over policy.},

Abstract = {Despite globalization's distributional impacts, we know little about
   (potentially differential) tax preferences of trade winners and losers,
   especially within social classes. We assess tax burden preferences to
   sustain public good provision using a vignette experiment with
   randomized tax instruments in the context of a liberalizing economy.
   More specifically, we analyze data from an original, randomized
   household survey of 1008 individuals in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, in
   2019. We study preferences for increases in personal income,
   value-added, or corporate income taxes to improve funding for the
   universal health care system after Brazil adopts its free trade deal
   with the European Union. Findings reveal that the trade-losing poor
   support progressive taxes, whereas the trade-winning poor favor
   regressive instruments. By dividing the poor, globalization may create a
   barrier against more progressive fiscal strategies in emerging
   economies.},

Abstract = {Local visits by party leaders are an integral part of election
   campaigning around the world. In the age of media-driven elections, do
   they matter? How are local contests selected for a visit? Most
   importantly, what effect do they have on the vote? Using a unique
   dataset covering local visits by the major party leaders during the 2013
   and 2022 Australian federal election campaigns, we address these
   questions. We find that marginality is the main criterion for selecting
   a seat for a visit, followed by its geographical location. Leader visits
   in 2013 mattered more to the vote than in 2022. We explain the
   differences between the two elections and the four leaders by the
   relative standing of each of the leaders among voters. Overall, we
   conclude that the electoral impact of a leader visit is modest and
   context-dependent.},

Abstract = {The hydraulic paradigm, still in force in a large part of water
   decisions in Spain, exemplifies how conventional water policies are
   incapable of understanding and even less of managing the multiple levels
   of complexity surrounding water. This demands a new perspective on water
   policies and governance. This contribution focuses on one of the
   essential aspects for such advanced water governance: the science-policy
   interface. To do so, different modes of relationship between knowledge
   and policy making are synthesized, such as the technocratic-
   legitimizing mode, the ``red book{''} mode, the advisory and
   participation mode and the coproduction of policies. The key components
   for a co-production of water policies are then presented, which include
   a participatory approach, the use of the best available knowledge, the
   deliberation on alternatives, the adaptive cyclical management and the
   explicit consideration of risk. Finally, a proposal is made on how to
   operationalize a science-policy interface in the coproduction of water
   policies through various phases, identifying those corresponding to the
   sphere of science/knowledge, that of social preferences/non-academic
   actors and that of a shared area.},

Abstract = {How does political representation affect conservation? We argue that the
   mixed evidence in the literature may be driven by institutional
   arrangements that provide authority to marginalized communities, but do
   not make adequate arrangements to truly boost their voice in resource
   management. We study a 1996 law that created local government councils
   with mandated representation for India's Scheduled Tribes (ST), a
   community of one hundred million. Using difference-in-differences
   designs, we find that the dramatic increase in ST representation led to
   a substantial increase in tree cover and a reduction in deforestation.
   We present suggestive evidence that representation enabled marginalized
   communities to better pursue their interests, which, unlike commercial
   operations such as mining, are compatible with forest conservation.
   While conservation policy tends to stress environmentally focused
   institutions, we suggest more attention be given to umbrella
   institutions, such as political representation, which can address
   conservation and development for marginalized communities in tandem.},

Abstract = {This article examines the position that three Scandinavian countries -
   Sweden, Norway, and Denmark - had assumed on the newly proposed crime of
   genocide and an international convention that addressed it. While the
   Great Powers' politics vis-\& agrave;-vis the draft Genocide Convention
   have been examined in detail, points of contestation and major concerns
   of so-called lesser democracies remain largely unexplored. Within the
   context of the UN Genocide Convention, the Scandinavian countries lived
   up to their reputation of democracies guided by the rule of law, yet
   with a caveat. The tenor of the interoffice discussions in the
   respective ministries in Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Oslo somewhat
   differed from the official statements of the representatives of Denmark,
   Sweden, and Norway in the United Nations. In aligning the provisions of
   the draft convention with the domestic legislation, the Scandinavian
   governments displayed the manifest lack of idealism. They regarded the
   passing of the Genocide Convention as an important milestone, though not
   at any cost. When it comes to evaluating the overall performance of each
   of the three Scandinavian countries, Denmark largely remained on
   sidelines. Norway approached the drafting of the Genocide Convention
   from a perspective of the national law. On the skepticism curve, Denmark
   (alongside Belgium and the United Kingdom) scored the highest. Norway
   was not far behind, though publicly it positioned itself as a principled
   supporter of the Genocide Convention (not unlike the United States).
   Sweden, then, belonged among the undecided. Significantly, due to the
   adopted policy of sustaining international cooperation, the Scandinavian
   countries did not follow the great powers in openly voicing their
   skepticism toward the Genocide Convention. Of the three Scandinavian
   delegations, the Norwegian had most consistently taken the middle road
   in order to ensure the broadest possible support for the Genocide
   Convention.},

Abstract = {The protection of civilians has moved from the periphery to the core of
   public perceptions of what UN peacekeeping is for. At the same time, the
   operational and tactical arts of civilian protection have become better
   developed, more sophisticated, and more widely known. This turn towards
   protection has improved UN peacekeeping and, more importantly, saved
   civilian lives. This piece shows that together, the essays in this
   collection suggest a need to think more holistically about by situating
   practices of UN peacekeeping along a broader continuum of practice
   comprising local actors, unarmed civilian protectors at one end, a more
   fulsome understanding of the role of UN police and national authorities
   in the middle, and - at the other end - difficult questions about
   humanitarian intervention.},

Abstract = {While states increasingly govern migration through the administration
   and distribution of death, they occasionally invest considerable
   resources in recovering, identifying, and burying dead migrants. How to
   explain this paradox? A forceful argument in the critical scholarship on
   migration and citizenship maintains that death sometimes compels states
   to acknowledge the humanity of the migrants and grant them some degree
   of posthumous citizenship. In this article, we advance a view that is
   both different and complementary. We suggest that burying dead migrants
   is a way for the state and its host population to affirm and celebrate
   their own humanity. This perspective rests on three arguments: to be
   human is to bury; the ultimate act of humanity is not burying the loved
   ones but the enemies; burying dead migrants can be compared to burying
   dead enemy soldiers. The article sheds further light on the still
   underexplored phenomenon of `caring for dead migrants' and assesses how
   these practices of care challenge but also reinforce dominant
   exclusionary understandings of citizenship.},

Volume = {77},
Number = {3},
Pages = {835-850},

Abstract = {In examining public evaluations of governing institutions, are job
   approval and legitimacy related? This question has dominated scholarship
   on Supreme Court legitimacy for decades. Conventional wisdom suggests
   that specific support (e.g., job approval) and diffuse support (e.g.,
   legitimacy) are independent. Specific support captures short-term
   orientations based on policy alignment with the Court. Legitimacy is a
   long-term perspective reflecting more fundamental support for the Court
   as a governing institution. We challenge the paradigm that job approval
   and legitimacy are largely unrelated concepts. Specifically, we employ a
   variety of statistical techniques and panel data to show that changes in
   legitimacy are a direct effect of changes in public approval. Salient
   decisions and Court vacancies directly shape approval and indirectly
   shape legitimacy through their effects on approval. Longitudinal
   analysis confirms that changes in job approval precede and predict
   changes in legitimacy. These results suggest that the Court needs public
   approval, and its public approval is rooted in outcome-oriented
   perceptions of its decisions and membership. Further, sustained low
   levels of approval will eventually erode legitimacy and limit the
   Court's influence over policy. Thus, like the outwardly political
   executive and legislative branches, it is important for the Court to
   build political capital through job approval.},

Abstract = {The UK's in-out referendum on European Union membership is often
   attributed to an incompatibility inherent in the UK-EU relationship, or
   else a rising tide of Euroscepticism forcing a reckoning. We argue that
   the referendum should be understood as the culmination of parliamentary
   `referendum games' in the preceding years, whereby backbenchers
   periodically applied pressure to office-seeking leaders who
   strategically defused this by promising public votes. These games were
   episodic and escalatory, coinciding with integrative European treaties
   which activated transient Eurosceptic backlashes. While referendum
   avoidance was personally rational, leaders' repeated parlays created a
   standalone referendum politics, ratcheting up the intensity of backbench
   demands based on past promises and democratic renewal. After the Lisbon
   Treaty, a tipping point was reached, transforming calls for a `brake' on
   integration to demand for binary `exit' vote at the next treaty moment.
   This accompanied the Euro-area crisis in 2011, effectively ending David
   Cameron's discretion to continue the game. To show this, we plot all
   mentions of EU-related referendums and adjacent terms in the House of
   Commons between 2000 and 2015. We descriptively identify five peak
   salience flares around EU treaty moments and then analyse 263
   interventions by Members of Parliament to show how referendum pressure
   ratcheted up over time.},

Abstract = {Increased focus on the judicial qualifications of female U.S. Supreme
   Court nominees prompts an examination of barriers obstructing women's
   rise to this apex position. Contrary to scholars who emphasize
   ``pipeline{''} theories of how increased women in the law will de facto
   increase the number of women in the judiciary, or that ideology as the
   primary predictor of confirmation votes regardless of gender, we argue
   that women nominees appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee must
   also clear an additional gendered hurdle. Incorporating the literature
   on the double bind and gender norm theories of women in leadership, we
   scrutinize all formal opening statements from Supreme Court nominees
   between 1981 and 2022 to decipher challenges female nominees' encounter.
   Using a structural topic model approach to compare opening statements
   from men and women nominees, we demonstrate how societal constructs
   compel women nominees to navigate a precarious path toward confirmation.
   We find that women nominees must fashion themselves as both strong legal
   advocate and soft, feminine wife and mother, exemplifying gendered
   social roles and the double bind for women in leadership. These findings
   bear significance for comprehending women's underrepresentation in the
   judiciary and how gender biases permeate the hearing process beyond
   Senatorial bias.},

Abstract = {Using a major field test (MFT) is a common method of program assessment.
   For accurate assessment to take place, however, students must be
   sufficiently motivated to perform. This paper studies a change in major
   requirements that associated a major field test to a grade in a
   political science capstone course. After controlling for possible
   confounders like Gender, Age, Ethnicity, and differences in GPA and ACT
   scores, a modest but statistically significant treatment effect was
   found. However, the fit between a student's program GPA and MFT scores
   did not improve, leading to questions about how best to assess political
   science knowledge for program graduates.},

Abstract = {Do policy priorities that candidates emphasize during election campaigns
   predict their subsequent legislative activities? We study this question
   by assembling novel data on legislative leadership posts held by
   Japanese politicians and using a fine-tuned transformer-based machine
   learning model to classify policy areas in over 46,900 statements from
   1270 candidate manifestos across five elections. We find that a higher
   emphasis on a policy issue increases the probability of securing a
   legislative post in the same area. This relationship remains consistent
   across multiple elections and persists even when accounting for
   candidates' previous legislative leadership roles. We also discover
   greater congruence in distributive policy areas. Our findings indicate
   that campaigns provide meaningful signals of policy priorities.},

Abstract = {The US has experienced runaway economic inequality since the 1970s, yet
   there is no strong public support for government efforts that serve to
   narrow the growing disparities between citizens. Why? I point to the
   role of rising racial diversity. I argue Americans believe in
   conditional equality, where they support equalizing policies as long as
   they perceive the beneficiaries as people like themselves. However, as
   the country grows more diverse, citizens are less likely to perceive
   those around them as people like themselves. Using time-series
   cross-sectional data of the American states, I demonstrate that as
   racial diversity increases, the likelihood the public will respond to
   increasing inequality by supporting bigger government declines. This
   study provides evidence for the mechanism usually implied but rarely
   tested by studies of diversity and policy: mass preferences.},

Abstract = {The initial outright rejection of shorter working hours by many
   employers has been replaced by their sustained campaign to recoup lost
   time by raising the work intensity of their employees and its impact on
   fixed capital. But longer working hours imposed in some countries as
   part of the neoliberal globalized attack on the living standards of
   workers since the 1980s, have called into question both marginalist and
   Marxist explanations of the reasons behind falling and rising working
   hours. This article investigates-from a Marxist standpoint-the combined
   impact of shorter working hours, rising productivity and labour
   intensity both theoretically and in practice, during the first two
   decades of this century in Chile. This article investigates the probable
   impact on the economy and its division into wages and profits, of a cut
   in the working week and changes in labour flexibility.},

Abstract = {The stability of Irish democracy since 1922 is often a cause for
   contentment with lines of succession drawn from `Grattan's parliament',
   O'Connell's popular movement, and the achievements of the Irish
   Parliamentary Party (IPP) at Westminster through to D \& aacute;il \&
   Eacute;ireann. The IPP certainly disrupted the Commons, yet Irish
   politics was also shaped by the `mother of parliaments' - MPs mastered
   parliamentary procedure and home rule legislation drew on British and
   colonial parliamentary models. By 1918, the party's machine and
   parliamentary behaviour were rejected as much as British rule - but as
   Michael Laffan suggested, Sinn F \& eacute;in triumphed by beating the
   home rulers at their own game. However, the 1922 constitution gave
   generous expression to the sovereignty of the people, and for judicial
   review. But, within short succession, facility for popular initiative
   was overridden. Ironically, the Irish Free State would never be amended
   by popular will or judicial review but by parliamentary majority in 25
   amendments as the people only voted to adopt it in 1922 and replace it
   in 1937. In practice then, it was closer to a vision of Dicey's
   supremacy of parliament dogma that prevailed, so much so, that Se \&
   aacute;n Lemass acrimoniously proclaimed in 1934: `this is a sovereign
   assembly'.},

Abstract = {Research shows that U.S. Supreme Court events garner media attention,
   but the extent of public engagement remains uncertain. We examine online
   engagements with Supreme Court coverage, spanning the periods before,
   during, and after a scandal involving Justice Clarence Thomas drew broad
   media attention in April 2023. Analyzing internet browsing behavior of a
   nationally representative sample and Google Trends data, we discovered
   minimal interest in the Court prior to the scandal (3\% seeking
   information). After the scandal, attention increased by 300\% and stayed
   high for weeks. While Democratic participants were the most likely to
   seek out information about the Court following the scandal, we still
   observe strong effects among Republican participants, too. These results
   highlight how extra-judicial events draw attention to the Court and lead
   to lasting interest in it. Furthermore, our digital trace analysis of
   Supreme Court information seeking offers insights for scholars studying
   a variety of political topics.},

Abstract = {The world can no longer deny that the planet is on the brink of
   catastrophe. While scientists from various fields and around the world
   debate the causes, impacts, challenges, and solutions to the arrival of
   the Anthropocene, a new geological era induced by humans, the field of
   law can not stay behind. Rights of Nature (RoN), which grant legal
   personality to nature and its elements, such as rivers, constitute an
   emerging transnational legal framework rapidly gaining ground among
   Euro-American legal scholars and practitioners as a new tool to combat
   environmental destruction. Based on reflections derived from long-term
   collaborative ethnographic work with Indigenous communities through
   research projects different, this article aims to critically and
   empirically unveil several interrelated concerns and blind spots at this
   snowballing moment of RoN worldwide. This includes considerations
   regarding claims that this new legal proposal is rooted in indigenous
   lifestyles and perspectives on nature and the environment.},

Abstract = {In their contribution, Tsebelis and Nardi (2016a) examine the impact of
   constitutional design on economic performance. The authors find evidence
   of a significant negative relationship between constitutional length and
   economic performance. As we will show here, the results of Tsebelis and
   Nardi (2016a) are not robust. Several minor adjustments to the models,
   each on its own, reduce or eliminate the presumed relevance of
   constitutional length. Moreover, conceptual considerations raise doubts
   whether the focus on constitutional length is a promising path to
   follow.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},

Volume = {77},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Sexual violence against men in conflict settings is neither a rare nor
   recent phenomenon, yet its absence in academic scholarship and
   humanitarian initiatives remains glaring. Despite the advances in our
   understanding of the determinants of wartime sexual violence against
   women, surprisingly little empirical research exists on sexual violence
   against men in conflict. Acts of sexual violence are commonly enacted
   against men in war, yet because they do not fit more narrow definitions
   of rape, accounts of these experiences are often misclassified as
   ``torture.{''} Moreover, in many countries experiencing pervasive
   conflict-related sexual violence, there exist restrictive laws regarding
   sodomy and homosexuality, reducing the chances that males will report
   their experiences. Using originally coded data on sexual and gender
   identity laws and reported incidents of sexual violence in civil
   conflict, I find that laws that outline the protection of sexual and
   gender identity expression including the decriminalization of same-sex
   activity are significantly associated with reports of acts of sexual
   violence against men. The results speak to the gap in the literature on
   male sexual violence with tangible consequences for the distribution of
   humanitarian aid, availability of medical and psychological services for
   victims, and aims of peacekeeping missions.},

Pages = {70-77},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {BBC funding (the licence fee model and the funding level) has been
   turned into a big issue out of all proportion to the low financial
   stakes-equivalent to the cost of one takeaway coffee a week for the
   whole household, excluding those with free TV licences. This article
   first proposes and explores three possible reasons for all the fuss:
   that licence payers take the BBC for granted, underestimating the value
   they get from it; that the attacks on BBC funding are part of a wider
   `war' against it, driven by commercial or political vested interests;
   and that at least some of the criticisms of the licence fee reflect
   genuine, although much exaggerated, disadvantages. The article then
   evaluates four alternative funding models: advertising, subscriptions,
   general taxation and a universal household levy. It argues that the best
   long-term model would be a flat, universal household levy, with
   exemptions for those least able to pay, as in Germany, with the funding
   level set by an independent body organised by Ofcom; and that, because
   the licence fee is becoming harder to sustain, this new funding model
   should be introduced at the start of the next BBC Charter in January
   2028.},

Abstract = {Various robust communication effects have been identified, but evidence
   is overwhelmingly based on artificial survey treatments with limited
   real-world insight. I conducted a natural experiment on the impact of
   the European-Turkey statement closing the Balkan route during the
   2015/16 European refugee crisis in Germany. This design tests the
   lasting effect of the statement's framing on public sentiment. I
   identify treatment and control groups based on timing to demonstrate its
   effect on perceptions of the crisis, asylum attitudes, and policy
   preferences. Effects are largest immediately following the announcement
   but decline rapidly. This shows political communication can
   significantly change opinion within a limited time frame. This study
   enhances our understanding of real-world communication effects and
   offers a broadly applicable methodology.},

Abstract = {Which peculiar uncertainties does democratic erosion (DE) pose to
   opposition actors? How have these uncertainties influenced the behavior
   of opposition actors during Turkey's autocratization since the early
   2000s? What can we learn from this case regarding the links between DE
   and opposition behavior? The latter should be treated as an integral
   part of explaining DE-the gradual decline in the quality of multiple
   aspects of democracy under popularly elected governments. We argue that
   a contextual uncertainty, ``regime uncertainty{''} (RU) challenged
   Turkish opposition actors, compounding the other and related
   uncertainties they faced such as institutional and strategic
   uncertainties and affecting their resilience against DE. RU concerns the
   ambivalence that DE's inherent qualities generate about what the regime
   is, or is becoming. The resulting intra-opposition divisions and
   indecisions raise the question of whether the primary context, frame and
   end of opposition politics should be issue- and party-based competitive
   politics or defending democracy against an imminent threat. Hence, RU
   generates recurring rifts over ``normal{''} versus ``extraordinary{''}
   politics. We analyze the Turkish experience and intra-opposition
   politics in four sub-periods (nascent DE, consolidation of erosive
   power, advanced DE, breakdown and post-breakdown opposition
   experimentation). Turkish opposition actors' RU perceptions and
   resulting behaviors evolved on highly non-linear paths. We offer novel
   analytical/theoretical tools and argue that the agency and capacity of
   oppositions to overcome RU in a country, alongside their ability to
   surmount other challenges, should be considered an integral part of
   democratic resilience against erosion.},

Abstract = {This comprehensive study of political vigilantism in Ghana examines the
   motives, membership, and financing of the phenomenon and proffers
   solutions to combat it. We use a qualitative methodology of personal
   interviews with a broad section of Ghanaian political stakeholders
   totaling 50 participants. This included 30 political vigilante members
   equally affiliated with the New Patriotic Party and the National
   Democratic Congress and selected from the vigilante hotbeds of the
   Northern, Upper East, and Ashanti regions of Ghana. The other political
   stakeholders total 20 and are made up of: five public political party
   executives, five civil society members, five police officers, and five
   local district assembly members. The motives include institutional
   weakness, winning political power, and economic and group solidarity.
   Membership involves family and friends, former security personnel, party
   members, and unemployed youth. Financing emanates from political
   parties, politicians, and the business class. We argue that
   patron-clientelism is the driving force behind political vigilantism and
   recommend more legal accountability for patrons, particularly through
   constitutional amendments guaranteeing a fixed term for the head of the
   police and separating the roles of Attorney General and Minister of
   Justice. This is to ensure that the former can impartially prosecute
   vigilante patrons. Punitive financial measures are also recommended to
   deter patrons, backed by sustained public education and more employment
   opportunities for the masses of unemployed youth-the bedrock of
   political vigilantism.},

Abstract = {Technological change often increases demand for high-skilled jobs, with
   low-skilled losers turning to the populist right in response. The
   political effects of technological change that increases demand for
   low-skilled workers are largely unknown. The growth of the salmon
   fish-farming industry in rural Norway improved the labor-market
   situation for low-skilled workers, and we find that support for the
   populist right-wing party increased in municipalities that benefitted
   from the industry growth. The electoral change is due to a right-wing
   shift on the economic, but not the cultural dimension. Our results
   support political economy frameworks that point to lower demand for
   state interventions after positive labor market shocks, but raise the
   question of in what contexts support for populism will decline.},

Abstract = {This article reflects on the potential and limitations of global
   citizenship as a concept by which to analyse the politics of precarious
   migration and develops a novel methodology by which to generate an
   inventory of migratory claims. It focuses specifically on migratory
   claims-making in the context of externalisation, whereby proliferating
   actants and complex practices of cross-border control render
   accountability for harm increasingly obscure. Emphasising the importance
   of centring the claims of people with lived experiences of precarious
   migration in the analysis of the politics of migration, the article
   develops an analytical framework that includes implicit and indirect as
   well as explicit and direct claims to rights, belonging and
   accountability. The significance of such a framework is explored through
   an engagement with the testimonies of people crossing the Mediterranean
   from the Middle East and Africa during 2015-2016. Reflecting on the
   value as well as the problems of interpreting migratory claims through
   the lens of global citizenship, the article suggests that the concept
   should neither be disregarded nor reified in analyses of the politics of
   precarious migration.},

Abstract = {This paper uses a conjoint survey experiment fielded in the US,
   Australia, Chile, and Argentina to develop and test the compensatory
   theory of tax fairness, which states that higher taxes on the rich can
   be used to compensate for other benefits unequally granted by the state.
   Drawing on social psychology, this paper argues that evidence of
   preferential treatment by the state violates well-established fairness
   principles and shows, experimentally, that it leads to taxation to
   restore equality in crisis times, irrespective of wealth and across a
   variety of settings. The paper makes two important contributions: it
   provides the first direct, causal evidence of the importance of
   compensatory arguments for tax preferences and presents unconfounded
   estimates of the effect of more established fairness considerations as
   benchmarks against which to compare the importance of compensatory
   arguments.},

Abstract = {This study explores the role of foreign aid as a soft power tool by
   providing an understanding of the interrelation between foreign policy
   and aid. The study is based on interviews with aid experts. The findings
   of the study unambiguously demonstrate that aid and foreign policy are
   intertwined since, in most cases, foreign aid falls under the
   responsibility of foreign ministries. Besides the humanitarian
   imperative, the geopolitical account has a crucial importance in the
   decision-making process that cascades down from the general foreign
   policy agenda. In addition, the strategic interests of the donor country
   are contributing to the decision-making. The prominent themes are
   national security, tackling terrorism, preventing immigration influx,
   and economic goals. The study also demonstrates the extent to which aid
   can be politicized in its extreme form by focusing on Russian vetoes in
   the UN Security Council and the Syrian government's weaponization of
   aid.},

Abstract = {Although Greece and Albania share extensive historical, economic,
   social, and security ties due to their NATO membership, their bilateral
   relations from time to time have been problematic, raising concerns for
   the broader Western Balkans. Several unresolved issues between Athens
   and Tirana that have their roots in the past prevent the normalization
   of their relations and, as a result, create obstacles for Albanias' EU
   accession process. The respect of the Greek minority rights in Albania,
   the delimitation of maritime zones, Greeces' Law of War with Albania,
   the Cham issue, that Tirana unilaterally raise the refusal of Athens to
   recognize the independence of Kosovo and the arrest of the elected
   member of the Greek National Minority Mayor of Himare are some of the
   issues between the two countries. It is the aim of this article to study
   recent normative and empirical discourse to argue that the normalization
   of the relations between Albania and Greece is crucial for the EUs'
   enlargement with the countries of Western Balkans and for the stability
   of the region in general. Within this context, this article analyzes the
   historical background of the bilateral relations between Greece and
   Albania, evaluates the current economic, social, and political
   situation, and presents some policy proposals before reaching a
   conclusion.},

Abstract = {This article argues that Alexis de Tocqueville's political philosophy
   was shaped by his personal encounters with Native Americans. By
   unearthing his letters and posthumously published writings, this article
   reveals how these experiences helped him think through key theoretical
   concepts he used in Democracy in America, such as freedom, restlessness,
   and justice. This article advances the work of scholars who have
   recognized the noteworthy aspects of Tocqueville's encounters and
   intervenes in recent scholarship that views him as either indifferent to
   the fate of Native Americans or operating within a settler colonial
   ideology. Tocqueville's engagement with Native Americans is more
   substantive and positive than previously believed. Overall, this article
   prompts scholars to reexamine Democracy with fresh eyes-to see how
   Native Americans helped Tocqueville understand modern liberal democracy.},

   establish a parallel between Finland/Catalonia and the Russian

   the Civil Government of Barcelona. The use of this episode of Finnish
   history through a play was part of Catalan nationalism's continued will
   to find external models and to use relevant moments of other European
   nationalist movements to explain itself.},

Abstract = {In 2015, the UK government was the first to introduce a statutory
   obligation, also known as the ``Prevent duty{''}, on all education
   institutions, including Higher and Further Education, universities and
   colleges, in England and Wales, to prevent people from being drawn into
   terrorism. The duty, promoted by the UK Home Office as another
   safeguarding measure, acted as an extension to the UK's Prevent Strategy
   (CONTEST), first published in 2006. The duty in schools came under
   scrutiny as national security measures of surveillance and reporting
   conflict with what education stands for, that is, a space for social,
   intellectual growth and the formation of one's identity. There is little
   literature examining how secondary school teachers attempt to prevent
   radicalisation through teaching practices. To fill this gap, interviews
   were carried out with 13 secondary school teachers, teaching different
   subjects at Key Stage 3/4 in England to investigate their views on what
   informs their choice of pedagogical methods to prevent radicalisation
   and how they engage with the curriculum to enact the duty. To contrast
   teachers' views, 14 Prevent Practitioners in England were interviewed to
   examine whether correct interpretation and implementation of the Prevent
   duty was taking place. Findings show that whilst the duty's main
   objective in schools is for teachers to signal and report potential
   radicalised students, teachers feel that Prevent policy and training
   requires strengthening to equip them with a sound knowledge of what
   violent radicalisation entails, and pedagogical tools to help them
   prevent radicalisation through educational teaching practices and their
   subject curriculum.},

Abstract = {China's security sector assistance (SSA) to Mali since the 2012 crisis
   may have potential unintended consequences on state fragility. Paa Kwesi
   Wolseley Prah explores how China's aid, which aims to equip Mali to
   address terrorism and insurgency, may cause further damage - through
   increased dependence on China, militarisation and human rights abuses by
   security forces, and reduced accountability, fuelling corruption. An
   integrated approach is needed for SSA to support stability in Mali
   without exacerbating vulnerabilities.},

Abstract = {We evaluate whether feelings of state pride in the USA are linked to the
   quality of democracy in one's state. Using two original surveys, we find
   no relationship between an objective measure of the quality of state
   democracy and feelings of state pride. In contrast, we find a consistent
   positive relationship between subjective evaluations and state pride
   such that citizens with more positive evaluations of the quality of
   democracy in their state report higher levels of state pride.
   Interestingly, feelings of state pride are not linked to the objective
   measure of democracy even when citizens are informed of where their
   state ranks in a survey experiment. However, subsample analyses reveal
   that there is a relationship between the objective measure and state
   pride among Democrats and political ``losers{''} (citizens living in
   states where the government is controlled by the opposite party). We
   conclude by discussing implications for citizenship and state pride in
   an era of democratic erosion.},

Abstract = {There is a lingering myth in the international compliance literature
   that domestic multilevel structures have a negative impact on the
   fulfilment of international commitments. This article argues that this
   literature has failed to understand multilevel structures as a
   multi-layered concept. Instead of viewing multilevel governance as a
   one-dimensional concept or a mere system of veto-players, I propose to
   study the effects of the individual components, i.e., federalism,
   decentral governance, and joint decision-making. I test the plausibility
   of this approach by analyzing the implementation of the Ramsar Wetlands
   Convention. My findings debunk the myth about the negative effects of
   multilevel structures on the implementation of international agreements.
   I show that states in which subnational decision-makers can act
   autonomously from the central level are better placed to produce
   implementation measures in the area of environmental conservation.},

Abstract = {Competitiveness in electoral authoritarian regimes is compromised by
   management of the electoral arena through various kinds of manipulation.
   This study links two dimensions of competitiveness, namely fairness and
   contestation. We analyze the regional heterogeneity of both dimensions
   for Russian gubernatorial elections held between 2012 and 2019. To
   assess competitiveness, we use crowd-sourced electoral observation
   reports and data from the Central Election Commission. Our analysis
   reveals significant regional variation in both dimensions. Nevertheless,
   opposition victories are rare and only occur in exceptional cases. Low
   levels of electoral malpractices seem to be a necessary but not
   sufficient condition for close election results. Windows of opportunity
   for the opposition arise only if the regime misperceives the closeness
   of the race and if the opposition nominates prominent candidates.
   Overall, these findings shed light on the complex factors influencing
   the competitiveness of elections in electoral authoritarian regimes like
   Russia.},

Abstract = {Granular geographic data present new opportunities to understand how
   neighborhoods are formed, and how they influence politics. At the same
   time, the inherent subjectivity of neighborhoods creates methodological
   challenges in measuring and modeling them. We develop an open-source
   survey instrument that allows respondents to draw their neighborhoods on
   a map. We also propose a statistical model to analyze how the
   characteristics of respondents and local areas determine subjective
   neighborhoods. We conduct two surveys: collecting subjective
   neighborhoods from voters in Miami, New York City, and Phoenix, and
   asking New York City residents to draw a community of interest for
   inclusion in their city council district. Our analysis shows that,
   holding other factors constant, white respondents include census blocks
   with more white residents in their neighborhoods. Similarly, Democrats
   and Republicans are more likely to include co-partisan areas.
   Furthermore, our model provides more accurate out-of-sample predictions
   than standard neighborhood measures.},

Abstract = {Populism is principally a political phenomenon; yet, the economic
   implications of populist rule can be substantial, as underlined by the
   Polish and Hungarian cases. By operationalizing the ideational
   definition of populism, the article sheds light on the economic
   consequences of populist governance in three major domains: (1)
   macroeconomic management, (2) welfare policies, and (3) market
   regulation. The article demonstrates that while-at least until the
   outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic-Hungary and Poland refrained from
   engaging in irresponsible macroeconomic policies such as the
   accumulation of public debt or external debt (typical signs of classical
   ``economic populism{''}), the governments of the two countries embarked
   on widescale income and wealth redistribution in their respective
   economies. Nevertheless, these populist governments targeted different
   groups of people in their redistributive policies: Hungary adopted a
   largely selective and exclusive social policy targeting the middle class
   and the well off, while Poland endorsed a more inclusive strategy that
   benefited the poor as well. Furthermore, the two countries deliberately
   tilted the playing field toward their proteges: Hungary preferred the
   preservation of private property; whereas, Poland explicitly increased
   the share and role of state-owned enterprises in the economy.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do riotous-violent protests increase the
   likelihood of protest success? The protest literature has largely found
   that riotous-violent protests (RVPs) are not effective. However, a
   burgeoning literature contradicts these findings. We extend this
   literature by exploring how waves of RVPs increase the likelihood of
   protest success. Protesters learn from past protest-government response
   dyads, which reduces the costs of continued protest in the face of
   repression. The temporal accumulation of riotous-violent protests
   exhausts the resources and collective will of the regime to continually
   hold out on protester demands. Thus, as the number of RVPs increases in
   a country-year, we expect there to be a coinciding increase in instances
   of government accommodation. Furthermore, we argue that democracy
   conditions the relationship between waves of RVPs and protest success.
   We conduct a cross-national observational data analysis of 119 countries
   from 1990 to 2019 using data from the Mass Mobilization Project. Our
   results support both of our hypotheses.},

Abstract = {Our knowledge of the institutional features of local government in
   Canadian cities is surprisingly fragmentary. The academic literature has
   long identified dominant tendencies in Canadian local institutions, but
   systematic empirical data has been missing. In this article, we address
   this gap in knowledge in two ways. We introduce the Canadian Municipal
   Attributes Portal (CMAP), a new open-access database that contains
   information on dozens of institutional features of local government for
   nearly 100 of the most populous municipalities in Canada. We then
   propose a new multidimensional index of authority concentration, which
   is designed to capture variation in the local structure of
   decision-making authority in a systematic and nuanced manner. We apply
   this index to a systematic pan-Canadian subsample of 65 CMAP
   municipalities. The result is a rich portrait of institutional variety,
   one that both corroborates and substantially extends our current
   understanding of the shape of municipal institutions in Canadian cities.
   Notre connaissance des caracteristiques institutionnelles des
   collectivites locales dans les villes canadiennes est etonnamment
   fragmentaire. Les publications universitaires identifient depuis
   longtemps les tendances dominantes des institutions locales canadiennes,
   mais les donnees empiriques systematiques font defaut. Dans le present
   article, nous comblons cette lacune de deux manieres. Nous presentons le
   Portail canadien des attributs municipaux (PCAM), une nouvelle base de
   donnees en libre acces qui contient des informations sur des dizaines de
   caracteristiques institutionnelles des collectivites locales pour une
   centaine des municipalites les plus peuplees du Canada. Nous proposons
   ensuite un nouvel indice multidimensionnel de concentration de
   l'autorite, concu pour saisir de maniere systematique et nuancee les
   variations dans la structure locale du pouvoir decisionnel. Nous
   appliquons cet indice a un sous-echantillon pancanadien systematique de
   65 municipalites du PCAM. Il en resulte un riche portrait de la variete
   institutionnelle, qui corrobore et elargit considerablement notre
   comprehension actuelle de la forme des institutions municipales dans les
   villes canadiennes.},

Abstract = {How does public opinion affect political discourse on issues that
   parties struggle to deal with? Although scholars tend to analyse
   party-voter linkages in terms of policy positions, parties can respond
   to public opinion by changing both the positions and the salience of
   their policy agenda. Based on original time-series data of party
   discourse and voter preferences in France, Italy and the United Kingdom
   (1992-2016), this paper analyses how mainstream parties have changed
   their political discourse on European integration in response to an
   increasingly Eurosceptic public. Results show that mainstream parties
   have adapted their positions to changes in public opinion and have at
   the same time deemphasized European Union issues in their discourse as
   the public grew Eurosceptic. Parties did not talk more about Europe even
   when they followed the tides of public opinion. These findings challenge
   our current understanding of party responsiveness, have implications for
   theories of party competition, and contribute to debates on the
   legitimacy of the European project.},

Title = {Increased pressure lowered trust among unvaccinated during the COVID-19

Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, the imposition of moralistically justified
   costs on unvaccinated individuals was used to incentivize vaccination
   uptake. Here, we ask whether such a strategy creates adverse
   consequences in the form of lowered trust in the pandemic response among
   unvaccinated individuals, which could jeopardize their compliance with
   the broader set of health interventions. As our empirical case, we use a
   press conference held by the Danish government on 8 November 2021, where
   COVID-19-vaccination passports were reintroduced, in part, to pressure
   unvaccinated people to take up the vaccine. We analyse the effects of
   the press conference using daily, nationally representative survey data
   (total N = 24,934) employing a difference-in-differences design. We
   demonstrate that the press conference decreased the trust in the
   pandemic management by 11 percentage points among unvaccinated
   individuals, while trust remained high among vaccinated individuals.
   Moralistic cost imposition also reduced collective action motivation and
   coping appraisal among unvaccinated individuals, and, while it increased
   societal threat appraisal among vaccinated people, it failed to do so
   among unvaccinated individuals. Our findings imply that decision-makers
   using moralized cost imposition as a health intervention should be aware
   of its potential unintended adverse consequences.},

Abstract = {Simulations are increasingly prominent in classrooms, and research shows
   that such activities provide an array of benefits. In general,
   simulations tend to situate students as ``lab rats{''} (Asal 2005) who
   get to discuss the experiment. We call for bringing students into a
   simulation not as lab rats but instead as ``mad scientists.{''} We
   specifically propose using a simulation's debriefing step as an
   opportunity for students to imagine how they might revise the simulation
   that they experienced and to defend their revisions using concepts from
   class. We argue that such student-led revisions cultivate agentic
   engagement, a form of engagement in which students recognize themselves
   as co-constructors of knowledge with and for their peers. To test this
   notion, we modified the ``Isle of Ted{''} with an expanded
   post-simulation debriefing. We found that our approach cultivated
   student engagement and buy-in, required students to think of concepts
   dynamically, and was relatively simple to implement. Our study
   contributes to the literature on simulations as effective and engaging
   classroom tools, and it also emphasizes the potential for simulations to
   spark agentic learning.},

Abstract = {Little and Meng (L\&M) (2023) question the prevailing narrative of
   widespread democratic backsliding by showing that various objective
   indicators of democracy are flat over time. However, because recent
   democratic decline is concentrated in democracies, the objective
   indicators can accurately test for backsliding only if they can track
   democratic quality within democracies. This response article shows that
   they cannot, for conceptual and empirical reasons. The indicators
   generally can distinguish democracies from autocracies but are blind to
   variation in quality within democracies. L\&M, therefore, are showing
   that one form of variation in democracy is stagnant but are
   systematically missing the very type of variation that has most informed
   current warnings about backsliding.},

Abstract = {This article contributes a new layer to the existing analyses of
   Duterte's foreign policy by arguing that he epitomized a
   transactionalist approach to Philippine foreign policy. This approach
   favored bilateral to multilateral relations, focused on short-term wins
   rather than long-term foresight, adhered to a zero-sum worldview,
   rejected value-based policymaking, and did not follow a grand strategy.
   Most of these qualities have been apparent in Duterte's relationship
   with China, Russia, and the United States but became even more prominent
   during the COVID-19 crisis. The analysis revealed that Duterte's
   transactionalist foreign policy rhymed with his domestic politics, and
   his obsession with winning now resulted in contradictions in his foreign
   policy, indicating a lack of a grand strategy that informed his
   decision-making. This article contributes a real-world case of a
   transactionalist foreign policy while considering whether it would
   persist in future policymaking in the Philippines.},

Abstract = {This article is a study on the neoliberal state, its relation to time
   and its ongoing transformation through crisis. It is spurred by two
   seminal works - Hartog's on historicity and Rosa's on acceleration -
   that catalogue a collapse of the modern temporality defined by
   progression from past to future. The article develops this problematic
   by focusing on the state as a key organiser of social temporalities. As
   the state has, in the course of the 21st century, been occupied with
   fighting crises, the assessment of its transformation and its relation
   to time proceeds from an analysis of its crisis-response. It finds that
   the state cannot articulate a vision for the future. This is a
   historically unique development, and the article traces its causes and
   consequences. It argues that the loss of the future perspective results
   from neoliberalism's success in enhancing capital's power over society.
   This makes both capital and the state avert to change, even as crisis
   and disruption become systemic elements of the neoliberal order. This
   causes the neoliberal state to acquire the form of neoliberal despotism:
   a state whose purpose is to impose social stasis and, since it cannot
   lead towards an appealing future, can only govern through fear.},

   bureaucracy, as evidenced by public expenditure data. But less is known
   about the strategies that underlie these expenditures. The literature on
   influence-seeking points to two possibilities. Groups can lobby
   policymakers to persuade them to take a specific action, or groups can
   monitor policymakers, as in ``fire alarm{''} oversight, and report any
   unwanted action to Congress and other interested overseers. I exploit
   the fact that these two strategies have different implications for which
   policymakers will be targeted. Groups have an incentive to lobby their
   allies and persuadable would-be allies, and an incentive to monitor
   their adversaries. Using data on influence-seeking expenditures, I find
   that conservative groups disproportionately target their adversaries,
   which is consistent with monitoring, and that liberal groups
   disproportionately target their allies, which is consistent with
   lobbying. I discuss the implications for our understanding of democratic
   accountability in bureaucratic policymaking.},

Title = {INTERNET SHUTDOWN AS A THEORETICAL PROBLEM OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, OR WHAT
   WE DO (NOT) UNDERSTAND ABOUT NETWORK PROTEST MOBILIZATION},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Abstract = {. The influence of Internet communication on ``street{''} protest
   activity is the focus of this paper. In recent years, there has been
   some stagnation in this area of research: a shortage of breakthroughs
   that would indicate new research directions or at least significantly
   strengthen the empirical foundation of the already established
   hypotheses. The paradox is that when considering the impact of the
   global network on political behavior, the network aspect itself,
   reflecting the structural characteristics of information exchange,
   remains on the far periphery of the research field. In this work, we try
   to partially fill this gap by proposing a set of concepts that, on the
   one hand, are ``rooted{''} in network analysis, and on the other,
   reflect the important properties of the interaction of individuals
   within the framework of online and offline political mobilization. The
   simultaneous focus on the configuration of networks and the dynamics of
   participation also determines the approach to building such a theory -
   formal modeling. A key feature of the model's design is the
   identification of two structures in the overall communication system:
   core (strong offline ties) and augmented (core network plus online
   connections). The constructed model made it possible to strictly define
   the key concept - the network mobilization capacity, and to test the
   hypotheses built on basis. Computational experiments show that the ratio
   of mobilization capacities of core and augmented networks is a strong
   predictor of the effect of Internet shutdown. Although specific features
   of the structure dynamics of networks, such as the activation of
   ``broker{''} nodes, are of great importance, the paper also discusses
   the prospects for empirical operationalization of the concepts proposed
   by the author.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to study the military security trends on the
   `northern flank' of the confrontation between Russia and the collective
   West. The relevance of this work is due to the further expansion of NATO
   to the East, expressed in the accession of Finland and Sweden to the
   alliance and, accordingly, the creation of new threats. In the
   conditions of continuing high-intensity armed conflict in the middle of
   Europe, NATO's actions can be seen as part of the measures to impose
   costs on the Russian Federation and stretch the perimeter of its
   deterrence capabilities. The article also considers the problem of
   materialisation of perceived threats in the form of practical steps in
   the field of military development leading to an `escalation vortex', and
   suggests directions of possible negative consequences minimisation for
   national and international security because of NATO actions. For
   response measures, it is proposed to take into account the limited
   (primarily mobilisation and military-technical) resources (currently
   more crucial to fulfill the tasks of the Special Military Operation), as
   well as to limit escalation threats under the situation of intensive
   security dilemma implementation.},

Abstract = {This article joins a growing body of scholarship on political parties in
   arguing that democratic party politics should be concerned with avoiding
   the problem of factionalism. But existing responses to this problem have
   relied too heavily on conceptual distinctions between parties and
   factions. The dangers of factionalism cannot, in practice, be separated
   from the celebrated benefits of party politics. Both are rooted in the
   same aspects of social psychology. Consequently, I argue that we should
   understand the ideal of nonfactionalism as the management of a set of
   chronic and ineradicable concerns about how group conflict can undermine
   the specific forms of political unity appropriate for a liberal
   democracy. This ideal is negative, focused on avoiding pathological
   forms of party politics rather than conforming to a particular positive
   model. It is also plural, encompassing several related normative
   concerns. And it is systemic, assessed at the level of party systems.},

Abstract = {In his intellectual journey, Sheldon Wolin engaged with critical theory
   and Michel Foucault's reflections on the theory and practice of power.
   Wolin noted how postmodern theses focusing on the ubiquity of power in
   forms of domination and oppression, and the irreconcilability of
   differences, could pose a danger to democracy. According to Wolin,
   critical theory and Foucault's political philosophy underestimate the
   possibility of directing power towards the common good and the
   importance the past can have for the collective identity of the
   political body. This essay discusses Wolin's theses, drawing inspiration
   from Lucy Cane's book Sheldon Wolin and Democracy: Seeing through Loss
   (2020).},

Number = {1},
Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this work is to analyze the processes of
   construction of family expectations and their forms of manifestation in
   different educational profiles, as well as their role in the
   reproduction of social inequalities. METHOD: Seven semi-structured
   interviews were conducted with mothers and fathers, with and without
   higher education, who had children in the third or fourth year of
   secondary education (ESO). The aim of the interviews was to address the
   symbolic and subjective dimension of the participants' expectations.
   RESULTS: The findings show how the construction of expectations has a
   significant connection with the influences on trajectories and previous
   educational experiences of the people interviewed, as well as the
   characterization of their children (mediated by teachers' impressions)
   and the perceived opportunities and available resources. Practical
   manifestation was based on an integration of the school at home and vice
   versa, and have been essential for a school-family consonance in those
   profiles of higher education. The discursive manifestation was indirect
   and less necessary in this profile, since the children naturally assumed
   the aspiration of the university trajectory, while the secondary
   education profiles required more explicit strategies to manage those
   trajectories. DISCUSSION: The habitus and the different capitals
   (especially cultural capital) are essential elements in the constitution
   and transmission of family expectations, which have been shown to be
   decisive in the reproduction of social inequalities within the
   educational field.},

Abstract = {Responsible parties are conventionally defined as those capable of
   announcing their legislative goals and then passing them on the strength
   of their own members' votes. In this article, I consider why UK majority
   parties have closely approximated these conditions for responsibility
   since the 1880s, while US majority parties have never approximated them
   closely. I provide the first systematic evidence on when the British
   opposition began to offer across-the-board opposition to the
   government's agenda and when the government became able to pass bills
   using only its own members' votes. I also explore the role that leaders'
   control of the legislative agenda and their followers' nominations
   played in these developments. I attribute US parties' inability to mimic
   their British counterparts to different costs of defending bill passage
   coalitions against ``weakest-link{''} attacks.},

Abstract = {The aim of the contribution is to examine how eligible voters in the
   2020 parliamentary election perceive social justice in relation to the
   old-age pension system in the Slovak Republic. The sub-objective is to
   analyse possible significant differences in the perception of social
   justice among eligible voters in the 2020 parliamentary election in
   relation to the old-age pension system in terms of their political
   orientation. 701 respondents (349 women and 352 men) responded to
   questions asking about their political orientation as eligible voters in
   the parliamentary election in Slovakia in 2020 and the degree of
   perceived social justice in relation to the old-age pension system of
   the Slovak Republic. The results showed the fair distribution of
   deposits and returns is important for the respondents' perception of
   social justice in relation to the old-age pension system of the Slovak
   Republic. The analyses showed that respondents with different political
   orientations had different opinions on the extent to which the
   calculation of the old-age pension should depend on the amount of
   income.},

Abstract = {This study aims to identify how civil society reacts to the
   de-democratizing attempts and the political polarization that usually
   accompanies this process. Civil society actors working under populist
   rule usually have to overcome two main challenges: the government's
   attempt to attack and co-opt civil society, and political polarization,
   which limits their social embeddedness, a crucially important criterion
   for resistance and maintaining their independence. I will examine the
   Hungarian, Polish, and Israeli cases and show how civil society
   organizations respond to the changing political context and how these
   responses might interact with political polarization. In each case, the
   paper introduces the policies and main legislative framework, funding
   and political discourse concerning civil society, and the responses of a
   diverse set of organizations (human rights, environmental protection,
   and civil society development organizations along with right-wing or
   pro-government civil society organizations). The main time frame of the
   analysis is between 2010 and 2020 for Hungary and Israel, and 2015-2020
   for Poland, but in some accounts, I will also refer to developments
   between 2020 and 2023, using desk research and organizational
   interviews.},

Title = {Limited Congruence: Citizens' Attitudes and Party Rhetoric About
   Referendums and Deliberative Practices},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Both citizens and political parties refer to novel participatory
   practices in the contemporary crisis of representative democracy. Survey
   data indicates a growing demand for such practices within the
   electorate, while political parties have also begun discussing them more
   frequently. However, previous studies on citizens' attitudes and
   parties' discourse on democratic innovations rarely speak to each other.
   It remains unclear whether citizens' attitudes and parties' discourse
   are congruent. This article seeks to address this gap in the literature
   and analyses the extent to which political parties reflect citizens'
   attitudes towards referendums and citizens' deliberation in their
   manifestos. We cover 15 political parties in Germany and the UK. Our
   analysis uses party manifesto data between 2010 and 2024, and data from
   surveys conducted on national representative samples. Our findings
   reveal that political parties and citizens rarely have congruent
   approaches towards referendums and deliberative practices. People's
   enthusiasm about referendums is hardly reflected in parties' rhetoric,
   but the latter reacts gradually to the public appetite for deliberation.
   There are visible differences between opposition parties and those in
   government.},

Abstract = {In Russia, the people's ``historical consciousness{''} and ``collective
   memory{''} are shaped by the state. Television, the most powerful
   propaganda machine, and schools reproduce the central elements of Soviet
   ideology and an authoritarian understanding of the state. The pivotal
   point of state history policy is the victory in the Great Patriotic War.
   It serves to propagate the idea of the necessary unity of vlast' i narod
   (the leadership and the people) as a prerequisite for the nation's
   survival and to justify the war of aggression against Ukraine. The
   critical reappraisal of Stalinism is on the defensive, the repressions
   and the Great Terror are being displaced in the population's collective
   consciousness. The positive assessment of how the Germans dealt with the
   crimes of National Socialism is fading. It is being overshadowed by the
   idea that Germany is once again a hostile state that supports Ukraine.},

Title = {WHY DOES NOT THE U.S. ATTACK CHINA? THE FOG OF THE FUTURE AND HISTORIC
   OPTIMISM IN POLICIES OF GREAT POWERS},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {62-94},
Abstract = {The rise of China constitutes a challenge for the U.S. hegemonic
   aspirations. However, Washington reacts to it rather belatedly and with
   restrain. Up until the mid-2020s, the United States did not consider the
   preventive use of force as a means to deter its competitor. On the
   contrary, it maintained intensive economic ties with China, contributing
   to its further strengthening. The article argues that the U.S. policy
   towards China reflects the optimism within the U.S. leadership regarding
   the long-term preservation of the foundations of its international
   standing. In other words, the United States does not perceive itself a
   declining power; rather, it believes that China will not be able to
   compete with it in the forceable future. In this regard, the U.S. has
   pursued primarily a delaying strategy, combining restrained pressure
   with unwillingness to either escalate or make significant concessions.
   The U.S. optimism proceeds from the prevailing uncertainty in
   international relations about the relative balance of power among great
   powers and the unclear prospects of future shifts in national
   capabilities. Under these conditions, Washington relies on ideological
   convictions in the superiority of its political, economic and social
   model over its competitors and appeals to the past patterns of great
   power rivalry. This study covers the period from the late 2000s to the
   mid-2020s. The article begins with a theoretical justification of the
   origins of optimism of weakening powers. Then, it examines changes in
   balance of power between the U.S. and China based on traditional
   indicators of national capabilities. Following this, the article
   explores the arguments against the U.S. decline and summarizes official
   assessments of threats to U.S. global standing. Finally, it traces the
   comparative roles of accommodation, coercion and restraint in the U.S.
   policy towards China. The analysis envisages an adjustment in the
   conceptual understanding of the dynamics of great power rivalry. It
   demonstrates that the lack of reliable information does not necessarily
   lead to intensifications of rivalries (as suggested by the ``security
   dilemma{''}), but can also limit confrontation.},

Abstract = {This study examines how an endogenous change in political trust affects
   the performance of a representative democracy. To this end, we construct
   a two-period political agency model in which voters face uncertainty
   about the distribution of politicians' types (trust uncertainty) as well
   as each individual politician's type. Such trust uncertainty allows
   political trust to endogenously change over time. In its presence, the
   incumbent's action has a spillover effect on the challenger's value
   through changes in political trust. We show that because of this
   mechanism, trust uncertainty weakens electoral accountability.
   Furthermore, it generates multiple self-fulfilling equilibria: a
   high-accountability and a low-accountability equilibrium coexist. In
   countries briefly experiencing democracy, trust uncertainty is severe.
   Our results indicate that democratic performance tends to be low and
   even similar countries can experience different performance levels in
   such new democracies.},

Title = {The ``Magic{''} Number: Women's Critical Mass and Substantive
   Representation in Angola},
Journal = {SIYASAL-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {This study explores whether and how a critical mass of women in
   parliament, after years of underrepresentation, translates into
   substantive representation of women (SRW). Critical mass in politics
   refers to a threshold number necessary to effect change in legislative
   contexts. It is rooted in the assumed causal relationship between two
   forms of representation-descriptive and substantive-implying that SRW
   depends on active political engagement. This paper offers a nuanced
   perspective by deconstructing SRW into a process and an outcome, and it
   suggests four potential scenarios that connect critical mass to SRW.
   Through a comparative within-case analysis of Angola, a country that
   witnessed the emergence of a critical mass of women through the adoption
   of gender quotas after a prolonged period of underrepresentation, this
   study reveals that SRW can manifest in multiple forms. This study
   challenges the assumption of a direct link between SRW and descriptive
   representation of women (DRW) by demonstrating that the impact of DRW on
   SRW is multiple and can proceed independently as both a process and an
   outcome. Ultimately, this paper underscores the need for a more
   comprehensive understanding of SRW in diverse political contexts.},

Title = {Chinese Multinationals and Europe's Geoeconomic Turn: The
   De-Globalization of the Chinese ICT and Automotive Industry?},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Amid increasing geopolitical tensions between Western powers and China
   over the alleged state-capitalist nature of Chinese corporate
   internationalization, European governments have introduced a set of
   political measures tightening their trade and investment regimes on
   grounds of national security and economic competitiveness. This article
   analyzes how this ``geoeconomic turn{''} in Europe affected the
   internationalization of (state-backed) Chinese firms into Europe and
   hence the establishment of Sino-European corporate relations. With a
   focus on the Chinese ICT and automotive industries, we zoom in on
   corporate internationalization by distinguishing two modes: (a) outward
   foreign direct investments (greenfield investments and mergers and
   acquisitions) and (b) the formation of collaborative ties (strategic
   alliances and joint ventures) with European companies-a hitherto
   underexplored form of Sino-European corporate relations. Our analysis is
   predicated on a comprehensive dataset consolidating information on both
   modes of internationalization for the period 2000-2023. We show that, in
   relation to investment numbers, Chinese companies continue to expand
   into Europe, even if values are decreasing. We also find that the
   formation of collaborative ties (strategic alliances and joint ventures)
   has not halted but increased in the wake of Europe's geoeconomic turn,
   indicating a further intensification of Sino-European corporate
   relations, though under the radar of tightening investment policies and
   mechanisms. When unpacking the variegated impact of the geoeconomic turn
   on Chinese companies' internationalization strategies in Europe, our
   study also finds, however, that its ramifications vary substantively-not
   only per sector but also among companies exposed to varying degrees of
   party-state permeation. Applying a novel fine-grained measure to
   party-state permeation, the article shows that the geoeconomic turn
   seems to have affected predominantly those leading Chinese firms with a
   high party-state exposure.},

Abstract = {How can contemporary democracies be `internationally ordered' in ways
   that combine their interconnectedness with a form of internal autonomy
   where their citizens are free, equal and effective in using their
   democracies to accord one another rights and obligations, and control
   their own laws? I use two justifications for political authority to
   consider that question. The one, associated with David Hume, suggests an
   instrumental justification for political authority as a means of
   providing essential collective goods. The other, associated with
   Immanuel Kant, holds political authority to be justified by rights and
   duties. I use the two to suggest where the Union can be of service to
   member democracies in reconciling their interconnectedness with their
   autonomy.},

Abstract = {Georgia is at a historic crossroads. For years, the government led the
   country towards the European Union. Now, it has made a U-turn, but
   hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets to protest. The conflict
   has been put on hold for the time being and will be settled at the
   ballot box in October. Experience from previous years has shown that the
   ruling party conducts election campaign by unfair means. The electoral
   law, which benefited large parties and helped to consolidate the power
   of ruling parties, has been changed. But the familiar methods of
   influencing elections can be expected. They range from the use of
   administrative resources to open violence.},

   (1991) and during the ``polycrisis{''} with Pierre Moscovici
   (2015-2019). They compare notes on access to fieldwork and research
   conditions and highlight similarities and differences that have marked
   the history of French-led Commission cabinets with regards to the
   sociology of members, the role of politics, insertion in the Brussels
   bubble, and relations with capitals.},

Abstract = {Since 1994 the South African government's commitment to peace and
   security in Africa inexorably drew the South African National Defence
   Force (SANDF) into extensive involvement in multinational peacekeeping
   operations. These external operations clearly aligned the South African
   government with its articulated objectives concerning the pursuit of
   peace on the African continent and its (moral) intention and
   responsibility to act in a leading role on the continent. However, a
   dwindling defence budget and the burden of a high-tech force design
   increasingly impacted negatively on the SANDF to maintain and develop a
   sustainable capability geared for regional external operations. Yet, in
   the domestic context the government also increasingly expected the SANDF
   to render support to the SAPS as murder and death rates are comparable
   and, in some instances, even higher than death rates in high-intensity
   war zones in the international community. This simply means that the
   SANDF has the almost impossible task of balancing its demanding regional
   deployments with ongoing appeals by politicians and elements of the
   public for the SANDF to be of assistance in hotspots of high levels of
   criminality where the SAPS is unable to protect South Africans in
   accordance with the requirements of the Constitution. In the final
   analysis, the article concludes that there is a mismatch between what
   has been expected of the SANDF in the past three decades from its
   political masters on the one side, and its budget and related
   capabilities on the other.},

Title = {National security in Cuba. Neo-corporativist interests, in a changing
   and political confrontation scenarios},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Along with the economic crisis known as ``the special period{''} and the
   end of the ideological bipolarity, the Cuban government centered its
   objectives on economic recovery, an activity that was mainly managed by
   the military with a neocorporatist logic. Our hypothesis is that, in a
   context of political transition (Fidel Castro's death and Raul Castro's
   retirement), the behavior of Gaesa, the economic arm of the Cuban Armed
   Forces, combines principles bequeathed by populist militarism and
   neocorporatist practices. Through this, the ruling elite molds Cuban
   national security with the justifying end of defending the country,
   while it prioritizes particular interests over the general interest.
   This situation generates consequently an amplification of repression on
   the basis of legal recourses such as the Law -Decrees 370/2018 and
   349/2018. In this way, we show that national security is trapped in a
   set of sui generis tensions, where citizen's rights are limited by
   restrictive and exceptional policies typical of populist militarism, an
   example of the traditional Cuban security doctrine that is amplified
   through the political and economic power of Gaesa.},

Title = {Oaths that (un)Bind: Recovering the Furies' Political Voice in
   Aeschylus's Oresteia},
Journal = {POLITY},

Abstract = {Aeschylus's Oresteia has typically been read as a narrative depicting
   the triumph of a law-bound democratic civic order over an unruly system
   of private vengeance. Feminist readers of the tragedy have shown that
   this triumph is simultaneously that of patriarchy over matriarchy. This
   article deepens existing feminist interpretations of the tragedy by
   centering the mythical Furies' relationship to the practice of swearing
   and keeping oaths in ancient Greece. I examine the oath as a rhetorical
   practice by which Athenian women seek inclusion into patriarchal scripts
   of credibility and authority. Exploring the tragedy's depiction of oaths
   alongside its treatments of justice and gender, I excavate the Furies'
   attempts at having a matricide register as a political, rather than a
   private, injustice. Women's claims to justice in the tragedy fail to be
   heard politically, I argue, in parallel with the tragedy's progressive
   delegitimization of oaths unbound from the juridical sphere. I show how
   oaths have two important political functions. First, they reveal the
   presence or absence of relations of trust such that these relations may
   become objects of contention. Second, they make gendered injustices like
   matricide legible as political betrayals that have both personal and
   public dimensions. Attending to these functions of the oath in the
   Oresteia, I suggest, enables readers to detect seeds of resistance in
   the Furies, whose recovered political voice sheds light upon the
   discursive conditions in which women are heard as authoritative and
   credible speakers, or not, in contemporary democratic societies.},

Title = {The Unpolitics of Brexit},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {This article is an attempt to present, develop, and deploy the use of
   the concept of ``unpolitics{''} in relation to Brexit. The article
   starts with an outline of the concept of unpolitics and then turns to
   its application to Brexit. The argument is that in the politics of
   Brexit, specifically in the appeal of part of the ``leave{''} campaign
   and in the behaviour and appeal of Johnson, we can identify unpolitics
   as playing a significant role. For the ``Vote Leave,{''} we can identify
   unpolitical tropes as explicit elements of the campaign. Also, during
   Johnson's premiership and his campaign in the 2019 general election, the
   appeal and behaviour exhibited elements of unpolitics. Johnson's
   political demise was not due to Brexit, Covid-19, or Putin but
   represented the playing out of his unpolitics.},

Abstract = {Under President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, Uzbekistan has taken on a cautious

   China is benefiting from this. Trade volume and Chinese direct

   in the country's education sector. In the fight against poverty,
   Tashkent has oriented itself toward the Chinese model. Close cooperation
   has even developed in the sensitive areas of internal and external
   security. But the political elites are strangers to one another. The
   Uzbek leadership is trying to avoid becoming too dependent on China.},

Title = {Null effects of social media ads on voter registration: Three digital
   field experiments},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Civic organisations and progressive campaigns regard digital advertising
   as an essential method to register to vote low-participation groups,
   such as ethnic minorities, young voters and frequent home movers like
   private-sector tenants. Digital strategies appear to be promising in
   countries like the UK, where the registration process can be completed
   online, usually in less than 5 minutes, using a web link in the advert.
   But are typical digital campaigns effective in registering voters? To
   find out, we provide evidence from three randomised controlled trials:
   two conducted with advocacy organisations and the third run by the
   research team, carried out in two types of UK elections (general and
   local) and assigned either at the aggregate (Study 1 and Study 2) or
   individual (Study 3) level. Despite wide reach and relatively high rates
   of engagement, we find that the digital ad campaigns trialed across
   three studies did not affect under-registered groups' voter
   registrations. These null findings raise questions about commonly-used
   digital advertising strategies to register marginalised groups. They are
   consistent with other studies that report either null or minimal effects
   of digital ads on other types of political behaviour.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to assess the impact of revolving doors on the
   development of public policy. Taking the post-2008 financial
   transactions' transparency reform as a case study, it is investigating
   potential links between the career paths of the public officials
   involved and the outcome of their legislative work. It is based on
   tracing a specific legislative procedure including through notes of
   meetings between public officials and interest representatives, on a
   biographical data base of involved agents and on interviews with some of
   them.},

Abstract = {Difficult and controversial, with setbacks, the process of reintegration
   of the CIS countries is largely failing in the humanitarian sphere.
   Humanitarian communications in the field of education, science, culture,
   art, etc. have long remained on the periphery of the attention of
   political elites of the new independent states, or the elites even
   deliberately hampered them. Only in recent years, due to the revealed
   high conflict potential of the factor of value-based orientation of the
   population ({''}identity wars{''}) and the increasing incidence of
   cultural clashes, this component of integration started to be included
   in the Russian political discourse. The article is devoted to the study
   of professional communications between experts in the field of
   humanities from six CIS countries: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus,
   Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia. The study is based on the expert
   survey conducted jointly by the International Non-Profit Association of
   Research Companies ``Eurasian Monitor{''} and MGIMO University. Based on
   the experts' responses, the Communication Orientation Index (COI) was
   designed, which allowed to identify priority geopolitical vectors of
   interaction for the countries under consideration. According to the COI
   values, some of the CIS countries included in the analysis have similar
   communication profiles. Russia and Belarus demonstrate a high degree of
   self-orientation (however, Belarus also shows orientation toward
   Russia). Armenia and Azerbaijan are more oriented toward the EU and
   North America. Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan are located between these two
   poles. Among the factors influencing the COI values, the authors
   emphasize the role of the financial factor. According to their
   conclusion, the creation of funds like Russian Science Foundation,
   designed to finance international research projects and activities in
   the Northern Eurasian region, is one of the most important conditions
   for developing professional communication between specialists in the
   field of humanities in CIS countries.},

Title = {Predictors of terrorist use of suicide attacks: group age and state
   power},
Journal = {DYNAMICS OF ASYMMETRIC CONFLICT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 22},
Abstract = {This study investigates the question of why terrorist groups differ in
   how frequently they conduct suicide attacks. The study provides a novel
   explanation for the tactical choices of terrorist groups, demonstrating
   the key roles of group age, initial adoption of suicide attacks, and
   state military strength. The effect of these factors is tested through a
   quantitative analysis of a dataset assembled from multiple
   publicly-available datasets. The constructed dataset includes 140
   terrorist groups active between 1998 and 2012. The analysis finds that
   as groups increase in age, they conduct fewer suicide attacks, as they
   are more likely to possess skilled operatives and have the capacity to
   carry out complex operations. The results also show that groups that
   adopted suicide terror as a tactic later in their existence carry out
   fewer suicide attacks, due to organizations relying on established
   practices and procedures. In addition, as state troop levels increase,
   the frequency of suicide attacks rises, likely as a response to
   increased security pressure and target hardening. The implications of
   these findings for counter-terrorism policy include the need for
   heightened security measures against suicide attacks by emerging groups
   and preparing for potential increases in suicide attacks as state
   military pressure intensifies.},

Abstract = {T his article presents a new theory of majoritarian domination drawn
   from Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar's critique of majoritarian tyranny during
   the decades preceding British India's decolonization. Ambedkar's
   critique of British colonial pluralism and Congress-led Indian
   anticolonialism emphasizes attention to social structures and the
   mechanisms that produce and sustain communal majorities. He argues that
   caste prevents equality and fraternity, thus foreclosing the possibility
   of a democratic society. In such a context, Ambedkar argues that the
   majority is likely to be communal and fixed, rather than political,
   inclusive, and open to change over time. Ambedkarian majoritarian
   domination supplements nineteenth-century accounts of the institutional
   and epistemic dimensions of majoritarian tyranny. I defend comparison as
   a tool for theoretical analysis to show that Ambedkarian majoritarian
   domination can explain the interaction of hierarchical social structures
   with democratic politics in contexts beyond colonial India.},

Abstract = {The European Parliament is often presented as a success story regarding
   women's representation. Yet, recent studies observe gendered patterns in
   parliamentary behaviour. This article contributes to this scholarship by
   studying gender differences in MEPs' parliamentary behaviour on
   `masculine' and `feminine' policy domains. Analysing 136,787
   parliamentary questions over 25 years (1994-2019), the study reveals
   moderate gender differences in MEPs' behaviour. Moreover, gender
   differences are influenced by seniority and women's numerical presence
   in the European Parliament's political groups. Gender-stereotypical
   policy foci are more pronounced among newcomers and disappear for
   experienced MEPs. In political groups with fewer women, seniority is key
   for women MEPs seeking engagement in masculine policy domains. Overall,
   our findings underscore the interplay between gender, seniority, and
   women's presence in shaping MEPs' parliamentary behaviour within the
   European Parliament's gendered context.},

Abstract = {Authoritarian elites may play an essential role in transitioning
   democracies, but little is known about the fate of these elites beyond
   that of the top leaders. This article offers the first panel-data study
   of authoritarian elites in a transitional democracy. We focus on Spain,
   a paradigmatic case of successful democratization from above, and rely
   on an original dataset to measure quantitatively the professional
   careers of more than 600 members of the Francoist elites in Spain. We
   have measured the relative importance of each job that members of
   Francoist elites had before and after the democratization process,
   gathering information on more than 5,400 jobs over 50 years. Our results
   suggest a positive relationship between the individual's position during
   the dictatorship and the democracy. While there was a change in the
   importance of Francoist political elites after the transition, economic
   elites were barely affected by the transition to democracy. For that
   reason, natural death and retirement were the most common reasons behind
   their disappearance from the spheres of power.},

Abstract = {Why do authoritarian regimes maintain access to open U.S.-owned social
   media platforms like Twitter and how do pro-government supporters use
   them? While the literature on consultative authoritarianism explains how
   limited public engagement through purpose-built input institutions can
   be used to gauge public grievances and boost regime legitimacy, we know
   less about the implications of open social media applications and why
   the regime maintains access to them despite their subversive potential.
   This article argues that open platforms allow pro-government supporters
   to perform public opinion and police views that do not align with
   official state talking points, creating an impression of a consensus
   about what society ``thinks.{''} Yet, they might push the government to
   respond to their demands that might not align with official state
   interests. I label this practice of enlisting supporters and segments of
   society for political control collaborative authoritarianism. This
   practice extends to purpose-built law enforcement apps, engaging broader
   segments of the population. Introducing the case of Twitter use in Saudi
   Arabia, this article draws on around 100 interviews that I conducted
   with patriotic and nationalist journalists, intellectuals, and Twitter
   influencers across Saudi Arabia between November 2021 and May 2022. The
   article provides novel insights into the grassroots politics of digital
   authoritarianism as well as the mobilization of illiberal movements
   beyond Saudi Arabia.},

Title = {Representation at Risk: Evaluating Levels and Consequences of Violence
   against Immigrant-Background Politicians},

Abstract = {Politicians are increasingly subjected to violence, both online and
   offline. Recent studies highlight a gendered pattern to this violence.
   But, as societies diversify and minorities increasingly hold political
   office, we have yet to assess whether members of these groups face
   disproportionate levels of violence. Our research investigates levels
   and types of violence against immigrant background politicians in
   Sweden, where over one-third is either foreign-born or has a
   foreign-born parent, using a unique three-wave survey (N 1 / 4 23,000)
   on Swedish elected officials. Across every form of violence examined,
   politicians with immigrant backgrounds report experiencing significantly
   more physical and psychological violence than their counterparts. These
   experiences are not without political consequence: immigrant background
   politicians, and among them especially women, are significantly more
   likely than their counterparts to consider exiting politics due to
   harassment. Together, these findings suggest that violence may be
   driving this already underrepresented group of immigrant background
   politicians out of office.},

Abstract = {Politicians frequently face toxic behaviors. We argue that these
   behaviors impose a double burden on women, who may not only face higher
   exposure to toxicity, but experience attacks that they and others
   understand to be motivated by prejudice and designed to push them out of
   office. Using large-scale image-based conjoint experiments in the United
   States, Denmark, Belgium, and Chile, we demonstrate that both
   politicians themselves and citizens regard messages targeting women
   politicians as more toxic than otherwise equivalent messages targeting
   men. This perception intensifies when messages mention gender or come
   from perpetrators who are men. A second experiment to investigate the
   mechanisms shows that hostile behaviors toward women are more frequently
   understood as driven by prejudice and attempts to remove women from
   politics. These findings highlight the importance of understanding how
   perceptions of perpetrators' motives affect the severity of political
   toxicity, and provide insights into the gendered effects of political
   hostility.},

Abstract = {The implications of rising parliamentary representation of populist
   parties have been thoroughly studied but little is known about the
   impact of populist state leaders on party positions. In this article, we
   study mainstream parties' strategic responses when a populist takes over
   as the leader of a nation. We use content-analytical data and large
   language modelling to measure positions expressed in manifestos from
   parties from 51 democracies between 1989 and 2018. Employing methods for
   causal inference from observational data, we find that right-wing
   populist state leaders induce mainstream parties to differentiate their
   positions on multiculturalism, possibly leading to polarization of the
   party system. Under left-wing populist leaders, mainstream parties adopt
   more homogenous or differentiated positions, depending on the policy
   category and other contextual factors. Parties are generally more
   responsive in emerging than advanced countries and in presidential than
   parliamentary systems.},

Title = {National eco-social policies in the framework of EU just transition: The
   cases of Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain},

Abstract = {This article examines two questions. First, how far have the green and
   social policy objectives of the European Green Deal and the Recovery and
   Resilience Facility (RRF) been translated into `eco-social policies'
   (i.e. demonstrate a `socio-ecological' dimension) in the National
   Recovery and Resilience Plans (NRRPs) of four of the biggest beneficiary
   countries, namely, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain? And, second, how
   is the role of national welfare states articulated in these eco-social
   policies to support this just green transition? Our analysis shows
   first, that, although the analysed NRRPs have a socio-ecological
   dimension, this is very limited in terms of the share of `eco-social'
   measures in the total number of policy measures in the NRRPs. Moreover,
   we find that the role of national welfare states in the identified
   eco-social policies of the NRRPs in the four country-cases we examine is
   significantly tilted in favour of what we call `benchmarking' and
   `enabling' functions, in contrast to what we call `buffering' and
   `consensus-building' functions. In that sense, the socio-ecological
   dimension of these national plans seems `unbalanced' in terms of the
   functions that national welfare states play in it. The article concludes
   with some reflections on the implications of these findings for the role
   of EU policy legacies and frameworks and of national welfare states in
   shaping the emergence of eco-social policies as means to a just green
   transition and on some methodological challenges for the study of
   eco-social policies in the context of the European Green Deal and its
   implementation.},

Abstract = {The relationship between Mexico and human rights treaty bodies has been
   paradigmatic due to the adoption of a foreign policy based on an
   openness to international scrutiny that is not reflected in the internal
   situation of human rights. An example of this contradiction is the case
   of the rights of migrants in Mexico. The objective of this article is to
   analyze the effects of mechanisms of the United Nations System of Human
   Rights, specifically the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of
   All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families in Mexico, to
   determine the scope of the impact of civil society on the guarantee of
   human rights of migrants despite the lack of international consensus
   regarding the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights
   of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.

Abstract = {Scholarship investigating autocrats' motivations to adopt gender
   equality reforms has proliferated. Yet, many questions remain
   unanswered: Who supports these gender reforms? Do citizens support
   gender quota policies? What is the role of political elites? Under what
   conditions do women's increased presence in politics lead to positive
   outcomes for women? Answering these questions is crucial for both
   practical and empirical reasons. On the one hand, the number of `partly
   free' and `not free' countries is increasing, making up the majority of
   world countries (79\%). On the other hand, women's access to political
   power has exponentially grown over the past two decades. Women in
   autocracies are participating in politics more than ever before. This
   special issue presents cutting-edge research on gender and authoritarian
   politics relying on diverse methodological approaches and geographical
   foci. The introduction of this SI identifies the remaining knowledge
   gaps and provides future directions for more scholarship on the
   intersection of gender and authoritarian politics.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},

Abstract = {The 1997 UK General Election preceded 13 years of New Labour government.
   It would be a further 14 years until the Labour Party next held office.
   Following the initial disavowal of New Labour by many in the wake of the
   2010 General Election, these 14 years saw the emergence of a positive
   narrative regarding New Labour and its time in office - in addition to
   the reestablishment of what can be seen as `New Labour people'
   reproducing this narrative - in the mainstream of British political
   life. In this paper, we use the concept of political myth to explore the
   persistence of the ideas, strategy, and personnel of New Labour. We
   begin by defining the concept of political myth in greater detail,
   drawing out its key features as outlined in the existing literature. We
   then introduce the case of New Labour, giving an account of the
   emergence of what we term the New Labour Myth. We then demonstrate how
   this case falls under the concept of political myth using evidence drawn
   from a variety of sources across the post-2010 period. Taken together,
   we argue that the New Labour Myth constitutes an important strain of
   thought in contemporary British politics.},

Abstract = {Patron-client relationship depends on the evolving international
   situation. Russia's war in Ukraine has weakened Russia's ability to
   support client economically, in addition, Russia's reputation as has
   patron suffered. In this situation, the Eurasian de facto states that
   have Russia as their patron, have reacted differently: Abkhazia and
   South Ossetia have made moves to huddle more closely together with their
   patron. Transnistria has signaled willingness to distance themselves
   from Russia, by allowing grain to be exported from Ukraine over their
   territory to Romania. The article examines the causes behind the changed
   vectors of de facto state orientation vis-\& agrave;-vis the patron.},

Abstract = {Since their inception, security institutions in Mexico have undergone
   significant transformations in their structure, organization, and
   responsibilities, which has influenced their role in ensuring public
   safety in the country. The configuration of the institution responsible
   for providing security in Mexico under military leadership not only
   deviates from the constitutional precepts to which it should adhere but
   also undermines the legal security of citizens regarding the enjoyment
   and full exercise of their human rights, due to acts prone to rights
   violations by such corporations, especially in the absence of a social
   proximity formation. This article focuses on the international
   perspective of human rights organizations about the security
   institutions in Mexico, considering the jurisprudence, recommendation,
   and cases in the Inter-American Human Rights System. Multiple
   international organizations conclude that these security institutions
   have indicated a regression in human rights and require oversight by a
   regional international entity to ensure compliance with recommendations
   and the guarantee of a rule of law.

   Desde su creaci \& oacute;n, las instituciones de seguridad en M \&
   eacute;xico han experimentado transformaciones significativas en su
   estructura, organizaci \& oacute;n y responsabilidades, lo que ha
   influido en su papel para garantizar la seguridad p \& uacute;blica en
   el pa \& iacute;s. La configuraci \& oacute;n de la instituci \&
   oacute;n encargada de brindar seguridad en M \& eacute;xico bajo el
   liderazgo militar no s \& oacute;lo se aparta de los preceptos
   constitucionales a los que debe sujetarse, sino que adem \& aacute;s
   atenta contra la seguridad jur \& iacute;dica de los ciudadanos respecto
   del goce y ejercicio pleno de sus derechos humanos, debido a actos
   proclives a violaciones de derechos por parte de dichas corporaciones,
   sobre todo en ausencia de una formaci \& oacute;n de proximidad social.
   Este art \& iacute;culo se centra en la perspectiva internacional de las
   organizaciones de derechos humanos sobre las instituciones de seguridad
   en M \& eacute;xico, considerando la jurisprudencia, recomendaciones y
   casos en el Sistema Interamericano de Derechos Humanos. M \&
   uacute;ltiples organismos internacionales concluyen que estas
   instituciones de seguridad han mostrado un retroceso en materia de
   derechos humanos y requieren de la supervisi \& oacute;n de un ente
   internacional regional para asegurar el cumplimiento de las
   recomendaciones y la garant \& iacute;a de un Estado de derecho.},
