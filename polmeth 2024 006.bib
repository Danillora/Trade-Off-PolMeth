Abstract = {Grace Tame's 2021 Australian of the Year (AOTY) award directed public
   attention towards sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), as did
   Australia Day award recipients Donna Carson in 2004 and Rosie Battie in
   2015. We use mixed-method textual analysis of a corpus of prime
   minister's Australia Day speeches between 1990 and 2021 to show how
   conservative Liberal Party prime ministers have narrated a discourse of
   idealised national identity to manage activist demands regarding SGBV
   policy. We quantitatively find that prime ministers promote masculine
   and heteronormative representations of Australian identity and then
   develop a qualitative typology of conservative SGBV frames employed by
   prime ministers that gloss over SGBV as a pressing and chronic policy
   issue and position idealised Australian femininity to condone and
   obscure SGBV. This paper builds upon scholarship on public policy and
   gendered nationalism to explain this pattern of SGBV problem definition
   and framing by conservative prime ministers.},

Abstract = {Using an original 2021 survey of mayors in U.S. mayors in cities of
   10,000 in population and above, we explore the individual costs of
   psychological and physical violence. These costs include emotional
   distress, diverted attention from the job, and considerations about
   leaving the job. Overall, we find that 95 percent of mayors faced
   violence in office. Among those who did, the more violence reported, the
   more likely they were to have faced such costs. Further, those mayors
   (mostly women) who faced sexualized violence were more likely to have
   reported those effects. All told, violence against officeholders has
   individual effects as well as systemic ones. If violence keeps mayors
   from being able to do their job fully or causes them to leave it, the
   political costs may be quite grave in terms of losing experienced
   representatives-and it may also have disparate effects on particular
   groups of officeholders, such as women.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the trajectories of secularization,
   de-secularization and re-secularization in Bangladesh. It is about
   mapping broad historical developments with reference to basic
   understanding of secularization and its progress in Bangladesh. The
   central question in the article is: How have the trajectories of
   secularization, de-secularization and re-secularization in Bangladesh
   been influenced by the nexus of internal-external dynamics of political
   and social forces developed in the 1980s? The article argues that a
   decisive attempt to rediscover liberal and secular character of politics
   is currently evident in Bangladesh. The attempt to reestablish
   secularism in the society also faces a host of challenges, stemming from
   national, regional and global contexts that echo the 1980s.
   Methodologically, it is based on policy outlook and trend analysis.},

Abstract = {Informal negotiations have become the norm in the European Union
   legislative process. Yet, researchers are divided over the effects of
   this change on the European Commission's ability to defend the content
   of its proposals from modifications by the co-legislators. This article
   addresses this puzzle by using a fine-grained measure of whether
   informal negotiations took place which includes trivial agreements,
   namely legislation adopted in first reading because the co-legislators
   agree on the content, as a specific category. The results suggest that
   informal negotiations do not lead to more changes to the Commission's
   proposals than the formal process. This calls for a better consideration
   of trivial agreements in studies of the European Union legislative
   process.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {58},
Number = {2},
Pages = {327-363},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We advance a theory of pigmentocratic executive approval that accounts
   for both skin color-based group attachments and deviations in skin tone
   between citizens and leaders. We argue that such deviations will
   decrease approval most strongly for those lighter in complexion than the
   incumbent. We further argue that individuals will most strongly punish
   incumbents for poor economic performance when their skin tone is lighter
   than the executive's. To test our theory, we assess the skin tone of
   dozens of leaders from the Americas, and we couple the resulting measure
   with mass survey data from the leaders' countries. Our findings
   demonstrate that executive approval throughout the Americas replicates
   patterns of ``pigmentocracy{''}-inequalities and hierarchies that
   privilege lighter skin tones.},

   an overview of the main information pathologies that are increasingly
   affecting liberal democratic polities, including misinformation,

   on Russell Muirhead and Nancy L. Rosenblum's (2019) book A Lot of People
   Are Saying: The New Conspiracism and the Assault on Democracy, from
   which this symposium takes inspiration and outlines its key argument.
   Finally, the Introduction provides a brief summary of the articles in
   the symposium, explaining their contribution to debates on conspiracism
   and on other key areas of research in contemporary political theory and
   political science.},

Abstract = {Legislative activity-whether votes or communications-is often
   represented in a single partisan or ideological dimension. But as
   lawmakers communicate in various venues (e.g., traditional, direct, or
   social media), the extent to which these estimates are
   interchangeable-reflecting a common underlying dimension-is unclear. We
   estimate a partisan dimension in members' tweets, Facebook posts,
   e-newsletters, press releases, and one-minute House floor speeches for
   the 116th U.S. Congress and test the extent to which representations
   remain consistent across different venues. We find that while Democrats
   are consistently separable from Republicans, members' relative
   intra-party positions frequently shift between venues. This is likely
   driven by differences in the affordances and audiences present in each
   venue, as venues with more nationalized audiences (such as social media)
   show higher levels of rhetorical polarization than venues with more
   local audiences (e-newsletters). These results suggest that the level of
   polarization we observe depends on where we look, and that the scholars
   of congressional communication should explicitly consider the input they
   use to measure partisanship.},

Abstract = {Parliamentary committees can be powerful vehicles to oversee government
   administration, including, on occasion, by bringing to light genuine
   issues of wrongdoing or impropriety. Balanced against the benefit of
   transparency is the possible harm that can arise to witnesses who may be
   reluctantly called into a public and political arena. This was
   illustrated in the 57th Parliament of New South Wales, which saw the
   extensive and unprecedented use of committee powers to obtain documents
   and take evidence in public. This paper takes two inquiries from this
   period as case studies to explore the use of committee powers and
   corresponding protections for witnesses. To assess the protections, we
   use the lens of procedural fairness, a fundamental concept underpinning
   the legitimacy of many public institutions. We consider the bias rule
   and the hearing rule, components of procedural fairness in
   administrative law, and how they can be interpreted in a parliamentary
   context. We argue that developments such as the speed of online
   publishing and broadcasting and declining trust in public institutions
   means there is more imperative than ever for parliaments to ensure that
   committee powers are exercised in a way that is seen as procedurally
   fair. While noting the NSW Legislative Council has already gone some way
   to embedding procedurally fair practices, we find that there is scope
   for strengthening these, especially around providing reasonable notice
   of hearings, publishing untested allegations that may cause reputational
   damage, and protecting privacy and personally sensitive information.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the rationale for the Belt and Road Initiative
   (BRI) and conducts an empirical analysis utilising a revised gravity
   model linking connective infrastructure constructed under the auspices
   of the BRI with global trade in the 2010-22 period. The authors'
   empirical analysis shows that BRI connective infrastructure projects are
   beneficial to both the export and import countries. After controlling
   for all other factors, the existence of connective infrastructure in the
   export country is associated with a 25\% increase in its export value,
   with a significant reduction in the transport costs.},

Abstract = {This ethnographic research examines practices related to alcohol
   consumption in the traditional area of San Andres Cholula, namely, in
   the region comprised of the eight neighborhoods participating in the
   ``cargo system,{''} a religious and socio-spatial institution
   responsible for organizing ecclesiastical festivities. Using
   anthropological fieldwork as the research methodology, it observes how
   male alcoholization, shielded by popular religiosity and supported by
   local authorities, institutionalizes gender practices that legitimize
   violence. These practices, veiled under the guise of ``traditions,{''}
   act to the detriment of the living conditions of local women. In this
   context, the lens of postcolonial feminism enables the understanding of
   women's responses and actions in the face of impositions and demands
   from the local gender regime.},

Abstract = {The impact of the feminist movement has resonated in the field of Higher
   Education, giving rise to an increasingly large body of research that is
   sensitive to the gender perspective. Since Political Science educates
   future professionals, it is desirable to carry out research into the
   effect of gender biases on the learning process of Political Science
   students. For this reason, this article aims to show the findings of a
   study carried out at the University of the Basque Country with the
   purpose of contributing to the identification and understanding of
   gender inequalities in Political Science classrooms. The conclusions not
   only suggest that admitting the existence of a sex-gender system is a
   central factor in understanding the persistence of gender inequalities,
   but also reveal that a transformation in academia which involves
   training a feminist awareness of both professors and students could
   contribute to reducing gender inequalities.},

Abstract = {The literature on populism is divided on whether economic factors are
   significant and robust causes of populism. To clarify this, we performed
   the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence of a
   causal association between economic insecurity and populism. We combined
   database searches with searching the citations of eligible studies and
   recently published reviews. We identified and reviewed thirty-six
   studies and presented a concise narrative summary and numerical
   synthesis of the key findings. Although we found significant
   heterogeneity in several dimensions, all studies reported a significant
   causal association. A recurrent magnitude was that economic insecurity
   explained around one-third of recent surges in populism. We tested for
   publication bias by conducting a funnel-plot asymmetry test and a
   density discontinuity test of the distribution of t-statistics. We found
   significant evidence of publication bias; however, the causal
   association between economic insecurity and populism remains significant
   after controlling for it.},

Abstract = {Although positive campaigning is a widely used communication strategy in
   election campaigns, determinants aside from political characteristics
   and gender are largely unknown. However, the personality traits of
   candidates could affect campaigning strategies beyond these factors.
   Recent research shows that people with an aversive ({''}dark{''})
   personality tend to self-promote and are attracted to leadership
   positions. Transferring these findings to self-promotion in election
   campaigns, I ask if candidates with a more aversive personality use
   positive campaigning more often. 2,133 candidates who ran for 10 state
   parliaments in Germany in 2021, 2022, and 2023 self-reported how often
   they used positive campaigning. Analyses via structural equation
   modeling show that the candidates' aversive personality is positively
   and significantly related to their use of positive campaigning and that
   this relationship holds when controlling for political and
   sociodemographic characteristics. The implications of the findings and
   potential pathways for further research are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article develops a blueprint for creating online writing groups
   (OWGs) to support scholars who are directly and indirectly affected by
   disaster. Those who are living in regions affected by natural disasters
   face a severe psychological toll along with physical and logistical
   challenges. Furthermore, scholars in the diaspora who are watching their
   colleagues go about daily life while they struggle to meet writing
   deadlines can also experience detrimental psychological effects,
   including isolation anxiety. Findings from disaster studies research
   suggest that communal coping strategies can mitigate the short- and
   long-term challenges to mental health, including spiraling concerns
   about productivity that, in turn, inhibit productivity. My research
   builds on these studies, as well as analyses of virtual platforms used
   during the COVID-19 pandemic, to identify specific aspects of OWGs that
   can provide community and structure for scholars in the wake of natural
   disasters. I draw from my experience of creating and hosting a Zoom
   writing group for scholars from Turkey and Syria in the aftermath of the
   February 2023 earthquakes. In addition to participant observation of
   more than 240 two-hour sessions held over 42 weeks between March and
   December 2023, I draw from a survey-based assessment and email
   correspondence with participants to develop a best-practices model that
   I hope other scholars will replicate.},

Abstract = {Ecuador TV, the state-run public television of Ecuador, was conceived as
   a fundamental component of the Correa era. From a professional point of
   view, this study aims to decode the historical and current value
   attributed to it as a public broadcaster. To achieve this goal, 31
   interviews were conducted with Ecuadorian communication specialists and
   professionals. The results show that Ecuador TV represents a missed
   opportunity, mainly due to the politicisation of the government and the
   strong socio-political polarisation of the country.},

Abstract = {In recent years, scholars have observed that political parties' policy
   positions frequently fit the preferences of well-to-do voters better
   than those of the less well-to-do; a phenomenon known as policy
   congruence inequality. While the existence of inequality in policy
   congruence is well-established, we currently only have a modest
   understanding of the causes of it. We develop an argument proposing that
   the political mobilisation of citizens with low socioeconomic status
   (SES) both in the parliamentary channel, in the form of high turnout,
   and in the extra-parliamentary channel, in the form of high union
   density, is pivotal. Both high turnout and union density force parties
   to pay more attention to the preferences of the disadvantaged, thereby
   creating lower policy congruence inequality. To test the argument, we
   have collected and harmonised election surveys and party manifestos
   covering 90 elections in Australia, Denmark, Germany, Sweden,
   Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, covering several
   decades until today, yielding more than 120,000 voter-party dyads.
   Employing this new dataset, our results confirm that the political
   mobilisation of citizens with low SES is a strong predictor of policy
   congruence inequality. This finding nuances the conclusion of extant
   research by showing that low-SES citizens are not always on the losing
   side politically. It also implies the important role of maintaining or
   maybe even increasing turnout and union membership among the
   disadvantaged in society. Places where either turnout or union density
   is slipping in these years are likely to witness further increases in
   policy congruence inequality in the years to come.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explain the deviant German case of an early and
   comprehensive regulation of party donations (combining a high level of
   transparency and incentives for small donations). Given the limited
   explanatory power of economic and institutional factors, the article
   emphasises the causal role of ideas for a policy stabilisation which
   occurred after 1993. A process-tracing analysis suggests that the
   1983-1993 reform period was characterised by a conflict of ideas. During
   this conflict, ideas regarding undisclosed donations as an
   anti-democratic interference with democratic political competition came
   to prevail over ideas regarding all donations as a necessary condition
   for democratic competition irrespective of their regulation. The key
   actors in this conflict were, on the one hand, the new Green party which
   resuscitated the idea of donations being potentially anti-democratic
   and, on the other hand, the Constitutional Court which ultimately
   endorsed this ideational legacy promoted by the Greens. After 1993,
   donations in Germany came to be accepted as a necessary evil whose
   anti-democratic potential had to be limited by transparency obligations
   and incentives for small donations. The findings presented here suggest
   that policymakers need to link attempts to regulate party donations to
   ideational legacies (if available) to successfully tackle political
   corruption.},

Abstract = {Tragic events such as terrorist attacks have been shown to influence
   voters' policy preferences, but less is known about whether such events
   also affect actual immigration policy. In this study, I bring new
   evidence to this question by examining whether migrant shipwrecks and
   terrorist attacks affected asylum decisions in France during the refugee
   crisis of 2015-16. I find that asylum officers were more likely to
   approve an individual's refugee application if a shipwreck has recently
   been in the news than they are otherwise. Yet they were less likely to
   grant refugee status to asylum seekers from Syria and Iraq after a
   terrorist attack. Together, these findings suggest that tragic events
   can affect immigration policy through their influence on asylum
   officers.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 29},
Abstract = {Social media platforms play a central role in the structure of political
   discourse today. It is imperative to theorise about why and how we
   should regulate these institutions to manage some of the problems they
   raise for political discourse, namely misinformation and disinformation,
   hate speech, and polarising content. In this paper, I scrutinise their
   business models to form a basis of justification and strategy to
   regulate social media platforms. I argue that, in virtue of their
   business models, platforms are morally complicit with malicious actors
   in quickly and widely spreading their disinformation, hate speech, and
   provocative claims. I do this by rejecting the claim that platforms are
   merely intermediaries that reflect their users popular preferences and
   therefore cannot be complicitous with malicious actors as they have no
   intentional participation. With this basis of justifying regulation, I
   propose a progressive tax on platforms advertising revenue based on the
   number of users they have and show how this is preferable to banning the
   business model. This can remove the main incentive social media
   platforms have to be complicit with malicious actors without further
   consolidating the `winner take all' nature of the social media market.},

Abstract = {In fiscal redistribution negotiations, fiscally weaker sub-units aim to
   secure more funding but are disempowered by their dependency and lack of
   bargaining chips. What kind of negotiation strategies do fiscally weak
   actors rely on to maximize their bargaining positions in redistributive
   negotiations? The article puts forward a novel strategy of discursive
   framing whereby relatively powerless actors can reach successful
   agreements. Two strategies of framing, communitarian and coercive, are
   observed inductively through a comparative case study analysis of two
   instances of sub-federal redistribution negotiations in Canada. The
   findings reveal that `more is not always better': more publicity and
   aggression can backfire, while communitarian strategies grounded in
   normative argumentation can prove effective despite their
   non-confrontational nature. Even a mixed communitarian-coercive strategy
   can prove effective given that sub-units remain consistent with their
   initial objectives and apply pressure incrementally. The lessons learned
   from these Canadian cases have broader implications for studying the
   dynamics of redistributive negotiations globally.},

Abstract = {The article investigates how gender differences in school performance
   are conceptualized in recent Swedish and Norwegian public commission
   reports against the backdrop of an increasing public focus on ``problem
   boys{''} and boys' underachievement in school as a policy challenge. We
   found substantive country differences, despite regime similarities and
   the considerable level of gender equality norms and policy diffusion
   within the Nordic region. Whereas Swedish reports address gender
   differences in school performance and behavior equipped with radical
   feminist perspectives and theories of patriarchal oppression, Norwegian
   reports largely avoid explicit references to feminist theory and include
   analyses of the unfair burdens of boys in school and society. It is
   argued that the diverging approaches are connected to features of the
   commissions and of the wider knowledge regimes of the two gender
   equality forerunners, but also to historical differences in the
   ideological underpinnings of Swedish and Norwegian gender equality
   policy making.},

Abstract = {When is speech on social media toxic enough to warrant content
   moderation? Platforms impose limits on what can be posted online, but
   also rely on users' reports of potentially harmful content. Yet we know
   little about what users consider inadmissible to public discourse and
   what measures they wish to see implemented. Building on past work, we
   conceptualize three variants of toxic speech: incivility, intolerance,
   and violent threats. We present results from two studies with
   pre-registered randomized experiments (Study 1, \$
   N=\textbackslash{}mathrm\{5,130\} \$; Study 2, \$
   N=\textbackslash{}mathrm\{3,734\} \$) to examine how these variants
   causally affect users' content moderation preferences. We find that
   while both the severity of toxicity and the target of the attack matter,
   the demand for content moderation of toxic speech is limited. We discuss
   implications for the study of toxicity and content moderation as an
   emerging area of research in political science with critical
   implications for platforms, policymakers, and democracy more broadly.},

Title = {The decline of political leader popularity: Partisan dealignment and
   leader integrity in Australia},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {87},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Are political leaders less popular among voters than they used to be? If
   so, why? Many studies have mapped a decline in citizens' political trust
   and satisfaction with democracy, but we know less about whether leader
   popularity is in decline, and if so, what drives this trend. This paper
   examines these questions using unique data on major party leader
   popularity and leadership traits from the Australian Election Study
   collected over four decades. The results show that Australia's major
   party leaders have become less popular over time. We test a theoretical
   model which explains declining leader popularity by partisan dealignment
   and the role of leader integrity. The analyses show that the effect of
   partisanship on leader popularity has weakened over time, while leader
   integrity traits have become more important. These findings apply to
   both major party leaders that have won elections as well as those
   leaders that have lost elections.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes data from 1999-2019, evidencing strategies utilized
   by Nigerian Subnational Governments (SNGs) for attracting inward Foreign
   Direct Investment (FDI). These strategies are unique for several
   reasons, including the fact that they highlight the evidence of
   paradiplomacy in Nigeria, a case study that is understudied in the
   paradiplomacy literature. These strategies are also a deviation from the
   conventional protocols for FDI mobilization in Nigeria. Drawing on
   Duchacek's conceptualization of these strategies as a percolation of
   sovereign boundaries, i.e. the idea that SNGs are permeating
   inter-sovereign `sieves' designed to restrict their forays into the
   international plane, this paper conceptually maps and empirically
   assesses the varied expressions and prevalence of these strategies.
   Although these strategies are yet to be constitutionally challenged by
   the central government, they reveal a growing porosity of Nigeria's
   sovereign boundaries and necessitate a critical reassessment of the
   extant intergovernmental frameworks that govern FDI mobilization in
   Nigeria.},

Abstract = {When the United States Supreme Court agrees to hear a case, it also
   determines what legal questions it will answer in that case. We
   investigate the variation in the Court's acceptance, alteration, and
   addition of questions presented (QPs) in petitions for the writ of
   certiorari. Examining data on granted cases from 2010-2020, we find that
   the Court is overwhelmingly passive, accepting the petitioners' QPs
   without comment in most cases. We also find variation related to
   ideological alignment and petitioner identity. These findings have
   important implications for our understanding of the Court's policymaking
   efforts and its exercise of agenda-setting power and underscore the
   important role that litigants play in legal development.},

Abstract = {Many authoritarian regimes seek to blunt everyday acts of resistance and
   social mobilization through co-optation rather than adopting riskier
   tools like outright repression. What are the political imprints of
   authoritarian-era co-optation after a transition to democracy? We
   examine this question in Portugal, where rural corporatist institutions
   known as Casas do Povo sought to co-opt peasants and dismantle worker
   mobilization in the fascist era. We find conditional effects for the
   consequences of rural co-optation in Portugal's restive southern region,
   where Casas do Povo took on particular importance given ongoing social
   mobilization over exploitative labor conditions in the countryside.
   Absent robust co-optation, social mobilization in the fascist era
   translated into greater support for the left-wing Portuguese Communist
   Party after democratization and less support for the right. But the
   electoral legacies of social mobilization are absent where the fascist
   regime created early Casas do Povo, facilitating co-optation.},

Abstract = {The war that engulfed Syria in March 2011 is considered to be the most
   destructive event in its modern history. In addition to the massive
   human losses and millions displaced, physical capital stock and trade
   losses are comprehensive; by 2019, the United Nations estimated
   conflict-related damage to physical capital at US\$442.2 billion
   (infrastructure destruction estimated at US\$120 billion); and trade
   witnessed a collapse of about 100\% in just a decade. The study focuses
   on the impact of the conflict on capital and trade and their specificity
   in a ``multipolar{''} world to a small but ``node{''} country like
   Syria. Using the error correction model, findings supported the view
   that (1) underdevelopment is linked to persistent and widespread
   international and regional intervention and economic sanctions; (2)
   political and geopolitical factors are highly associated with the
   state's capacity to raise investment and trade volume. Further, the
   study pointed out the importance of both public capital and trade in
   growth in the pre-conflict phase, but not the private capital. Recovery
   and reconstruction are possible only with relative peace drawn by
   political settlement between the dominant and contending parties in the
   geopolitical context.},

Abstract = {When international laws or norms are violated, an enforcer can punish
   the violator, offer concessions for its renewed compliance, or tolerate
   it. Punishment is often costlier than concessions or toleration but
   signals to other states that violation will be met with penalties rather
   than rewards or acceptance. By influencing other states' expectations
   about what will happen if they get caught violating, the choice of
   response can thus encourage or discourage subsequent compliance.
   Anticipating this, an enforcer is more willing to punish when it faces a
   larger audience of potential near-term violators. Focusing on the
   nuclear nonproliferation norm, we show statistically that enforcer
   responses appear to have affected whether states subsequently pursued
   the bomb historically and that this effect is stronger than other
   hypothesized determinants of proliferation decisions. We also use
   primary sources to document that policy makers recognized and heeded
   this influence in a range of cases.},

Abstract = {science researchers often encounter individuals who can articulate a
   highly developed discourse about their lifestyle, which they frame as
   being centered around a ``line{''} of political or religious conduct.
   This volume revisits the process through which these respondents work to
   achieve coherence in their lives, drawing on the tools of dispositional
   sociology. The focus is specifically on the socialization processes that
   shape this work of self-coherence, considering both the institutions
   that facilitate this process and the dispositions that enable
   self-reformation-what these dispositions entail and how they are
   developed. This introduction first highlights the social exceptionalism
   of these intense commitments to ``being coherent{''}, and examines how
   the studies in this volume address both the reorganization of individual
   practices and the rationalizations behind them. Four key dimensions are
   explored in greater depth: the various forms of institutional
   ``envelopment{''} experienced by those striving for coherence; the
   personal work they undertake to achieve it; the social and professional
   contexts in which they are situated; and the crises and adjustments that
   punctuate their commitment.},

   Italian MPs in Overseas Constituencies},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Among European countries, Italy is one of the relatively few cases to
   provide a quota of reserved parliamentary seats for non-resident
   citizens. Despite an increased scientific interest in the topic, the
   group of MPs elected in Overseas Constituencies remains overlooked in
   the available literature. The gap relates to factors such as their
   socio-biographical profile, precedent careers, parliamentary activity,
   the role played in their recruitment by the party abroad or at a
   national level, and their style of representation. In this vein, the
   article investigates the career profiles of Italian MPs elected in
   Overseas Constituencies from 2006 (the first elections with the
   introduction of citizen representatives living abroad) to 2022. Based on
   an original data set and through an analysis of their biographical and
   political characteristics, the article builds a typology of elected MPs
   abroad by cross-referencing two dimensions derived from the literature:
   the linkage with the host country and the presence of previous political
   and associational experiences. The analysis shows that different types
   of MPs have different career lengths and a different capacity to collect
   preference votes.},

Abstract = {The Coronavirus international public health emergency, changes in labor
   contracts stemming from the digital revolution and the practice of labor
   of activities through digital platforms have had direct impacts on labor
   relationships. In this paper the situation/problem in discussion aims to
   analyze whether the measures to combat the Coronavirus pandemic were
   efficient in protecting workers amidst the Social State crisis, based on
   a comparative approach between Brazil, Portugal and Spain. The research
   adopts the dialectical method from the social contradictions between the
   guarantees for protection of the working class and the preservation of
   the capitalist mode of production in the aforementioned countries. The
   hypothesis speaks on the crisis of the Social Welfare State and its
   contribution to aggravate the consequences of the pandemic. The
   resumption of the prevalence of social values of work, eradication of
   poverty, marginalization and reduction of social and regional
   inequalities are reflective sources of the capacity for state action and
   constitutional normativity in times of crisis.},

Abstract = {- Studies of political entourages and staff have shown the importance of
   the phenomenon of ``pantouflage{''}, where an employee moves permanently
   from the public to the private sector. A new phenomenon, retro-revolving
   door, which involves people going back and forth between the public and
   private sectors, concerns those in positions of power, with the novelty
   that for a time they hold positions as interest representatives. This
   position, which was recognised by the Sapin II Act in 2016, provides an
   opportunity to analyse a process that gives it credibility: the ongoing
   development of political capital, which gives these people as many
   opportunities to work in the private sector as to return to the public
   sector. This article therefore sets out to show how this capital
   supports the movement of these agents as much as it is composed and
   maintained during these experiences.},

   ruling on the Duty of Vigilance of multinational companies},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2024},
Number = {148},
Pages = {119-146},
Abstract = {Beyond the symbolic stakes involved in the adoption of a new law, the
   implementation of a new legal obligation can only be judged on the basis
   of the initial court rulings. But how is the very first legal decision
   made? To what extent is the judicial translation of the law a de facto
   extension of the legislative work, given that the judges are forced to
   interpret what is hidden beneath the silence and imprecision of the text
   ? The article addresses these questions through the particularly
   emblematic case of the implementation of the 2017 law on the Duty of
   Vigilance of parent companies. Extending the botanical metaphor of the
   ``dispute tree{''}, we here propose a narrative designed to observe and
   analyze the processes that have played a part in the development and
   outcome of the first Duty of Vigilance litigation. In the context of
   what is perhaps a ``regulatory moment{''} in the legal order, we
   highlight the extent to which the determination of militant
   organizations to obtain a ruling from the judicial judge effectively
   came up against a plurality of forces pushing towards any alternative
   form of dispute resolution.},

Title = {The Changing Unpolitics of Covid-19 Vaccine Procurement},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Populist governments engage in ``unpolitics{''} when the electoral
   incentives for doing so outweigh the distributive risks from policy
   failure. Studying the joint procurement of vaccines against Covid-19, I
   show that a group consisting of mostly populist governments led by
   Austria negotiated in bad faith, rejected compromise solutions, and
   obstructed joint problem-solving. They deployed these ``unpolitical{''}
   tactics only once the legal framework for joint procurement was in place
   and the roll-out of the jointly ordered vaccines had begun. At this
   point, populist governments no longer faced the distributive risk of
   having limited access to affordable vaccines. By contrast, the electoral
   incentives for hard-nosed bargaining in bad faith had increased, as the
   distributive issue of vaccine allocation became more salient and as
   populist governments came under pressure to deflect responsibility for
   having ordered insufficient vaccine doses.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {During the 1990s, the Berlin women's prison was reformed to do justice
   to female inmates. This redesigning of space and programs was intended
   to meet womenspecific conditions and needs. The present paper engages
   with this prison reform as transformation in the name of gender justice.
   Based on interviews with prison reformers, criminologists, and
   policymakers, as well as on the analysis of historical documents, we
   illuminate how a specific figure of the ``criminalized woman{''} helps
   to translate the abstract notion of social justice into situated
   practice. From the 1970s onward, a new knowledge of women's crime would
   emerge: it constituted female offenders as victims of patriarchal
   oppression and victimization, allowing the prison system to be
   criticized as androcentric and discriminatory against women. We argue
   that subsequent reform pursued gender justice in the form of
   difference-based, genderresponsive programs and spaces targeting
   individual inmates' character and mindset. Thereby, the reformers'
   initial critique of social justice would be unintentionally
   depoliticized and so gender, economic, and political inequalities
   remained unaddressed. Our purpose is hence twofold: first, to review the
   recent history of women's incarceration in Germany, and second, to add a
   social justice focus to the international criminological debate on
   gender, prison, and reform.},

Journal = {POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {112},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-28},
Abstract = {The article addresses the question of why, despite the seemingly
   long-standing accumulation of economic and technical conditions
   sufficient for building, if not communism, then socialism, the left-wing
   forces are unable to take advantage of this, and yield the initiative to
   the right-wing, conservative, and even reactionary forces. The author
   explains this situation by the rationale that the mindset of the left is
   still dominated by a flat liberal progressivism characterized by clich
   \& eacute; ideas about the progressive and the reactionary, but it lacks
   tools to adequately assess the reasons for the ``reactionary{''}
   sympathies of the broad masses and to admit that these masses have
   ``grounds for concern{''} at the very least. As a theoretical basis, the
   article uses the concept of human prehistory of the classics of Marxism.
   The author demonstrates that the underlying dichotomy of the alienated
   and authentic, human and inhuman does not coincide with the dichotomy of
   ``reactionary{''} and ``progressive{''}. The Modern Age is examined as
   both an epoch of reaction (in the literal sense of the word, net of
   ideological connotations) and that of progress. In order to resolve
   these issues, the author introduces the concept of retropractice, which
   is supposed to help adequately describe these seemingly
   ``reactionary{''} and ``con servative{''} sides of Modernity.
   Retropractices, in contrast to ``reaction{''}, possess an emancipatory
   and alienation-reducing potential. The flaw of the left is that they
   fail to comprehensively conceptualize the meaning of retropractices
   because they view them only as ``reaction{''} and ``conservatism{''} in
   the usual sense. However, socialism, if realized, will largely turn out
   to be precisely a set of retropractices.},

Abstract = {Central Asia has been an area of structured multiculturalism since time
   immemorial. The tension - sometimes even symbiosis - between highly
   specialized, cattle-breeding equestrian nomads and sedentary advanced
   civilizations shaped the physiognomy of Central Asia well into the
   modern era. Violent conflicts led to the large-scale migration of
   peoples. The symbiosis produced the legendary Silk Road, a high point of
   transcultural coexistence. However, the specific characteristics of the
   region have been reshaped since the 18th century, when first the eastern
   part of Central Asia came under Chinese rule and then the western part
   under Russian rule in the 19th century. The borders of today's nation
   states are thus the product of imperial competition and Soviet
   nationality policy.},

   {[}Anonymous], 17 Records of the 47th NCB, Report on Coral for use as Airplane Runways or Roads, RG 1, Box 1, NAVFAC Archive. This report was prepared by M.E. Milone, CCM(AA) USNR and submitted through channels to the Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks by letter dated 12 Oct 43 and endorsed by the acting OiC of the 47th NCB. There are several other good references on coral and coral airstrips but this is by far the best detailed on actual construction technique and very specific to the experience at Segi Point. It was written and submitted ``hoping that it may be of some use to other construction battalions who may have the same type of material.{''} Additional information of coral airstrip construction is contained in the chapter, written by Nathan Bowers, ``Airfields of Coral{''} in Bulldozers Come First: The Story of US War Construction in Foreign Lands (McGraw-Hill: New York, 1944). This is a very detail description of the various construction methods used by the Seabees throughout the Pacific including standard techniques and depths of placed layers (8{''}) and final compacted layer thickness (6{''}). In this chapter Bowers also talks about the ``set up{''} time of different coral types with ``live coral{''}, that free of the clay type material at Segi, setting up in approximately 3 day and coral such as that described at Segi setting up in 5 days. This chapter is a re-written and expanded article from Engineering New Record (July 13, 1944) pp\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}. 80-85. Another article, ``Characteristics of Coral Deposits{''} by Harold T. Stearns, in the same ENR issue describes the nature and chemical properties of coral and why it will set up like concrete. This has to do with corals lime content and the presence of water and other bonding agents such as salt and volcanic ash. Volcanic ash is considered to be one of the ingredients in the ``mud{''} from on land coral deposits such as those at Segi which actually could have aided in the set up..

Abstract = {This article aims to highlight the importance of collective memory
   processes from a qualitative perspective, through life stories and a
   reflection on the psychosocial effects on the participants and the
   contexts of the armed conflict, as well as the fundamental
   characteristics of this phenomenon in Colombia. The text presents the
   experiences of young people from Boyac \& aacute;, based on 14 life
   stories collected from a group of 540 students in an undergraduate
   program at a private university in the department. The participants
   identified themselves as direct and indirect victims of the conflict.
   The purpose is to give voice to these testimonies and analyze, from the
   perspective of the historical memory group's general report, the
   typologies of violence in this context. It can be concluded that the
   stories reflect the diverse circumstances experienced by young
   university students from Boyac \& aacute;, revealing the different
   realities of the internal armed conflict that affected Colombia at the
   end of the 20th century.},

Abstract = {Employing critical discourse analysis (CDA), this paper examines how
   medicalized concepts of mental illness and paternalistic views are
   framed and used in the legal case, Thompson and Empowerment Council v.
   Ontario (2013). The paper argues that the case utilizes a pathologized
   notion of mental illness to justify and defend the legality of
   involuntary treatment, specifically, the community treatment orders
   (CTOs) under Ontarios' Mental Health Act (MHA). . This paper shows how
   the Thompson case relies on medical reductionism and binary notions of
   capacity versus incapacity while failing to consider intersecting
   factors and contextual and social determinants of psychosocial
   disability. Following this, I suggest that a postmodernist relational
   theory of disability could change the legal discourses about the MHA. .
   Challenging the medicalized view of mental illness through the
   relational approach to psychosocial disability could have strengthened
   the plaintiffs' case and prompted legal reforms for better safeguards
   under the MHA. . In doing so, this paper offers a basis and future
   direction for legal reforms that can lead to legal mandates for improved
   social and healthcare services to enhance the autonomy of individuals
   subjected to CTOs.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {283-303},
Abstract = {This article uses the concept of a progressive jail assemblage to think
   about the focus on jails as both a target of social justice organizing
   and a tool for advancing social justice goals. Drawing on ethnographic
   research conducted among formerly incarcerated organizers and their
   allies in Western Massachusetts (New England), I explore how the
   sheriffs who operate jails in this region, along with their
   collaborators, have increasingly sought to redefine the figure of the
   criminal as not just a danger to others but also a danger to themselves,
   someone in need of rehabilitative treatment and even care. In doing so,
   these sheriffs have attempted to reinvent their role, from the
   quintessentially American crime fighting figure, to one who is also a
   provider of care. Social justice activism has helped to expand the
   ``caring{''} role of the jail, through increased addiction treatment,
   re-entry support, and community outreach - even to the extent of
   incarcerating individuals dealing with addiction who have not been
   charged with a crime. As progressive jails have been reconfigured as
   providers of care, abolitionists are confronted with the ongoing dilemma
   of how to remain a figure opposed to the use of prisons and jails
   without being seen as against care.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Authoritarian governments heavily rely on propaganda as a means of
   maintaining rule. Although scholars have examined the effects of
   propaganda exposure, much less is known about attitudes toward
   propaganda messages. In this study, we explore the foundations
   underlying propaganda support in China by examining the role of
   political trust, a primary ingredient for explaining public support for
   government actions and compliance. Using a survey with a broad sample of
   Chinese internet users and taking measures to address endogeneity, we
   found that trust in government, whether measured indirectly (implicitly)
   or directly (explicitly), is a vital source of positive attitudes toward
   propaganda and hence its potential effects. Our results have important
   implications for understanding the foundations of propaganda support,
   the scope of political trust, and the value of indirect measures for
   gauging public opinion in authoritarian contexts. They also suggest that
   propaganda may lose its bite under certain conditions.},

Abstract = {Do socioeconomic disparities between ethnic groups influence whether a
   country democratizes and remains democratic? I propose that, on average,
   high levels of ethnic inequality do not affect the prospects of
   democratization due to competing mechanisms. Although such inequalities
   give rise to grievances that fuel the demand for democracy, they also
   make the ruling elites from dominant groups less willing to concede
   political rights. However, ethnic inequality is generally associated
   with an increased risk of democratic breakdowns because high-inequality
   countries are more likely to experience politicized ethnic divides,
   distributional conflicts, and polarization. Investigating these
   arguments with time-series, cross-national data, I find that while there
   is a relatively strong and robust association between ethnic inequality
   and the risk of democratic breakdown, ethnic inequality is not
   associated with transitions to democracy. Examinations of potential
   mechanisms based on national and group-level data lend further support
   to the argument.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},

Volume = {18},

Pages = {607-627},
Abstract = {We examine the design and implementation of the Canada Housing Benefit
   (CHB), which is a rent subsidy provided to low-income tenants and an
   important part of the National Housing Strategy. Focusing on three
   Atlantic provinces, we explore to what extent the CHB adheres to just
   housing, based on the perspectives of stakeholders (n=18) who work with
   people living in poverty. We find that the CHB fails to provide
   assistance to many marginalized renters, thus perpetuating their
   exclusion. The CHB also falls short in providing housing that is
   affordable and secure, and lacks involvement in decision-making on the
   part of those with lived experience. Finally, the current state of the
   rental market, including a lack of units and landlord discrimination,
   poses significant limitations to its implementation. We conclude that
   the design of the CHB needs to be overhauled to comply with just
   housing, but that the housing terrain in which allowances are provided
   needs to be transformed or just housing will remain unrealized.},

Abstract = {Can culture constrain policy implementation - and if so, under what
   conditions and for whom? In this paper, we test to what extent
   traditional values of numerology in China impeded the environmental
   benefits of a well-designed license plate policy. We take advantage of
   two natural experiments in Beijing. First, in 2008 authorities began
   limiting cars on the road by restricting specific plate numbers each
   day. Second, in 2011 authorities introduced a lottery policy-making it
   difficult to obtain any plate. We find that (1) non-traditionalists
   abandoned cultural norms, accepted non-lucky plate numbers, and switched
   to newer, greener vehicles, whereas (2) traditionalists - fearing the
   loss of their lucky plate numbers - held on to their older
   pollutant-emitting cars. We test our argument using a CO readings
   dataset, a Beijing driver survey, and a license plate image database. We
   find strong evidence that emissions were lower when lucky numbers were
   restricted, and the pattern strengthened gradually over time.},

Abstract = {Latin American party systems are characterized by a proliferation of new
   parties of very different sizes, backgrounds, and developmental
   trajectories, which poses a conceptual challenge. Historically,
   conceptualizations of new parties have often prioritized data
   accessibility over methodological and theoretical rigor. As a result,
   they have produced a plethora of highly heterogeneous cases that are
   ill-suited for theory testing. To address this problem, we propose the
   development of a conceptual tool aimed at identifying a subset of
   relevant new parties, termed ``break-in parties{''} (BIP) because of
   their potential impact on prevailing patterns of representation and
   party competition. We have identified a corpus of 24 such parties
   founded between 1960 and 2002 in South America. These parties exhibit
   sufficient similarity to facilitate meaningful attributions, while also
   providing variability in relevant independent and dependent variables
   for testing theories of party system change through the emergence and
   success of new parties, a topic that has received considerable attention
   in recent years.},

   disorganizes the word and image},
Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {30},
Pages = {224-251},
Abstract = {What happens between word and image? Utterance and picture? This paper
   aims to investigate how the film Nova Dubai (2014), by Gustavo Vinagre,
   and the anthology O poeta pornosiano (2011), by Glauco Mattoso,
   disorganize words and images by rupturing the representation through
   pornography. Thus, inspired by the cartographic method proposed by F \&
   eacute;lix Guattari and Gilles Deleuze, this research performs a mapping
   between literature and cinema by following different levels (from
   expressive to representational) in order to follow the desiring flow
   that crosses both works. In this sense, we argue that the mobilization
   of an abject desire, which is summoned by a queer pornography in both
   Vinagre's and Mattoso's works, seeks to reach the reverse of word and
   image. As we pursue this desirous flux, these works open themselves to a
   different relationship between subject and world, rejecting any prospect
   of a utopian future by assuming an ethical- aesthetic-political making
   that moves through this abject desire, sign of a queer negativity.
   Finally, what appears is not the configuration of a fixed and
   well-defined identity of the sexual act or of its participants, but the
   proliferation of dissident and alternative sexualities to the
   heteronormative rubric.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE CIENCIA POLITICA},

Abstract = {The year 2023 in Chile has been an intense year on the political front.
   The challenges faced by the government were exacerbated by opposition
   pressure on security and migration issues and the emergence of
   corruption cases. In this context of turmoil, the country ex-perienced a
   second constitutional failure after the resounding rejection of the
   proposal for the first Constitutional Convention in 2021. Political
   parties agreed on a new process, but the final proposal was rejected by
   56\% of voters in December. For many, this event reveals structural
   problems in Chilean democracy, with fragmented political actors and a
   volatile citizenry. Two data sources were used to analyze what happened
   in 2023 further. The first is Congressional information on parliamentary
   benches and floor votes. The second is a longitudinal survey of three
   moments during the constitutional process. These tools al-lowed us to
   observe the difficulties that the breakdown of legislative discipline
   created for the expectations of the government, as well as the low
   evaluation that citizens had of the political system in general and the
   constitutional process in particular.},

Abstract = {The social outbreak of 2019 caused a deep crisis in the Chilean
   political system, which political parties sought to solve by opening a
   constitutional change process through the Constitutional Convention.
   This institutional response appeared to indicate the outbreak had ended
   and that social movements and political parties acted separately.
   However, this article contends that both actors directly inter-acted,
   arguing that the Convention institutionally prolonged the social
   outbreak. To understand the scope and obstacles of the interaction
   between these actors, I conducted 45 interviews with members of the
   Constitutional Convention (convencionales) both party members and those
   coming from the social movements. By contrasting both perspectives, this
   article finds that the persistence of mutual distrust across members of
   the constitutional convention, along with the time constraints imposed
   by the institutional design of the process, hindered the construction of
   broad agreements. This study offers a detailed view of the internal
   dynamics of the Convention, contributing to the understanding of the
   interaction between activists and parties both at the institutional
   level and in the context of the Chilean social outbreak.},

Abstract = {India, long celebrated as the world's largest and most vibrant
   democracy, is witnessing a troubling erosion of its democratic
   foundations under the rule of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This
   paper critically examines the extent to which the BJP has engaged in
   institutional instrumentalization- strategically leveraging state
   institutions to consolidate power and undermine core democratic norms
   and principles. Central to this analysis is the BJP's manipulation of
   institutional frameworks to serve partisan interests. Tactics include
   the appointment of ideologically aligned judges to the judiciary, the
   suppression of dissent through media control and censorship, and the
   centralization of authority to reshape state institutions. The paper
   explores how these mechanisms have enabled the BJP to dominate public
   discourse, particularly through its command of social media and
   narrative framing around key national issues. Further, the study
   investigates the BJP's influence over civil society, the bureaucracy,
   and political opposition, revealing a pattern of democratic backsliding
   marked by the erosion of civil rights, the weakening of civil liberties,
   and the rise of authoritarian tendencies. The party's embrace of
   religious nationalism-often framed as a matter of national security-has
   contributed to growing intolerance, with freedom of speech, press
   freedom, human rights, and minority protections increasingly under
   threat. In conclusion, this paper reflects on the long-term implications
   of these developments for the future of Indian democracy, raising urgent
   questions about the resilience of democratic institutions in the face of
   majoritarian rule and ideological consolidation.},

Pages = {71-88},
Abstract = {In the 21st century of profound shifts and abrupt plot twists on a
   global scale, the future of the international system remains unclear.
   What is obvious by now, though, is that against this backdrop, African
   states are increasingly looking for ways to defend their own interests
   and positions. Hence their focus on regional integration, as countries
   recognize the benefits of pooling their resources and working together
   to address common challenges with the ultimate aim of fulfilling the
   African Union's vision of: ``An integrated, prosperous and peaceful
   Africa, driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in
   the global arena{''} (Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want). . The evolution
   of regional groups like the Economic Community of West African States
   (ECOWAS), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the
   East African Community (EAC) is an example of this trend. In addition to
   shared objectives, these various African blocs also face common
   challenges and crises. This article focuses particularly on the case of
   the EAC, and its resilience capacity in the context of the COVID-19
   pandemic, as well as the impact of the ongoing DRC-Rwanda standoff. The
   article is divided into three parts: the theoretical framework of crisis
   resilience is described in the first section, the background and ascent
   of the East African Community with a focus on its resilience capacities
   are analyzed in the second section. The third section of the article
   focuses on the covariate shocks facing the EAC in 2020-2023 and its
   response.},

Funding-Text = {role of a guarantor of peace in the region. As a result, the bloc still
   relies mostly on international support to resolve its own internal
   crisis. COVID-19 health crisis Like the rest of the world, the EAC was
   hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Its COVID-19 Response Plan, composed
   of 30 pages of activities to tackle the pandemic with a total budget of
   USD 97,046,212 covering both regional interventions and support to the
   partner states, was supposed to help mitigate paramount challenges to
   the region's economies, health systems, and social structures. 1. The
   EAC member nations' healthcare systems were insufficient due to a lack
   of hospitals and medical facilities. The doctor-to-patient ratio is as
   low as 1:34,000 in Burundi and 1:25,000 in Uganda. The nations struggled
   to meet the pandemic's high demand for medical care. 2. The majority of
   the EAC countries had little funding to fight the pandemic, with around
   5-6\% of the national budget spent on healthcare. This resulted in
   inadequate financing of clinics and hospitals, a shortage of medical
   equipment, and a lack of trained medical personnel. 3. The EAC
   countries' poor testing capability made it challenging to locate and
   isolate sick people. This facilitated the virus's quick spread in some
   nations (Cf. Figure 3) .},

   and the 5 Star Movement (Italy) from a Sequential Analysis},
Journal = {DESAFIOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {In the literature it is usually suggested that populist and
   anti-establishment parties affect democracy. This article proposes an
   alternative view, as democratic plurality can also stimulate the erosion
   of the meaning of these organizations. In this sense, we propose a
   sequential study of the trajectories of Podemos (Spain) and Movimento 5
   Stelle (Italy) from their foundation until the national election after
   their participation in a coalition government (along with political
   parties from the establishment), a moment in which we consider these
   parties no longer have their original anti-system status. It is
   concluded that democracy, in terms of its plurality, is permissive with
   anti-establishment parties when they express a confrontational logic
   toward the entire political establishment, but no more when they decide
   to establish coalitions with at least part of the latter. Adopting this
   path, possible in a fragmented democracy, has a consequence for
   anti-establishment parties: They lose their anti-establishment raison
   d'etre, due to the disappearance of the ``us versus them{''} discourse
   that should be related to the entire political elite.},

Abstract = {This research article presents an unpublished reading in the
   configuration of the Universidad Intercultural de los Pueblos in the
   Colombian Southwest. The introduction contextualizes the problem and the
   theory of the four historical ethos of the Ecuadorian Mexican
   philosopher Bol \& iacute;var Echeverr \& iacute;a. Then, the concept
   and the configuration of the Universidad Intercultural de los Pueblos as
   expressions of the baroque ethos are addressed and the research method
   is clarified. The central thesis is that this university is a singular
   community and organization to resist in the territory to the diverse
   forms of violence and an open possibility in the construction of
   territorial peace. It is concluded that both the Universidad
   Intercultural de los Pueblos and the constitution of territorial peace
   in the Colombian Southwest are the link between moral and geographical
   imagination from the Education-Research in Human Rights and the
   construction of Community Life Plans.},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {533-551},
Abstract = {Epidemics of self-injury are increasingly framed as public health crises
   and risk facing youth in Canada. This article examines the discursive
   construction of youth self-injury as risk in mainstream Canadian news
   articles through a neoliberal governmentality framework. It argues that
   self-injury risk discourses are consistent with neoliberal mental health
   paradigms, which individualize and depoliticize distress while
   responsibilizing individuals for recovery and wellbeing. The
   construction ofyouth self-injury in terms of risk simultaneously
   undergirds the surveillance, regulation, and coercive control of
   self-injuring subjects. Based on a critical discourse analysis of
   Canadian news articles addressing the problem of youth self-injury, this
   article identifies and discusses three interrelated themes from study
   findings: social (media) contagion, failed resilience, and system
   overwhelm. Ultimately, it suggests that the construction ofself-injury
   in terms of risk frames self-injuring youth as failed neoliberal
   subjects. Risk discourses are therefore incompatible with social justice
   paradigms in mental health.},

Abstract = {This article studies the representations of Spain in the discourse of
   Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. The paper starts from a
   theoretical discussion on the formation of memories and political
   identities, and proposes a frame analysis of the president's discursive
   production during his first four years in office (from December 2018 to
   December 2022). To this end, a unit of analysis of 321 speeches,
   selected from among his daily conferences -known as << mananeras >>- has
   been constructed, and three dominant frames have been identified: the
   colonial, the neoliberal and the republican. The conclusions point to
   the conflictive nature of Spain in Lopez Obrador's discourse, insofar as
   he proposes a re -reading of the historical relations between the two
   countries as part of a substantive revision of Mexican political
   identity.},

Abstract = {This article articulates queer theory with critiques of the subject,
   humanism and identity. In doing so, it highlights how a critique of
   heteronormativity is inseparable from the critical work that has been
   done throughout the 20th and 21st centuries regarding the universality
   of the subject. That is, the formulation of a universal human subject
   has produced its Others, who, as such, are relegated to a subordinate
   position of subjugation. Through Paul Preciado's formulation, according
   to which the trans body is the colony, this text articulates the
   critique of this universal subject to reflections on colonialism. It is
   thus a question of showing not only that the production of a transparent
   and universal subject is a violent European invention, but also that its
   presupposed universality could only be sustained through the
   colonisation of the world. Thus, decolonial critique helps to dismiss
   the centrality that Europe has claimed for itself and, at the same time,
   to question the effects of colonialism on the production of bodies.},

   the digital code and masculine domination proposed by Sadie Plant in
   Zeroes and Ones (1997) and by Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein in
   Data Feminism (2020). These critiques are situated within the historical
   and political turning point of the affirmation of the neoliberal
   programme, when identity politics and the capitalist valorization of
   differences reconfigure modern political universalism. To account for
   this transition and the function of algorithms as social operators,
   three different interpretations of the problem of the code -
   constitutionalist, historical and sociological - are then examined, with
   the aim of testing the feminist critiques articulated by Plant,
   D'Ignazio and Klein against the algorithmic processes of social
   reproduction of identities.},

   Bureaucratic Composition},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 31},
Abstract = {An understudied aspect of patronage practices worldwide is how the
   ideological leaning of governments shapes the professional composition
   of the bureaucracy. This article explores this question, aiming to
   determine whether left-wing and right-wing administrations differ in
   their preferences for hiring from various academic or professional
   disciplines. Using Chile as a case study, we leverage a rich
   individual-level dataset of bureaucrats' careers, covering nearly 15,000
   upper- and upper-middle-level bureaucratic hires from 2010 to 2020
   across nearly all central government ministries. Utilizing mixed-effects
   logistic regression models, we find that left-wing governments
   substantially increase the hiring of social scientists, while right-wing
   governments favor economists and elite management professionals. These
   distinct hiring patterns affect top and upper-middle-ranking positions
   and are not confined to specific agencies or ministries. These results
   underscore the significant impact of government ideology on the
   professional composition of bureaucracies, with potentially substantive
   impacts on policy design and implementation.},

Title = {Designing Confucian democracy: A semi-parliamentarian framework},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 26},
Abstract = {Despite Confucian democrats' successful attempt in establishing
   Confucian democracy as a normatively plausible ideal, little has been
   said regarding its institutional design. However, to the extent that
   Confucian democracy involves some synthesis between a formally
   democratic regime and substantively Confucian ends, it has to ask for a
   more specific choice among various possible democratic institutional
   frameworks, so as to make sure that the exact form of the former is
   conducive to the realization of the latter. This article addresses such
   a question by presenting semi-parliamentarianism as an appropriate
   institutional framework for designing Confucian democracy. My central
   claim is that compared with other types of constitutional structure, a
   semi-parliamentarian bicameral one is more likely to simultaneously
   advance Confucian democrats' dual commitments to benevolent government
   and deep harmony. The article thus contributes to both the
   ``institutional turn{''} in democratic theory and the ``meritocracy
   versus democracy{''} debate in contemporary Confucian political theory.},

Abstract = {What are the legacies of defeat? This article examines the National
   Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), a rebel movement
   which fought a 27-year long civil war against the Angolan state until
   its military defeat in 2002, and traces its strategies of legitimisation
   during and after the war. Focusing on the alternative imaginary of the
   Nation upon which UNITA constructed its social base, I argue that the
   legacies of defeat depend on the ability of armed groups to keep alive
   the narratives that supported their struggle and articulate them with
   shifting local realities in the post-war environment.},

Abstract = {Increasing scholarly interest is directed towards the varieties and
   displays of authoritarian legitimation strategies. However, the
   strategic adaptation of these narratives by authoritarian leaders
   operating within the confines of the same regime remains a largely
   unexplored area. I propose that increasing external dependence prompts
   leaders to pivot from ideological to pragmatic legitimation strategies.
   These pragmatic strategies, being more adaptable and less doctrinally
   rigid, allow for adjustments in response to external pressures that
   might otherwise conflict with ideological commitments. Analysing panel
   data on legitimation strategies in authoritarian regimes from 1960 to
   2010, I provide empirical support for this mechanism. The present work
   adds to the growing body of knowledge on adaptation as a survival
   mechanism in authoritarian governance and draws attention to the
   relevance of rational-choice utility-based explanations in interpreting
   the transformation and development of authoritarian regimes.},

Title = {Silencing the Press in Criminal Wars: Why the War on Drugs Turned Mexico
   into the World's Most Dangerous Country for Journalists},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 19},
Abstract = {This article examines the effects of the militarization of public
   security and the conflicts it triggers on a central democratic
   institution: press freedom. We focus on Mexico, which experienced
   multiple waves of assassinations of local journalists after the federal
   government declared a War on Drugs against the country's main cartels
   and deployed the military to the country's most conflictive regions. We
   argue that violence against journalists is tied to the outbreak of
   criminal wars-the multiple localized turf wars and power struggles
   unleashed by the federal military intervention. Subnational politicians
   and their security forces and drug lords are at the center of these
   conflicts because they jointly enable local operations of the
   transnational drug-trafficking industry. To defend their interests, they
   have individual and shared incentives to prevent city- and town-level
   journalists from (or punish them for) publishing fine-grained
   information that may compromise their criminal and political survival
   and their quest for local control. We compiled the most comprehensive
   dataset available on lethal attacks on journalists from 1994 to 2019 to
   test our claims. Using a difference-in-differences design, we show that
   violence against local journalists substantially increased in
   militarized regions, where the military decapitated the cartels and
   fragmented the criminal underworld, triggering violent competition for
   criminal governance-de facto rule over territories, people, and illicit
   economies. Evidence from original focus groups and interviews with
   at-risk reporters suggests that governors, mayors, and their police
   forces possibly joined cartels in murdering journalists to mitigate the
   risks of unwanted information and to minimize the costs of criminal
   governance by silencing the press and society. Our study offers a
   sobering lesson of how the militarization of anti-crime policy and the
   onset of criminal wars can undermine local journalism, press freedom,
   and democracy.},

Abstract = {While conventional wisdom often equates liberalization with
   deregulation, theoretical arguments from different scientific
   backgrounds suggest that states tend to increase their rule stock when
   they adopt more liberal policies. This article studies the case of
   abortion policy to better understand the liberalization-rule nexus. By
   examining data from 25 countries over 50years, we empirically assess the
   dynamics between liberalization events and corresponding regulatory
   changes. Our findings reveal that while the majority of countries does
   indeed introduce more rules upon liberalizing abortion, the extent of
   these regulatory changes varies considerably. The analysis suggests that
   the extent of rule growth depends on the conflicts that characterize
   liberalization processes in particular countries and time periods.
   Right-leaning governments, religious groups and institutional veto
   players are shown to have a positive influence on rule growth. On the
   contrary, higher levels of liberalization reduce the necessity for
   additional rules. By illuminating a contested empirical relationship,
   the article helps to better understand the implications of
   liberalization in modern democracies.},

Abstract = {Many important questions in political science require the use of
   human-coded data or information that has been systematically ordered and
   quantified by a human being from qualitative sources. This article
   discusses challenges and recent innovations in collecting and
   documenting human-coded data. We review five datasets produced within
   the past 10 years and also reflect on our experiences in collecting a
   quarterly dataset that tracked state responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   We argue that scholars can deliberately produce and publish
   theoretically grounded human-coded data in an accessible format that
   promotes transparency, traceability, and readability. We highlight
   several ways that scholars are already doing this, including narratives,
   source lists, and coding justifications that enhance the quality of
   their human-coded datasets. We also discuss common issues during coding
   and how technological innovation through interactive web-based platforms
   can improve the documentation of coding decisions.},

Abstract = {Do presidents go public on cabinet and cabinet-rank nominees? When
   presidents employ a strategy of politicization to appoint their cabinet,
   they may need to push senators to support these nominees through a
   public relations campaign. Thus, a political capital model, where
   presidents offer public support for their nominees to buffer Senate
   opposition, may explain the president's public attention to some
   nominees. Given that cabinet and cabinet-rank nominees are virtually
   assured confirmation, presidents may choose instead to use the
   nomination process to publicize representational characteristics of
   nominees, according to a representation model. To test these models, I
   have collected data on all public mentions of presidential appointments
   to cabinet and cabinet-rank positions from 1965 through 2023. Although
   these nominees enjoy a presumption of success, presidents still devote
   public attention to nominees about whom senators have raised objections
   and when their approval ratings are low. They also emphasize the
   representational quality of diverse nominees, especially for Black
   nominees.},

Abstract = {Quantitative analysis of large-scale political text data in the form of
   word embeddings has great potential for systematising differences
   between political parties. We examine the differences between embeddings
   obtained from speakers from the two competitors for the PM position in
   Sweden (Social Democrats and Moderates) over a 30-year period. The goal
   is to compare how off-the-shelf general pre-trained models perform
   relative to pre-training on a smaller dataset from the same domain. In
   the analysis, we focus on two types of concepts: issues and ideological
   terms. We find that generally, the off-the-shelf pre-trained models lead
   to more reliable results and greater emphasis on ideological differences
   between the studied parties.},

Abstract = {What explains cooperation between armed groups? Challenging existing
   literature that assumes armed groups must be similar or not cooperate at
   all, I argue that explicit differences are key to some cooperation.
   Comparative advantage explains why rebels and criminals-organizations
   that typically eschew collaboration-cooperate to produce violence. This
   article introduces ``black market white labeling{''}-cooperation that
   emerges when one actor buys an illicit good or service from another and
   re-brands it as their own. To demonstrate this phenomenon and the
   conditions under which it occurs, I focus on kidnapping, an
   underexplored but common form of armed group violence. Drawing on 113
   interviews with Colombian kidnappers and hostage recovery personnel from
   Colombia and the United States, I theorize the conditions under which
   rebels ``outsource{''} violence to criminal gangs or produce it ``in
   house.{''} This article explains the organizational dynamics of
   rebel-criminal cooperation that perpetuate violence against civilians.},

Abstract = {In Dialectic of Enlightenment , Horkheimer and Adorno radically
   transform the concept of ``enlightenment{''} forged in the Enlightenment
   movement of the 18th century. They criticized that the concept was based
   on a philosophy of history (in competition with the salvation history of
   Christianity) that was radically contradicted by the historical events
   of the moment. The authors' criticism brings to light the materials
   forgotten by that bourgeois philosophy of history, such as one's own
   body, and allows us to continue the criticism of society with new
   conceptual instruments. Among these, a transformed concept of
   ``enlightenment{''} that recovers its amputated and forgotten
   material-natural moment.},

Abstract = {Dominant visions of modern representative democracy posit that parties
   focus on contrasting issues during campaigns, leading to a diverse
   political supply. However, there is remarkably little empirical evidence
   to back up those claims. We argue that parties have little incentives to
   leave potentially rewarding issues to rivals. Lacking knowledge about
   their electorate and its short-term preferences, parties will monitor
   competitors and take up issues from each other. Empirical analyses
   covering all policy issues in a unique set of seven diverse advanced
   democracies over four decades are consistent with our predictions. Issue
   attention appears to be mostly inspired by rivals' emphases, resulting
   in ``tunnels of attention{''}. The model holds when introducing the
   alternative explanation of responsiveness to voters, corroborating the
   endogenous nature of tunnels of attention. Our new perspective has
   wide-ranging implications for party competition and representation.},

Title = {Measuring libertarian ideology with party manifesto data},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 26},
Abstract = {Libertarian ideology espouses a distinct political project which seeks
   to revolutionise the structures of the liberal democratic state.
   Surprisingly, this radical worldview does occasionally influence
   mainstream right-wing parties, and libertarian ideologues within their
   ranks have, at opportunistic moments, been able to encourage their
   desired policy change. But how can we measure these shifts in
   libertarian ideas within political parties? First, this study explains
   the design of a novel measure for libertarianism using the Manifesto
   Project Database. Second, it will apply this libertarian measure to the
   political parties of the United States and several European countries to
   test its face validity. Finally, the `crucial case' of libertarian ideas
   within the UK Conservative Party will be assessed through the measure.
   This article finds that the libertarian scale provides a valid and
   utilitarian measure for libertarian ideology, which should prompt
   further research.},

Abstract = {Few presidents in Europe have the power to propose legislation directly
   to Parliament. Accordingly, presidential legal initiatives in Europe are
   not very well researched or understood. This paper seeks to address this
   research gap by providing an analysis of presidential legal initiatives
   in Lithuania. We have assembled a dataset of all the presidential legal
   initiatives proposed in Lithuania since 1993. Using this dataset, we
   find that factors in the political environment significantly affect the
   success of presidential legislative initiatives. Additionally, we find
   that the success of these initiatives partly depends on policy content,
   as initiatives in foreign and defense policy, on average, tend to be
   more successful. Lastly, non-partisan presidents in Lithuania become
   more successful over time; our results suggest a consolidation of
   consultation mechanisms between the presidents and the legislature.},

Abstract = {Formal presidential authority does not always translate into real
   influence over policy outcomes: The bureaucratic actors that are
   responsible for policy implementation have considerable discretion.
   Presidents, however, have tools to influence their behavior. In this
   paper, we focus on presidential control of intra-executive information
   flows. We show how the President's power to persuade depends on
   inter-branch relations and intra-branch institutions. We develop a
   theory in which the President can shape information available to
   bureaucratic subordinates via both overt, legitimate channels as well as
   covert, illegitimate interventions. We find that the President's ability
   to persuade bureaucrats to pursue her preferred goals can be reinforced
   by higher bureaucratic independence or more aggressive external
   oversight. We also show how bureaucratic independence mediates how
   overseer motivations translate into oversight intensity. Our theory
   predicts that Congress' investigative resources should target more
   independent agencies under divided government and less independent
   agencies under unified government.},

Abstract = {Politicians use social media to engage directly with the public using
   diverse communication styles including aggressive or uncivil language.
   Yet, little is known about gender differences in politicians'
   communication styles and their subsequent online reactions. In this
   study, we investigate whether women politicians who use critical or
   insulting language on Twitter face disproportionate backlash compared to
   men politicians. To test our hypothesis, we employ a self-developed
   supervised language classifier to categorize @-mentions of
   parliamentarians into two incivility levels: criticism and insults. We
   find that men and women MPs tweet with a similar level of incivility,
   including both critical and insulting language. For critical language,
   we find that both men and women MPs receive more critical responses when
   sending a higher number of critical tweets. In the case of insulting
   language, we find evidence of a gendered pattern: Compared to men MPs,
   women MPs receive a higher number of insulting tweets but can reduce
   such responses to a small degree when being more insulting themselves.
   These findings underscore that female MPs navigate a more hostile online
   environment that compels them to use more insulting language as a means
   of self-defense.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis study aims to enhance treatment completion prediction
   beyond the limitations of traditional logistic regression.MethodsOur
   approach utilizes a two-step machine learning method, integrating
   cross-validation and ensemble modeling to achieve this goal. First, we
   employ a feature selection process using random forest to identify the
   most pivotal variables for our prediction model. Various models are then
   created using common machine learning algorithms, and a stacking
   approach combines the set into an ensemble model. Model selection is
   guided by a comprehensive assessment of performance and practical
   considerations. Our predictive model not only prioritizes accuracy but
   also provides insights into the impact of individual attributes on
   treatment success. By forecasting success, solely using baseline
   characteristics, researchers can assess participants' likelihood of
   completing treatment before it starts, aiding cost reduction, especially
   in resource-intensive programs, by selecting individuals who are more
   likely to complete treatment. Additionally, emphasis on relevant
   variables helps identify areas for improving adherence and commitment to
   the treatment regimen.ResultsOur approach's validation involved a
   thorough assessment using a dataset comprising over 800 real child
   welfare cases, showcasing the practicality and resilience of our
   predictive model. The ensemble model adeptly strikes a balance between
   machine learning models and statistical logistic regression, rendering
   notable improvements in sensitivity and specificity, particularly in
   scenarios marked by imbalanced data.ConclusionThis contribution marks a
   substantial stride forward in the area of enhancing decision-making and
   optimizing resource allocation within treatment program management.},

Abstract = {Partisans hold negative and inaccurate stereotypes of members of the
   out-party. In this paper we test the effectiveness of exposure to
   counter-stereotypical exemplars as a strategy for changing stereotypes
   and reducing partisan animosity. This strategy builds on the
   exemplification theory of stereotype formation, which holds that
   stereotypes of out-groups are constructed from exemplary group members
   that are salient in an individual's memory. Drawing on an established
   experimental paradigm for studying racial stereotypes, we test this
   theory using an experiment that exposes partisans to either
   ideologically stereotypical or ideologically counter-stereotypical
   exemplars of their out-party. This strategy is notably more indirect
   than most strategies tested to reduce affective polarization, which rely
   on directly providing information, often in the form of misperception
   correction, about the distribution of out-party views. Despite this more
   indirect approach, our results suggest that exposure to
   counter-stereotypical exemplars can moderate stereotypes of partisan
   ideology and improve affect towards the out-party, relative to exposure
   to stereotypical exemplars. These results have important implications
   for our understanding of how negative and inaccurate views of the
   out-party form, and also suggest methods for reducing partisan
   animosity.},

Title = {To empower or constrain? How emergent interest representation
   transformed workers' collective action in South China},
Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 13},
Abstract = {It is commonly assumed that the best way to strengthen workers' voice in
   authoritarian contexts such as China is through the institutionalisation
   of collective interest representation. This article argues that this
   assumption oversimplifies and exaggerates the gains that can be
   expected, particularly when workers have previous experience in taking
   other forms of collective action. Revisiting the aftermath of the
   watershed 2010 strike wave in South China, it shows that trade union and
   collective bargaining reforms have had two constraining effects for
   workers. First, they were designed to curb rank-and-file activism; and
   second, they forced worker representatives to moderate their demands and
   practices. The article argues that these constraints are inherent in
   collective interest representation. In doing so, it challenges the
   prevailing consensus that collective interest representation strengthens
   labour voice in China, and two derived assumptions: the attribution of
   constraints on workers' voice to authoritarianism; and the inferiority
   of autonomous forms of collective action to collective interest
   representation. These challenges are contextually supported by the
   failure of trade union and collective bargaining reforms to match the
   material and institutional gains achieved by workers' autonomous action
   during the status ante. The article suggests that collective interest
   representation should be assigned a more modest role in the pursuit of
   labour voice, and that research should instead be recalibrated towards
   the study of different forms, logics and effects of workers' collective
   action.},

Abstract = {This study provides a comparative analysis of the 12345 public service
   hotlines in Beijing and Shanghai, the two largest cities in China.
   Although similar in size, these cities have implemented distinct
   data-driven innovation strategies. Beijing has taken a more ambitious
   approach, marked by substantial resource allocation and increased
   departmental capacity. This strategy delegates decision-making and
   responsibility to grassroots governments while introducing a performance
   ranking system to incentivize local officials. In contrast, Shanghai has
   adopted a more moderate approach, integrating the hotline into its
   broader data-driven governance framework, characterized by greater
   flexibility and potential applicability to smaller cities across China.
   These findings suggest that ambitious data-driven innovation initiatives
   may result in a siphon effect in the citizen request handling process,
   where government departments channel additional responsibilities into
   the hotline, increasing its complexity and workload. This effect may
   hinder the hotline's core function, especially for lower-level
   grassroots governments. Heightened top-down performance pressure could
   exacerbate this issue, potentially compromising the effectiveness of
   these services.},

Abstract = {The open release of ChatGPT in late 2022 sent the world of education
   into a frenzy. Popular media outlets both sang the praises of generative
   AI and also posed questions about what generative AI meant for the
   future of teaching and learning. In the year that has followed, we have
   seen a broad range of strategies for managing generative AI on campuses
   ranging from total bans to open embrace and encouragement. As such, many
   instructors feel lost and unguided in how to approach generative AI in
   their classrooms. In response to lack of clarity on direction or
   alternatives, an increasing number of administrators and instructors are
   considering bans on generative AI tools. In this article, we offer a set
   of considerations about the landscape of generative AI in classroom and
   work settings followed by a set of three models (high, medium, and low
   use) instructors can use in small, medium, and large classrooms to
   navigate AI in a higher education setting.},

Title = {Do voters polarise in response to elite dissensus on immigration?},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 1},
Abstract = {While much of the existing research on public opinion about immigration
   focuses on anti-immigrant sentiment, less is known about voter
   polarisation on this issue and its determinants. This article examines
   the conditions under which elite polarisation, a factor shown in
   previous research to shape public opinion on a variety of issues,
   impacts voter polarisation on immigration. To this end, it employs a
   two-pronged empirical strategy. First, it exploits variation in
   individual attitudes and elite stances across countries and over time
   (2002-2019). Second, it employs individual panel data analyses and an
   instrumental variable approach, respectively. The results reveal little
   evidence that voters polarise in response to growing elite dissensus,
   except after elections with a radical right party breakthrough in the
   national parliament. Instead, some evidence suggests that elite
   polarisation may in fact depolarise non-partisan voters in remaining
   elections. These results have important implications for understanding
   mass-elite linkages on socio-cultural issues.},

Abstract = {The article examines the key factors influencing women's electoral
   success in European Parliament (EP) elections. We present a new
   conceptual approach and a novel model that simultaneously incorporates
   trends in party characteristics, institutional and socio-economic
   factors and cross-country trends in women's representation. The model
   provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between party-
   level and Member State-level factors and the election of women to the
   EP. The study is based on an original dataset of 450 observations on
   national political parties from all Member States, spanning four
   European elections from 2004 to 2019. Our results show that party
   characteristics such as incumbency rates, party size and ideological
   orientations (i.e. the party's position on the GAL-TAN scale or its
   attitude towards European integration) play a key role in shaping
   women's representation. This article provides novel insights into the
   unique features of Central and Eastern Europe, elucidating divergent
   patterns of women's electoral prospects in conservative and progressive
   parties in Western democracies and Central and Eastern European post-
   communist EU Member States.},

Abstract = {School board candidates supported by local teachers' unions
   overwhelmingly win, and we examine the causes and consequences of the
   ``teachers' union premium{''} in these elections. First, we show that
   union endorsement information increases voter support. Although the
   magnitude of this effect varies across ideological and partisan
   subgroups, an endorsement rarely hurts a candidate's prospects with the
   electorate. Second, we benchmark the size of the endorsement premium to
   other well-known determinants of vote choice in local elections. Perhaps
   surprisingly, we show the effect can be as large as the impact of shared
   partisanship, and substantially larger than the boost from endorsements
   provided by other stakeholders. Finally, examining real-world
   endorsement decisions, we find that union support for incumbents hinges
   on self-interested pecuniary considerations and is unaffected by
   performance in improving student academic outcomes. The divergence
   between what endorsements mean and how voters interpret them has
   troubling normative democratic implications.},

Abstract = {Can public diplomacy in times of crisis shape citizens' attitudes
   towards international politics? Using a survey experiment in Italy, we
   evaluated whether information cues about public diplomacy efforts by the
   United States and China to assist the country in dealing with the
   COVID-19 emergency shifted the importance citizens attached to Italy's
   international allies being democracies. We found that citizens who
   receive positive cues about USA efforts to assist Italy report a
   stronger preference for Italy interacting with democracies. At the same
   time, when they received positive cues about China's efforts to assist
   Italy, they discounted the importance attached to international allies
   being democracies. We further found that these effects are conditional
   on the participants' support for democracy at home. We argue that these
   findings are consistent with a cognitive dissonance framework where
   citizens update their attitudes to decrease dissonant cognitions when
   they receive information that challenges prior beliefs or expectations.},

Abstract = {Whether fiscal austerity by governments is unpopular or not is much
   discussed in the literature. One line of research argues that
   consolidation has negative electoral effects, ranging from declines in
   politicians' approval ratings to abstention by voters at elections.
   Another strand highlights that re-election chances are not harmed by the
   implementation of austerity and that some voters in fact support
   consolidation measures. Both sides are limited in at least two regards.
   First, they do not allow for the possibility that public opinion is
   shaped by the political discussion about government debts and budget
   deficits. Second, and relatedly, the literature is limited in its extent
   to which it considers heterogeneity in preference adaptation across
   income groups. This article contributes to these debates by bringing to
   bear insights from the literature on mass preference formation. In
   particular, I argue that a cross-party consensus on austerity leads
   voters to align their preferences with the consensus, increasingly
   demanding cuts to government spending. This adaptation is conditioned by
   income so that the preferences of those income groups that are the
   furthest away from the consensus adapt their fiscal preferences most. By
   including the discursive context of fiscal policy, this article helps
   explain how austerity can be made popular. Empirically, I test these
   expectations by matching citizen preferences with party positions on
   fiscal policy for 60 country years. The empirical results indeed
   demonstrate that even though low- and middle-income voters are least
   supportive of austerity, they adapt the most to the party consensus on
   austerity.},

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen a surge of politicians campaigning on policies
   that aim to deter asylum applicants. We present a game-theoretic model
   in which foreign nationals consider applying for asylum and bureaucrats
   decide their case if they apply. We show that while policies that make
   the asylum application less attractive decrease the probability that
   foreign nationals apply, they also endogenously raise the credibility of
   applicants' claims to political persecution and, therefore, may not
   decrease the number of admitted refugees. Investigating how these
   competing effects shape asylum policy-making, we show how policy choices
   depend on bureaucrats' leniency and politicians' objectives. Our
   analysis speaks to the causes of restrictive asylum policies and their
   limited effectiveness in reducing immigration.},

Abstract = {Does the media enhance issue accountability? Many argue it does by
   covering where politicians stand on policy. However, evidence of this
   process is limited and fails to address two alternatives. First, when
   informed about an issue by the media, people may change their own issue
   stance so it aligns with a politician they already support. Second, the
   public may ignore the news when it conflicts with party loyalty. We
   distinguish these alternatives using survey experiments and
   observational studies of local media and the public's use of issues to
   evaluate their members of Congress from 2006 to 2022. Across these
   settings local news increases the public's reliance on policy to
   evaluate politicians, affirming the media's contribution to issue
   accountability despite heightened polarization. These studies also
   highlight a mechanism behind this, showing news primarily changes views
   of legislators by reducing widespread uncertainty about their policy
   positions.},

Abstract = {The UK-based City of Sanctuary movement claims to create welcoming
   conditions for those who had to flee their homes. Despite the
   well-documented efforts to integrate migrants, refugees and asylum
   seekers at a local level, the movement's practices have been criticised
   by scholars as reproducing government-prescribed passivity and exclusion
   of these groups. Through document analysis and participant observation
   in a Borough of Sanctuary group in London, we examined the City of
   Sanctuary's self-representation and mobilisation practices and how
   participation of sanctuary seekers is discussed and enacted by those
   involved. We found that the movement's institutional collaborations have
   led to an increased professionalisation of the movement which on the one
   hand offers greater impact and on the other hand risk excluding the very
   groups the movement is advocating for. Yet by providing material and
   institutional spaces to enable participation and citizenship, the
   movement ensures migrants can assert their rightful presence, achieving
   greater participation as well as amplifying migrants' voices within and
   beyond the movement.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the system of secrecy in Mexico considering the
   Right to information as set forth in Article 6 of its Constitution. The
   paper examines the reasons justifying information secrecy, the
   authorities empowered to assess such secrecy, the procedures for its
   implementation, and the criteria obligating disclosure. Additionally, it
   addresses two specific aspects of the Mexican system: the nature of
   information incompatible with classification and the use of the harm
   test as an argumentative tool to balance the legal interests at stake.
   Without intending to draw direct comparisons, this study suggests some
   considerations that could be relevant for a potential reform of the
   official secrets system in Spain.},

Title = {A neglected turning-point? The 1985 Northern Irish local elections and
   the transformation of Irish republicanism},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The emergence of the political party Sinn F \& eacute;in as an electoral
   force, and its gradual displacement of the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
   as the primary vehicle for Provisional Irish republicanism, was an
   indispensable precondition for the peace process that brought an end to
   the long-running Northern Irish `Troubles'. Unsurprisingly, this process
   has been a subject of close academic scrutiny, with much attention
   focusing on the dramatic, early breakthroughs made by Sinn F \&
   eacute;in, particularly in the years 1981-1983. By contrast, the
   mid-to-late 1980s are often represented as something of a fallow period
   for the party, when its initial, seemingly meteoric rise stalled. Within
   this narrative, the 1985 local elections are typically passed over
   relatively quickly. Yet this article makes the case for revisiting those
   elections, seeing them as marking a somewhat under-appreciated political
   earthquake in Northern Ireland. It does so on the basis that first, the
   elections laid bare the ambiguities and tensions arising from the Irish
   republican movement's `Armalite and Ballot box' strategy. And second,
   the consequences of the 1985 elections proved decisive in reshaping both
   Irish republicanism and the wider political landscape of Northern
   Ireland.},

Abstract = {This article critically addresses charges of obsolescence of the law of
   value by autonomist scholars within the postoperaist tradition, a
   prominent perspective within Marxist theory that has sparked
   considerable debate and discussion. Drawing primarily upon the
   Grundrisse, the thesis advanced by the autonomists suggests an imminent
   crisis of the law of value due to the introduction of the ``general
   intellect{''} into the production process, thereby undermining
   traditional mechanisms for measuring value and thus, exploitation. This
   article incorporates the most insightful contributions from
   value-informed Marxian scholars to assess the autonomist thesis of the
   growing obsolescence of the law of value. This article also situates the
   premise of the crisis of value in relation to Marx's own work,
   particularly his economic writings throughout his adult life. By doing
   so, this article systematize the most fundamental misinterpretations,
   tensions, inconsistencies, and contradictions within their theoretical
   framework, highlighting the ongoing relevance of Marx's value theory for
   interpreting recent transformations in the world of work.},

Abstract = {In this article the author answers the question from the title - Is the
   cultural left liberal? In contemporary debates which flared up after
   Trump's victory in 2016, the ideological position of Hilary Clinton was
   questioned by numerous writers. Mark Lilla calls it identity liberalism.
   The author argues that identity left should be distinguished from
   liberalism because it is by self-understanding illiberal. The argument
   in the paper is organised in four segments. After a brief presentation
   of the concepts of liberalism and cultural left, the author focuses on
   Lilla's criticism of identity liberalism and compares it with John
   Gray's criticism of hyper-liberalism. These two writers are discussed
   with the help of two classics of contemporary political thought: Richard
   Rorty and Brian Barry. In the concluding segment the author argues that
   the postmodern identity left should never be called liberal because it
   is openly antiliberal, and demonstrates how Barry's prophecy from 1989
   and Rorty's from 1998 came true.},

Title = {A contract law approach to private censorship of art on social media
   platforms},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Number = {41},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The censorship of artists on social media impacts their freedom of
   expression and their ability to monetize and engage with their
   audiences. Furthermore, this fosters a process of cultural
   standardization. Several legal arguments have been raised against art
   censorship in social media platforms, mainly based on public law,
   however, they are not effective in all jurisdictions, as demonstrated by
   U.S. case law. The purpose of this paper is to shift the spotlight and
   provide solutions from a private law perspective, specifically from
   contract law. The main argument here is that courts should abandon their
   traditional bilateral/vertical approach and embrace a more nuanced one
   that better reflects the complexity of the relationships taking place in
   social media. This would give those affected access to concrete
   contractual remedies and allow for greater control over the content
   moderation process.},

Abstract = {This article challenges the common assumption that the partisan
   identification of bureaucratic elites is fixed over time. Building on
   principal-agent and organization theory, we hypothesize that
   bureaucratic elites may respond to political turnover by adjusting their
   partisan identification toward that of their (new) elected principals.
   We test this prediction using data from the American State
   Administrators Project (ASAP) over the 1964-2008 period, which allows us
   to study the same US agency leaders (N=951 individuals) before and after
   partisan shifts in their agency's elected principals. We find
   significant evidence that agency leaders remaining in office following a
   shift in the party in power on average reorient their partisan identity
   in response to such turnover events. These adjustments are stronger for
   agency leaders directly appointed by, or in more frequent contact with,
   their elected principals. Our results suggest a malleability of
   partisanship seldom attributed to bureaucratic elites in public and
   academic discourse.},

Abstract = {Why do some countries pass laws to reduce emissions that cause climate
   change while others do not? We theorize that climate change-related
   disasters cause politicians to view global warming as more proximate,
   but whether they have incentives to enact mitigation laws depends on
   their country's geographic vulnerability to future damages. We use a
   spatial integrated assessment model to measure global warming's local
   economic effects, which allows us to predict how political leaders
   respond to disasters based on their vulnerability. An analysis of
   mitigation laws from 1990-2020 in 155 countries shows that only
   governments in locations facing the greatest future climate damage react
   to disasters by passing mitigation policies. Distinct from the
   historical North-South divide, our findings highlight a growing
   geographic cleavage in national responses to climate change.},

Abstract = {Recent research has uncovered positive connections between parties'
   center-periphery and climate policy preferences when they compete in
   regional elections, with pro-periphery parties using climate concerns to
   bolster their territorial claims. However, the particular significance
   of climate change at the regional level, due to its more direct impacts
   in this arena, raises questions about the extent to which these parties
   replicate similar behaviors in national elections. To address this gap,
   this article analyzes the manifestos of parties that secured
   representation during the 2016 and 2019 Spanish general elections, as
   well as in the regional elections held during overlapping periods in
   Catalonia (2017 and 2021) and the Basque Country (2016 and 2020). The
   empirical findings reveal that parties with stronger
   pro-decentralization and pro-independence stances allocate more content
   to climate change and adopt more favorable positions on this issue in
   their regional manifestos compared to their national counterparts.},

Abstract = {In most federations, the division of power between central and
   subnational governments represents an important cleavage dividing voters
   and structuring party systems. Yet we lack a robust body of research
   regarding individuals' preferences for different forms of devolved
   decision-making such as decentralization and asymmetrical federalism.
   This article contributes to this research agenda by analyzing the
   effects of identity and grievances on public opinion toward the division
   of powers in Canada. Leveraging four waves of the Confederation of
   Tomorrow survey, we find that respondents who identify predominantly
   with their province are more likely to prefer decentralization and
   asymmetrical federalism, whereas those who hold grievances against the
   federation prefer decentralization. Studying provincial variations in
   the impact of our main variables, we point to the role of the political
   context by showing that in certain provinces, the political mobilization
   of grievances strengthens the relationship between provincial identity
   and support for decentralization.},

Abstract = {Germany is implementing the ``Energiewende{''} (energy transition): it
   has completed the phase-out of nuclear energy and plans to phase out
   coal-fired power generation by 2038 at the latest. The expansion of
   renewable energies is thus an imperative task and wind energy capacity
   must be increased significantly. However, wind energy expansion has
   slumped massively since 2018 and is only slowly catching up. Various
   reasons for this gap between necessity and reality are proposed, with
   citizens' referendums on local decisions as well as lawsuits brought by
   Environmental Non-Governmental Organisations (ENGOs) against approval
   decisions being relevant obstacles. However, data on how these projects
   challenge wind energy expansion is lacking so far. The article addresses
   this gap and examines how, to what extent, and with what effect these
   procedures are used by opponents of wind energy projects. Focusing on
   Hesse as a state where both procedures are used comparatively often, the
   article takes stock conceptually and empirically of their role and
   impact, drawing on secondary literature and initial collections of
   descriptive primary data to look at how these procedures result in
   producing obstacles to local wind energy expansion. Findings from case
   studies suggest that both procedures may hinder wind energy expansion
   even if, in formally legal terms, they are not ultimately successful.
   From the perspective of local opponents of specific wind energy
   projects, this offers the possibility of ``failing successfully{''}.},

Title = {Choice Overload in Crowded Primary Elections},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {53},

Pages = {3-16},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The number of candidates running in U.S. primary elections is
   increasing. Contested primary elections force voters to decide between
   candidates that share party labels and are ideologically similar.
   Similar to contexts of non-partisan elections, an increase in the number
   of candidates should exacerbate the cognitive demand of voting in
   primary elections. We expect large candidate fields in primaries make
   voters (1) spend less time looking at each candidate profile, (2) more
   likely to abstain, (3) more likely to vote based on ballot position, and
   (4) more likely to feel overwhelmed with the decision. All four of these
   expectations were preregistered. We test the effect of large candidate
   fields on voter behavior using a survey experiment (n = 2000) fielded by
   YouGov. We find large candidate fields cause respondents to spend less
   time looking at candidate profiles, to select candidates in the first
   half of the ballot, and to feel overwhelmed by the decision-making
   process. In contrast to our expectations, we find large candidate fields
   make respondents less likely to abstain.},

Title = {Boycott and Buycott Intent to Actions: Unpacking the Role of Political
   Ideology and Advertising Through The Society of the Spectacle},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 5},
Abstract = {This study investigates the interaction between political ideology and
   consumer behavior regarding the intentions and actions of boycotts and
   buycotts. Using a quantitative approach with 408 surveys analyzed using
   PLS-SEM and focusing on Society of Spectacle Theory, we examined how
   communicative tactics and media representations, particularly in
   advertising, affect consumer intentions and actions. This analysis
   focuses on Puerto Rico, a unique context in which microideologies
   significantly influence consumers' decisions. These results contribute
   to the understanding of the role of political ideology in brand
   activism, highlighting how it becomes a consumable image through
   advertising. Interestingly, the findings reveal an inclination of Puerto
   Rican consumers toward buycotts rather than boycotts, contrasting with
   global trends that favor more boycotts, explained by political
   polarization. This research not only fills a significant gap in studies
   on the interaction between political ideology and consumer behavior but
   also offers valuable insights into how ideological representations in
   the entertainment society influence political consumption actions.},

Abstract = {Emerging scholarship on the EU and Russia's full-scale invasion of
   Ukraine on 24 February 2022 has predominantly focused on explaining the
   unprecedented strength of the EU's response, especially its new
   far-reaching sanctions against Russia and the granting of a candidate
   country status to all three Eastern Neighbours. What is missing from the
   picture is the role of pre-war EU-Ukraine external differentiated
   integration (EDI) arrangements in the EU's efforts to support the
   country's resilience amidst the war. Based on the case studies of the
   EU's Solidarity Lanes initiative and Eurojust's assistance with the
   documentation and investigation of Russia's war crimes in Ukraine, the
   article highlights the role and potential of EDI as a crisis management
   and post-war recovery tool. It also points to the repercussions of
   EU-Ukraine EDI for the EU's further evolution as an external actor,
   particularly in the domains of crisis response, crisis management, and
   long-term recovery.},

Journal = {RUSSIAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {This study delves into the identities and motivations of members,
   specifically focusing on the human rights organization, of Perviy Otdel
   (First Department). Amid escalating tensions and the outbreak of war,
   these activists find themselves navigating the challenges of addressing
   politically-charged court cases related to state treason in Russia, all
   while operating from abroad due to increased risks and threats. Drawing
   from the theoretical lenses of transnational activism and an
   identity-based paradigm, our research unpacks the complex dynamics of
   activism in exile. Through a discourse analysis of ten semi-structured
   interviews with Perviy Otdel members spanning various hierarchical
   positions, research uncovers how the war and subsequent displacement
   have reshaped their professional and personal identities. The findings
   illuminate the unwavering commitment of these activists-in-exile to the
   cause of human rights and offer insights into the evolving landscape of
   global human rights advocacy in the face of geopolitical challenges.},

Abstract = {China's growing involvement in trade and foreign investments across
   Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) has impacted regional countries'
   relations with the United States, the traditionally dominant power. In
   the case of Mexico, China is expanding its presence in the Mexican
   economy, which could either strengthen or complicate the Mexico-U.S.
   relationship. The paper aims to examine the impact of China's role in
   the Mexican economy within the framework of Mexico-U.S. Ties and the
   U.S.-China trade war. It argues that the trade war augments Mexico's
   participation in the U.S. market through the U.S.-Mexico-Canada
   Agreement (USMCA). The empirical analysis demonstrates that Mexico has
   leveraged the U.S.-China trade war under the new rules established by
   the USMCA. The new rules of origin and labor provisions give Mexico a
   greater advantage in accessing the U.S. market and enhance the country's
   appeal to foreign companies for nearshoring, despite the asymmetrical
   nature of Mexico-U.S. relations. Meanwhile, rather than hindering
   Mexico-China trade, the prohibition stipulated in the USMCA against
   signing a trade agreement with a non-market economy has helped expand
   trade links between the two countries.},

Abstract = {Do the electoral constraints imposed by two-party systems make citizens
   less likely to defect from undemocratic candidates? I employ two
   innovative candidate choice experiments fielded in England to answer
   this question. Specifically, I implement two designs manipulating the
   number and effective number of parties displayed between two and three,
   exploiting England's party system characteristics. Contrary to
   expectations, I find that Labour and Conservative identifiers do not
   defect more from undemocratic in-partisan candidates when they face
   three (effective) parties-Labour, the Conservatives, and the Liberal
   Democrats-rather than just the two major parties. Instead, defection
   from undemocratic in-partisans to the out-party drops and relocates to
   the Liberal Democrats, even when the latter have no chance of winning.
   These findings highlight that having three parties does not generate
   more defection from undemocratic politicians and, consequently, does not
   reduce risks of democratic backsliding through this mechanism.},

Journal = {PS-POLITICAL SCIENCE \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {57},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article illuminates a fundamental problem at the core of canonical
   political theory: the racialization of knowledge. It contends that the
   history of canonical thought as being necessarily Western and,
   therefore, European American, means the emergence of epistemic racism
   produces enormous consequences for the practice of philosophical
   thought-namely, Africana political theory (APT). Thus, this article
   raises important questions such as the colonization of reason, as well
   as the ongoing relationship between political theory and race, such that
   the specter of anti-black racism manifests and becomes intertwined with
   the foundations of the canon. Ultimately, the article proffers APT as
   decolonial critique to complicate and expand the parameters of
   philosophical practice. The overall consequences for the discipline, its
   students, and its practitioners actualize an ongoing movement for black
   liberation.},

Abstract = {Local context has been shown to influence political attitudes and
   behaviors. We extend this research to argue that when a party performs
   better in a voter's region or the region is more competitive, she will
   have more information on the parties and be better able to correctly
   identify the party's positions. In addition, we argue that the strategy
   the party takes will also have an effect. To test our argument, we
   combine individual- and party-level data from the Comparative Study of
   Electoral Systems and data on the party's regional electoral performance
   from the European NUTS-Level Electoral Database from 1996 to 2021 for
   five federal or quasi-federal West European countries. Our results
   confirm our expectations. Our findings have important implications for
   understanding the multilevel nature of representation more generally,
   and how a voter's local context shapes how she perceives parties'
   positions and how parties can use local context to their advantage, more
   specifically.},

Abstract = {This article aims to contribute to the debate on the persistent gap in
   political engagement between Western European (WE) and post-communist
   Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. The present analysis
   focuses on the case of non-institutionalized political engagement. Based
   on a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, it is argued
   that the perception of social injustice is one reason this gap between
   WE and CEE still exists. Based on grievance theory and the concept of
   relative deprivation, the article posits that perceptions of injustice
   motivate non-institutionalized political engagement in WE countries but
   very little in countries of the CEE region.},

Abstract = {In liberal democracies, the very essence of political science is to be a
   critical friend. It is both legitimate and rewarding to engage in policy
   relevant studies. It is not banal, technocratic, or oppressive to do
   research into pressing social issues and to provide advice on the
   effectiveness or desirability of policy interventions, or to evaluate
   existing policy programmes. And is not a Faustian bargain to train
   thousands of students each year to become professional policy advisors,
   civil servants, and politicians. On the contrary, well-trained civil
   servants and policy staff are crucial for the vitality and survival of
   liberal democracies. What matters, both for the individual scholar and
   at the disciplinary level, is the right balance between hands-on
   practical impact and critical distance.},

Abstract = {In political science, teaching quantitative methods can pose challenges
   due to students' apprehensions and perceptions of the content, the
   complexity of the material, and the significant time commitment required
   from instructors. I advocate for adopting collaborative final projects
   in quantitative methods courses to mitigate these challenges. A
   comparative case study analysis is implemented to examine quantitative
   courses with a collaborative final research project to those with an
   individual project in two countries: Finland and the United States.
   There was a noticeable decrease in student anxiety and instructor's time
   commitments and an increase in student success and favorable feedback
   toward the course and instruction. Overall, adoption of collaborative
   learning into quantitative methods courses can be mutually beneficial
   for both students and instructors.},

Abstract = {Whilst there are significant electoral advantages for political parties
   to target women's votes, scholarship on recent electoral appeals
   questions the quality of gendered policy promises to address deep
   structural gender inequalities existing within the British state. This
   article examines British Election Study data to identify women voters'
   concerns and explores how the two largest Westminster parties developed
   appeals to women voters in the build up to the 2024 UK general election
   through an analysis of leadership speeches to the 2023 party
   conferences. We find a disconnect between women's electoral demands to
   address class-based gender inequalities and party attempts to
   `weaponize' the woman question around status issues. We conclude by
   pointing to the enduring nature of gendered inequalities despite the
   election of a Labour government, which targeted appeals more closely to
   the class-based concerns of women voters.},

Abstract = {For decades, the Parti socialiste (PS) was the major party of the French
   left. It elected a president three times and was a ruling party on
   several occasions between 1981 and 2017, at which point it suffered
   crushing defeats in the 2017 presidential and legislative elections.
   Since then, the PS has been between a rock and a hard place: on the
   left, it is dominated by Jean-Luc Melenchon's La France Insoumise (LFI,
   Unbowed France) and on the right by Macron's Renaissance party. The
   success of both parties has a lot to do with the PS's own setbacks.
   Emmanuel Macron's election in 2017 was rendered possible by internal
   conflicts in the PS during Francois Hollande's term. Those who thought
   that Benoit Hamon's candidacy was too left-wing that year, or those who
   now regard an alliance with Melenchon as `illegitimate', found refuge in
   Macron's party. This article aims to explain the reasons for the PS's
   dramatic setbacks and to explore its prospects for recovery.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the relationship dynamics between local government
   bureaucratic elites and political elites in Nabire Regency, Papua
   Province, using a quantitative approach with observation and
   questionnaires. The research reveals that the Regional Development
   Planning Agency (Bappeda) contributes significantly (83.1\%) to the
   development planning process, indicating a strong technocratic
   influence. However, Bappeda faces challenges including unprofessional
   human resource management, limited budget and infrastructure, poor
   administrative organization, and inadequate planning and implementation
   of communityfocused development programs. Local elites also exert a
   significant positive influence (78.7\%) on the development planning
   process. Their role is characterized by the politicization of special
   autonomy, representation politics concerning poverty and resource
   management, Papuanization politics focusing on local empowerment, and
   the coastal-highlands dichotomy affecting development distribution. The
   study highlights the complex interplay between bureaucratic efficiency
   and local political dynamics in shaping regional development. It
   underscores the need for improved resource management, better
   administrative practices, and more inclusive planning processes. The
   findings also emphasize the importance of addressing political issues
   such as special autonomy, representation, and regional divisions to
   ensure equitable and effective development in Nabire Regency.},

Abstract = {Rhetorical entrapment plays a key - but often overlooked - role in the
   theory and practice of international relations. In this article, we
   develop a new pathway and mechanisms of rhetorical entrapment. Our key
   argument is that current literature has focused too much on normative
   forms of rhetorical entrapment. Although insightful, this misses
   empirical forms of rhetorical entrapment. Drawing on Habermasian theory,
   we suggest that normative and empirical validity claims give rise to
   alternate pathways and mechanisms of rhetorical entrapment: the
   normative pathway encapsulates framing, identity and legitimacy; whereas
   the empirical pathway is mediated by information, reputation and trust.
   To explore this theoretical argument, we engage in a plausibility probe
   of international investment agreement negotiations. Drawing upon
   in-depth interviews with various state negotiators, we find that
   empirical rhetorical entrapment is pervasive. We document this pathway
   and mechanisms. We conclude by developing the broader causal and
   normative implications of our argument.},

Abstract = {Peace agreements can be more effective and durable when being supported
   by the broad public through a peace referendum. However, after some
   peace negotiations, No-campaigns succeeded in convincing voters that the
   peace in question was not the right solution. This study seeks to
   advance the discussion of campaign support in peace referendums by
   studying the design and content of No-campaigns, in relation to their
   Yes-counterparts, and their role in gathering support against peace
   agreements. We argue that No-campaigns can become a risk to peace
   agreements when they employ a coherent strategy where its different
   elements such as organisation, logistics, and methodologies are
   integrated cohesively, and where they offer a unified content in terms
   of the message addressed to the public. These two aims are more
   difficult to accomplish for Yes-campaigns. We study this argument for
   the cases of the peace referendums in Northern Ireland in 1998 and
   Colombia in 2016.},

Title = {Measuring Belief Certainty in Political Knowledge},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Abstract = {Political knowledge measures what people know and how they reason about
   politics, but scholars still debate how to best measure the concept. A
   growing body of survey research has demonstrated the theoretical
   importance of measuring an individual's expressed belief certainty about
   their own informedness. Yet existing political knowledge measures
   typically fail to recover this information. This article validates a
   question format that allows respondents to express their level of
   certainty in their knowledge about politics and government. The analyses
   show that the certainty-in-knowledge format: (1) reduces systematic
   differences between men and women in responding ``Don't Know,{''} and
   (2) decreases answer look-up on online surveys. Validity, reliability,
   and information analyses further demonstrate that incorporating belief
   certainty results in a knowledge scale that displays theoretically
   expected relationships with a range of outcome variables while also
   having superior psychometric properties. Additionally, the
   certainty-in-knowledge format eliminates the confounding influence of
   response option cues and can be applied to questions on any
   topic-political figures, institutional rules, policies, and surveillance
   facts. This shift in measurement can be made without costly changes to
   survey questionnaire design and length. Finally, the new format
   represents a more realistic conception of citizen competence: one that
   elevates the ability of discerning true from false political
   information.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how Russian citizens use nonpolitical civic
   activities to dissent against the war in Ukraine, based on James Scott's
   idea of silent resistance. By studying a Telegram group helping
   Ukrainian war refugees, it explores the motivations and reasons for
   individuals' involvement. The paper shows that loyal civic activism can
   be a form of opposition when protest or emigration is not possible. It
   highlights new trends in Russian civil society's anti-war initiatives
   since the war began, emphasizing the rise of grassroots non-formalized
   activism amid increasing political repression and the decline of
   democracy under Putin.},

Abstract = {Studies focusing on Belize reveal that clientelism is the glue that
   makes the party system stick. We explore whether ideology and ethnicity
   account for partisanship within that deeply clientelist setting. We use
   four AmericasBarometer survey waves by the Latin American Public Opinion
   Project (LAPOP) to study the individual-level correlates of partisan
   attachments with the People's United Party (PUP) and United Democratic
   Party (UDP). Using binary and multinomial probit maximum likelihood
   estimators, we find that ethnicity correlates to partisanship with the
   PUP, and ideology correlates to partisanship with the UDP. The
   robustness checks, which focus on declared vote choices in previous
   national elections, corroborate our findings. The Belizean case shows
   how clientelist parties can develop alternative support sources and that
   these can vary substantially.},

Abstract = {Coordinative Europeanisation is a powerful frame to explain the rapid
   response of EU institutions in times of permanent emergency. So far,
   though, little is known about sub-national actors' role in this process.
   Moving away from a state-centric approach, this article investigates the
   role of sub-national actors through the case study of the digital
   provision of services to asylum seekers. Given the field's high salience
   and state-centric nature, this article elucidates the critical role of
   European sub-national actors, particularly at the municipality level, to
   accelerate the digital provision of services to refugees. Comparing 3
   European cities (Paris, Palermo and Malaga), we argue that sub-national
   actors can play a role in coordinative Europeanisation and that 2 main
   mechanisms may enable it. In the cases observed, discursive coordination
   around humanitarian duty facilitated the emergence of similar digital
   solutions across countries. Subsequently, horizontal and vertical
   networking was used by sub-national actors to legitimise their actions
   and enhance their anchoring in processes of coordinative
   Europeanisation.},

Abstract = {Popular Hindi cinema in contemporary times has characteristic patterns
   of ideological positioning, that reflect the populist authoritarian
   regime and its political agenda of a monolithic Hindu identity with its
   corresponding political version of a nation built on Hindutva policies.
   Film genres like historicals have been ideal propaganda vehicles in
   building counternarratives to challenge the fragile secular structures
   that keep the heterogeneity of the nation in place. A sub-genre to be
   mentioned in this context is biopics which have emerged as a popular
   sub-genre of historicals in contemporary Indian cinema. They narrate
   tales of individuals who have led extraordinary lives or have shaped
   their lives to become role models for the young to learn and emulate.
   Biopics can be turned into narratives about nationalism with little
   effort and we see several films shaping discourses on nationalism and
   national identity. Using biopics released since 2010, I seek to explore
   the significance of this hero in biopics in a neoliberal nationalist
   paradigm. The films chosen are those that depict the lives of common
   people who have turned heroes, as in the case of films like Manjhi - The
   Mountain Man (2015), Super 30 (2019), and Pad Man (2018).},

   Erwartung.
   While voting by mail is more convenient than voting in person, it is
   more complex and therefore more prone to error. This research note
   examines the extent to which this barrier has a negative impact on the
   composition of the electorate. It is argued that the higher complexity
   does not affect all voters equally, but that socially disadvantaged
   groups tend to make disproportionately more errors when voting by mail,
   leading to the rejection of the mail ballot. Consequently, voting by
   mail contributes to an exacerbation of the existing social selectivity
   of voter participation. We analyse this relation using small-scale data
   from the city of Bremen, which confirm these expectations.

Abstract = {Few federal agencies have generated more controversy than the small
   Office for Civil Rights (OCR) in the Department of Education. From
   desegregation and bilingual education to intercollegiate athletics,
   sexual harassment, and transgender rights, it has turned short civil
   rights statutes into lengthy administrative rules. It thus offers a
   useful window into what has become known as ``the administrative
   state.{''} But this window is far from transparent: OCR rarely uses
   standard Administrative Procedure Act rulemaking, opting instead for
   unilateral ``Dear Colleague Letters{''} written with little external
   participation; the bulk of its resources are devoted to investigation of
   individual complaints, with little public explanation of the outcomes.
   Innovation and expansion of the agency's mission has not come from the
   permanent bureaucracy, but from the courts and from agency leaders
   appointed by the president. From the 1960s through the 1990s, the result
   was slow but steady accretion of power and responsibility. More recently
   political polarization and shifting Supreme Court jurisprudence has led
   to more rapid alteration of agency policy and enforcement practices.},

Title = {Job insecurity and vote for radical parties: A four-country study},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {90},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Job insecurity is a pervasive phenomenon whose effects on support for
   different parties have attracted increasing attention in the literature.
   A growing body of research has assessed the relationship between job
   insecurity and the success of radical parties in Western democracies,
   but results are still inconclusive due to the complex nature of this
   independent variable. This article contributes new evidence to the
   current debates on this topic by analyzing how both objective labour
   market status and perceived job insecurity are associated with the vote
   for radical right and radical left parties. Our findings, based on four
   original surveys conducted in France, Germany, Greece and Spain, suggest
   that perceived job insecurity is generally associated with greater
   support for the radical left, but not for the radical right. In
   contrast, we find the relationship between objective labour market
   status and support for radical parties to be more ambiguous (and, in
   most cases, statistically non-significant).},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Increasingly, corporations expand through the creation or acquisition of
   new subsidiary companies. Despite the commonality of the practice,
   little is known regarding how it influences corporations' political
   behavior. This research note analyzes how subsidiaries shape
   corporations' political interests and collaborations as they seek to
   influence the Supreme Court. To accomplish this, we construct a
   historical dataset of the acquisitions and mergers of a politically
   active sample of Fortune 500 corporations (spanning various industries
   and sizes) that we combine with their history of filing amicus curiae
   briefs to the Court. Through social network and longitudinal analyses,
   we analyze whether and how corporations change their targeted issue
   areas, collaborations, and political success following consolidation.
   While mergers and acquisitions have little effect on the quantity of
   actions or success before the Court, they expand the issues of political
   interest for corporations, and increase both their popularity and
   ability to broker information in their political network.},

Title = {Ecologies for Peacebuilding in Ciudad Bolivar's Community Processes},
Journal = {CIUDAD PAZ-ANDO},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {This study explores the perceptions and initiatives of ten community-led
   processes in Ciudad Bolivar, Bogot \& aacute;. Using a qualitative
   approach grounded in socio-hermeneutics, it employs the generative model
   as a strategy to reveal the innovations developed by social actors in
   the territory when addressing conflicts. Dialogues conducted through
   focus groups highlight the resources, values, and skills these actors
   use to navigate adversity. They frame the body within a relational and
   processual perspective, viewing it as the first territory for producing
   meanings that contribute to strengthening a culture of peace. The study
   concludes that these initiatives are shaped by positive social emotions
   and rely on environmentally oriented cultural artifacts, with
   implications for the establishment of new social ecologies.},

Volume = {86},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1083-1086},

Abstract = {Quantitative historical analysis must be nested in a qualitative
   understanding of the empirical context if it is to be credible. Bruce
   Bueno de Mesquita and Ethan Bueno de Mesquita's analysis of the
   consequences of the Investiture Controversy (1075-1122) for the
   development of lay political authority and economic development
   illustrates this. They portray the Investiture Controversy and the
   concordats it produced as strengthening lay rulers' power over bishop
   appointment, but the dominant view among historians is that it did the
   opposite. They also operationalize bishop alignment in a problematic
   way, which makes it very difficult to draw firm conclusions from their
   quantitative analysis. Finally, they project a modern image of
   international agreements and state power onto a medieval period that
   looked very different, and their supporting qualitative evidence suffers
   from selection bias. The example shows how political scientists must do
   solid historical spadework before they model and interpret their data.},

Abstract = {Less than 1 year after President Biden announced a sweeping plan to
   reduce - and in many cases eliminate - the student loan burden for the
   46 million Americans who hold educational debt, the Supreme Court ruled
   the proposal unconstitutional in Biden v. Nebraska. Media accounts
   immediately speculated about whether the Court's actions would spell
   trouble for the President's reelection efforts, presuming that voters
   would punish Biden for a perceived policy failure. Despite, or perhaps
   because of, these concerns, the administration has continued to pursue
   student debt forgiveness through other means, and highlighting these
   efforts has been a key component of the president's re-election
   strategy. Prior research suggests that Democrats, and the president in
   particular, stand to benefit electorally from pursuing student debt
   relief. But did the Supreme Court's decision to block the president's
   plan change who voters hold accountable for the problem of student loan
   debt? And to what extent is the issue motivating voters from different
   constituencies in 2024? This study leverages insights from an original
   survey experiment fielded in August 2023 to explore the dynamics of
   blame attribution for federal student debt cancellation efforts. We find
   that, contrary to media speculation, voters place much greater blame on
   the Supreme Court and congressional Republicans for the problem of
   student debt, while President Biden receives relatively little blame. We
   consider the implications of these findings for the short-term electoral
   politics of student debt relief policy as well as the increasingly
   salient politics of debt relief more broadly.},

   channels},

Volume = {47},

Pages = {624-643},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Cities have little formalized access to the European Union (EU) system,
   yet research indicates that cities are forming more direct relations
   with actors outside national borders, including EU institutions. Based
   on 23 interviews on the EU activities of Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm,
   this article investigates whether the Scandinavian capital cities engage
   in lobbying towards the EU, their choice of lobby channel and the
   justification for this choice. The article finds that lobbying the EU is
   important for all three cities, but that they value different channels.
   The article has three contributions: First, to contribute to the latest
   broadening of the application of the multilevel governance perspective
   by studying the role of cities in EU lobbying; second, to add to the
   literature on EU lobbying by studying the role of networks and
   associations for cities lobbying the EU; and third, the article argues
   that extra-state channels are especially important for cities in non-EU
   countries, the so-called, ``third country actors.{''}},

Abstract = {How do dominant-group natives react to immigrants' political
   integration? We argue that ethnic minority immigrants winning political
   office makes natives feel threatened, triggering animosity. We test this
   dynamic across the 2010-2019 UK general elections, using hate crime
   police records, public opinion data, and text data from over 500,000
   regional and local newspaper articles. While past work has not
   established a causal relationship between minorities' political power
   gains and dominant-group animosity, we identify natives' hostile
   reactions with a regression discontinuity design that leverages close
   election results between immigrant-origin ethnic minority and
   dominant-group candidates. We find that minority victories increase hate
   crimes by 67\%, exclusionary attitudes by 66\%, and negative media
   coverage of immigrant groups by 110\%. Consistent with power threat and
   social identity theories, these findings demonstrate a strong and
   widespread negative reaction-encompassing a violence-prone fringe and
   the mass public-against ethnic minority immigrants' integration into
   majority settings.},

Abstract = {Russia's war on Ukraine has generated a new chain of insecurities in
   Europe: energy and food crises, new migration flows from Ukraine,
   Belarus and Russia, military threats sharpened by Russia's invasion are
   triggering a spatial and territorial reshuffling of Europe's Eastern
   flank. In this context, regional dynamics within and across the Eastern
   frontiers of Europe have undergone a succession of path-breaking
   transformations ranging from overt support to the Ukrainian war effort
   to decoupling from the Russian economy and an unprecedented boost to
   expanding the European Union's security architecture. However, one of
   the most important effects of the war is the growing gap between two
   regional models which might be dubbed normative (Europeanization within
   the EU- and NATO-led European normative space) and post-colonial
   (exemplified by different Russia-centric projects within the post-Soviet
   space). The original contribution of this special issue is to address
   the conceptual connections between security, borders and national
   identity to discuss the evolving European landscape. While we do not
   explore the military side of the war, we focus on the nexus of
   (in)security and bordering practices to capture how a combination of
   geopolitical changes, economic dynamics and human dimensions of war has
   created new borders and reshaped existing ones.},

Abstract = {This article discusses post-Brexit asylum policy in the UK. On the
   surface, Brexit had little impact on asylum, but Brexit, combined with
   the new phenomenon of small boat Channel crossings, created the
   conditions for a new and extreme UK policy agenda. It explains how
   politicians have sought to deliver border sovereignty performatively
   after Brexit by introducing extreme measures, ostensibly-though not
   practically-to stop small boat Channel crossings, and how private actors
   have sought to profit from people seeking asylum within this policy
   regime. These interrelated political and financial interests are pursued
   irrespective of the fact that none of the policies being advanced will
   `stop the boats'.},

Abstract = {Beginning explorations of civil society organisations (CSOs) from a
   democratic, political, or regulatory perspective potentially overlooks
   important aspects of CSO activity. Instead, this paper takes CSOs in
   action as its starting point - specifically, Australian CSOs responding
   to the needs of people and communities during the crisis of the COVID-19
   coronavirus pandemic. Working between reflections by Australian CSO
   leaders during the pandemic and selected literature, a multi-grounded
   theory approach is used to produce a novel theoretical contribution - a
   typology of 10 distinct CSO activities. These 10 activities are divided
   into three categories: (1) The `Big Three' activities - advocate
   systemically, deliver service and build capacity; (2) `Business As
   Usual' activities - engage community, manage organisation and work
   collaboratively; and (3) `Enabling' activities - conduct research,
   coordinate network, hold space and provide funding. The final three
   activities are revealed as being less integrated into the broader CSO
   literature than their more commonly explored counterparts.},

Abstract = {Government contracts are a huge business and, in many countries, are
   associated with considerable corruption. Much research emphasizes
   bureaucratic improvements as a means to reduce corruption. This paper
   draws a sharp distinction between the extent to which a bureaucracy is
   politically controlled and its technical capacity. In it, I argue that
   in politically controlled bureaucracies, stronger technical capacity
   facilitates corruption. In such contexts, more capable bureaucrats
   utilize their skills to shield favored firms from competition using
   complex strategies that minimize the risk of detection. I test the
   argument on a novel dataset of 54,623 municipal contracts in Guatemala
   awarded between 2013 and 2019 and 21,631 firm-politician ties. I find
   that more capable bureaucracies increase the likelihood of
   well-connected firms winning contracts through less competitive
   processes. This paper delivers important policy lessons, an original,
   widely applicable, measure of political networks and new insights into
   the sources of corruption.},

   Conflicts such as the war in Ukraine have exposed vulnerabilities in
   fossil fuel dependence and strained regional energy security. By
   focusing on the strategic role T \& uuml;rkiye plays and how both
   regions are navigating the energy transition, this paper evaluates their
   policies, collaborations, and efforts to align energy security with the
   green transformation. It also analyzes the new challenges created by

Abstract = {Role theory utilizes sociological and political science tools to study
   parliamentary functioning and parliamentarians' behavior. While scholars
   in the USA (1960-70) and Europe (1990-2010) have extensively applied it,
   this review focuses on its enduring theoretical validity. It introduces
   a role choice typology, categorizing parliamentarians in empirical
   studies. The analysis highlights role theory strengths and weaknesses,
   highlighting that the goal of reelection represents only one potential
   explanation of parliamentarian behavior. The article suggests
   reconsidering the sociological concept of role to derive testable
   hypotheses. In addition, the article extends role theory applications to
   studying legislative careers and less institutionalized legislatures.},

Abstract = {To what extent are local races across the country being increasingly
   driven by politics at the national level? In this article, we examine
   the nationalization of elections for state executive branches' primary
   front line legal actors in the criminal courts-local prosecutors. We
   seek to better understand the factors influencing prosecutor election
   outcomes and why these types of elections have become more nationalized
   in recent years. More specifically, we aim to evaluate what effect this
   greater nationalization has had on the electoral fates of incumbent
   prosecutors seeking re-election. To date, there is a paucity of
   scholarship on prosecutor election outcomes within political science
   despite their importance historically and in light of recent events.
   This article seeks to fill an important gap in our understanding of what
   drives prosecutor elections in the United States. More broadly, we
   believe this research helps us better understand how even these local
   elections can be impacted by national events.},

Abstract = {The research presented in this paper aims to find out which business
   associations had the greatest capacity of influencing Spanish public
   issues throughout the first half of 2022 in the autonomous communities
   of Madrid and Catalonia, and the key contributing factors for their
   influence on policymakers. The developed methodology concedes to each
   association a score based on its presence in public committees, number
   of members and employees, seniority, transparency, and contribution to
   the economy. A sample of 186 professional associations was extracted
   from four transparency registers. Transport and digital sectors showed
   greater capacity of influence than many traditional industries, thanks
   to their participation in committees, their membership, and their impact
   on the national economy. Indirect lobbying emerges as a key practice for
   these organizations, which also benefit from internal structures with
   specialized working groups and from hiring a director of Public Affairs.},

Abstract = {Do narratives about the causes of inequality influence support for
   redistribution? Scholarship suggests that information about levels of
   inequality does not easily shift redistributive attitudes. We embed
   information about inequality within a commentary article depicting the
   economy as being rigged to advantage elites, a common populist narrative
   of both the left and right. Drawing on the media effects and political
   economy literature, we expect articles employing narratives that portray
   inequality as the consequence of systemic unfairness to increase demands
   for redistribution. We test this proposition via an online survey
   experiment with 7426 respondents in Australia, France, Germany,
   Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Our narrative
   treatment significantly increases attitudes favoring redistribution in
   five of the countries. In the US the treatment has no effect. We
   consider several reasons for the non-result in the US - highlighting
   beliefs about government inefficiency - and conclude by discussing
   general implications of our findings.},

Abstract = {This article explores the deepening of affective polarization in rural
   Indonesia after the Village Law. The 2014 Village Law was envisioned as
   an essential way for promoting rural decentralization to fostering
   collaborative governance. Nevertheless, this article finds that there
   has been a deepening of polarization in rural communities after Village
   Law. Through an everyday political approach, the study employs
   qualitative research to provide a more tangible picture of the depth of
   polarization. This article examines three ways of affective polarization
   in rural communities: intense political competition, disaggregated
   voting patterns, and selective handing out of government benefits. We
   conclude that the dynamics of the village head election, built on ethnic
   and religious lines, generate an intense political competition and
   segregated voting patterns. Furthermore, affective polarization
   ultimately affects the selective distribution of government benefits.
   This article offers new insights into the aftermath of the Village Law
   dynamics from village head elections to village governance, focusing on
   how polarization in rural Indonesia is deepening.},

Abstract = {A majority of Americans spend a substantial amount of time at work where
   they have little to no say over many issues-a phenomenon that
   philosophers have likened to a ``private government{''} that resembles a
   dictatorship. Is this because Americans are indifferent to or even
   prefer to work for firms that resemble dictatorships? To answer this
   question, we field a conjoint experiment on a nationally-representative
   sample of Americans to isolate public preferences over ``corporate
   regime type.{''} We find that Americans prefer workplace democracy. In a
   second experiment, we find that most Americans support workplace
   democracy even after being exposed to framing emphasizing
   democratization's costs. The results suggest that social scientists must
   look beyond public opinion to understand the lack of workplace democracy
   in the United States. This article forges new ground by applying a
   political science lens to corporate governance-a field ripe with
   politics but bereft of political science.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to show the trend in the use of women in
   the commission of economic crimes, with particular reference to tax
   evasion in Argentina. To this end, methodologically, we resort to the
   doctrine that has analysed the problem, which is still scarce, and
   mainly to the recent jurisprudence of the Courts of that country. In
   fact, in recent years, the courts specialized in tax matters, both tax
   criminal and tax litigation, in judgments that have proposed a vision of
   the facts with a gender perspective, especially highlight one of the
   most pernicious socio -cultural patterns that exists, which is the use
   of women for criminal purposes. Generally, it is carried out with
   vulnerable and low-income women, although it is also observed in women
   without this condition, generally relatives - mothers, wives and
   daughters - of the real perpetrators of the different crimes.By way of
   conclusion, the paper highlights that the phenomenon known as the
   feminization of poverty leads women to be part of criminal maneuvers
   that other actors commit in which they are used as shareholders or as
   presidents of companies created for the sole purpose of committing
   crimes typical of economic crime.},

Title = {Mobilizing middlemen: the Conservative Political Action Conference and
   the creation of party activists},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 26},
Abstract = {How are activists molded into middlemen in a polarized two-party system?
   Using the case of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC),
   this paper examines the process of activist mobilization that occurs at
   political gatherings. Using two rounds of interviews and participant
   observation from CPAC in 2019 and 2020, I argue that contrary to popular
   media portrayals of CPAC as political theater now rooted in the
   spectacle of President Trump, the conference is an important site of
   mobilizing activists into party middlemen. This happens through three
   processes: first conference attendees are taught conservative policy
   stances and presented with a bundle of issue positions; second, they are
   provided with the tools for effective activism formally through provided
   training and informally through socialization; and finally, their
   conservative identity is continually defined and reinforced with
   cultural meaning-making practices throughout the conference.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {454-473},

Abstract = {The development of generative artificial intelligence raises justified
   concerns about the possibility of undermining trust in democratic
   processes, especially elections. Deep fakes are often considered one of
   the particularly dangerous forms of media manipulation. Subsequent
   research confirms that they contribute to strengthening the sense of
   uncertainty among citizens and negatively affect the information
   environment. The aim of this study is to analyse the use of deep fakes
   in 11 countries in 2023, in the context of elections and to indicate
   potential consequences for future electoral processes, in particular
   with regard to the significant number of elections in 2024. We argue
   that a so-called ``information apocalypse{''} emerges mainly from
   exaggeratedly alarmist voices that make it difficult to shape
   responsible narratives and may have the features of a self-fulfilling
   prophecy. Thus, we suggest to use the term ``pollution{''} instead and
   improve scientific and journalistic discourse that might be a
   precondition for reducing threats that touch on social reactions to deep
   fakes and their potential.},

Abstract = {Across much of the South, digital technologies are increasingly central
   to the expansion of state social protection systems. Supported by major
   development agencies, many of these distributive technologies are
   developed and implemented by financial technology companies with the
   specific aim of accelerating financial inclusion. While researchers have
   documented the influence of these financial actors and logics over
   social policy, we know less about how these interventions are
   transforming the experience of receiving social protection. Based on
   qualitative and observational research with social grant recipients in
   South Africa, this research demonstrates how digital and financial
   technologies produce confusion, informational opacities and new forms of
   exclusion among grant recipients. It suggests that the increasingly
   prominent role of financial technologies in the delivery of social
   protection undermines state capacity and further entrenches the
   influence of neoliberal logics over social policy. Finally, the article
   suggests that these technologies may be transforming the nature of
   social citizenship in South Africa, undermining efforts to advance
   universal and redistributive social protection policies.},

Abstract = {Research on policy shifts has found that repositioning can be costly as
   it affects candidates' perceived honesty, reliability, and competence.
   It remains unclear, however, whether a politician's gender affects
   perceptions of repositioning. Research on gender stereotypes has found
   that while male politicians are viewed as more competent, decisive, and
   displaying strong leadership, female politicians are believed to be more
   honest. Applying expectancy-violation theory, I test the hypothesis that
   the reputational cost of repositioning is more pronounced for female
   politicians in a preregistered survey experiment fielded on a large
   convenience sample in Flanders, Belgium (n = 6,957). I find that while
   frequent repositioning is evaluated negatively, the negative effect of
   repositioning is not more pronounced for female candidates than for male
   candidates on most outcome measures.},

Title = {(Small D-democratic) vacation, all I ever wanted? The effect of
   democratic backsliding on leisure travel in the American states},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {As many American states have considered policies consistent with
   democratic backsliding in recent years, political elites and scholars
   have speculated on the consequences of these policies for political
   behavior. We examine the effect of backsliding policies on Americans'
   preferences over leisure travel destinations; because vacationing is
   transitory, this focus allows us to isolate the role of individuals'
   democratic predispositions and values in preference formation from the
   implications of these policies on their self-interest that they would
   experience from living under those policies themselves. Through
   pre-registered conjoint and vignette survey experiments, we find that
   Americans, and especially Democrats, express less interest in
   vacationing in states that recently adopted backsliding policies. Our
   results spotlight an accountability mechanism by which Americans may
   sanction backsliding states, though the modest magnitude of these
   sanctions - less than 1\% of backsliding states' gross domestic products
   - may not deter backsliding behavior on their own.},

Abstract = {Does foreign interference help or harm protest movements? An extensive
   literature has debated this question but focuses on observational data,
   obscuring a crucial mechanism for protest success: its effect on public
   attitudes. We argue that public accusations of foreign meddling damage
   protest groups by reducing public support. In survey experiments
   conducted in the United States and Canada, we find that credible
   accusations of foreign interference erode support by discrediting
   protester groups among sympathizers and inflaming nationalist fears.
   Indeed, such accusations delegitimize protest movements even among those
   sympathetic to the cause. Conditional factors, such as the type of
   foreign assistance or the identity of the meddling state, have no
   impact. These findings reveal how referencing foreign backing is a
   potent discrediting tactic-it influences public opinion, a critical
   determinant for protest outcomes.},

Abstract = {This article examines recent developments in Italy's economic and fiscal
   policymaking. It does so by contextualising the 2023 changes in the
   Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) within three
   broader aspects which have characterised the Italian political economy:
   (1) the country's conservative fiscal trajectory inside the monetary
   union (EMU); (2) the expansionary economic policies pursued in the face
   of both the pandemic and energy crises; (3) the peculiar characteristics
   of Italy's `dual-hybrid economy'. The article posits that, since the
   EMU, Italy has continuously run primary budget surpluses higher than its
   EMU peers. Only since Covid-19, and with the relaxation of EMU
   constraints, has Italy's fiscal stance turned expansionary. This has
   allowed space for various socioeconomic policies to partially shield
   households and firms from the crises' fallout. However, with a return to
   fiscal conservatism, the NRRP now represents the only game in town to
   try and address Italy's dual hybridity characterised by weak state
   capacity and supply-side institutional inconsistencies as well as two
   diametrically opposed regional growth regimes in the North and the
   South.},

Abstract = {Deliberation among the public appears wanting, even in many of the
   world's established democracies. This apparent lack of mutually
   respectful conversation among citizens about politics involving a
   give-and-take of reasons is often ascribed to growing affective
   polarisation. The more the citizens come to think of each other as
   belonging to opposing groups, the less likely it allegedly becomes that
   they will show respect towards each other or exchange arguments while
   talking politics. However, the empirical support for this common
   supposition remains tentative, as prior research suffers from potential
   endogeneity problems and selection bias. To address these limitations,
   we introduce a novel experimental design involving an imagined
   conversation on refugee policy in Poland. Our experimental test shows
   that, on average, participants' inclination to deliberate did not
   significantly differ based on whether they imagined talking to someone
   from an ingroup or to someone from an outgroup instead. Our findings
   thereby suggest that the relationship between group identification and
   public deliberation might not be as straightforward as is often assumed.
   At least in some contexts, a lack of mutual group identification does
   not spell disaster for deliberation.},

Abstract = {Based on interviews with UK civil servants working on counterterrorism,
   this article examines how racialised and gendered organisational norms
   govern the production and circulation of knowledge in government
   departments. It further reflects on their implications for policymakers
   and academics seeking to introduce critical perspectives into
   counterterrorism policymaking. Mobilising Charles W. Mills's concept of
   white ignorance, I explore how routinised practices serve to suppress
   knowledge about the racialised impacts of UK counterterrorism, and
   particularly the Prevent programme, within policymaking spaces. The
   article outlines eight practices that effect the suppression or
   delegitimisation of testimony substantiating critiques of
   counterterrorism policies as racist: framing accusations of racism as
   misunderstandings; focusing on intentions over impacts; self-silencing;
   limiting what counts as evidence; framing critics as
   emotionally-oriented; decisions concerning who participates in these
   policy discussions in the first place; the siloing of discussions about
   racism in dedicated spaces; and efforts to frame analyses of structural
   racism as breaking civil servants' obligation to political neutrality. I
   conclude that, because the persistence of colonial counterterrorism
   practices is, fundamentally, not a problem of knowledge but a problem of
   power, it will not be solved through the kind of policy advocacy
   scholars are encouraged to undertake to demonstrate ``research
   impact{''}.},

   Quebec disengaged citizens?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The literature on populism is vast, with most studies exploring this
   phenomenon in contexts where populist parties play a central role in
   steering populist ideas and mobilizing their supporters. Yet, populist
   ideas can be supported by a widespread share of the population even in
   the absence of populist parties. This study investigates and compares
   how left- and right-wing populists engage with politics when no populist
   party represents their voice in the political system. Relying on a
   survey of 5633 respondents in Quebec (Canada), we examine how support
   for populist ideas relates to different forms of political
   participation. Our findings indicate that left-wing populists are less
   likely to vote than other citizens, specifically at the provincial
   level. This finding, however, does not hold for their right-wing
   counterparts. Moreover, right-wing populists exhibit a greater
   propensity to engage in non- and semi-institutional forms of action that
   enable them to express their grievances directly to elected officials.
   With these forms of action not observed among left-wing populists, our
   study points to fundamental differences in the expression of left- and
   right-wing populisms. Despite these differences, our study indicates
   that all populists perceive more than other citizens that violence can
   be a legitimate mean of action.},

Title = {On the transformation of values into prices of production apropos of
   Moseley's Money and Totality},
Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2025},

Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Mosely's book provides a vantage point for a critical analysis of the
   `transformation problem', as it questions the dominant conceptions that
   reduce the methodological debate to a matter of constructing systems of
   equations; at the same time, it shares with them the reduction of the
   methodological question to a matter of interpreting Marx's texts.
   Moseley interprets `Capital' as a logical representation composed of a
   macro theory and a micro theory. The article starts by showing how this
   approach mutilates the organic unity between social capital and
   individual capitals. Consequently, focus is placed on Moseley's
   presupposition of values as if they were given in prices of production
   to explain the determination of these same prices, as well as on his
   exclusion of gold's exchangeability as a product of capital from the
   transformation process. The article extends the methodological analysis
   to the above-mentioned prevailing conceptions and their ideological
   basis. Next, it shows how they coincide with Moseley's in the logical
   inconsistency of assuming that the value of total variable capital and
   total surplus value appear unchanged in prices of production, although
   the organic compositions of the spheres that produce their material
   content differ from the social average. At this point, the real issue is
   brought forward: it is not about interpreting Marx's texts in search of
   a `given' or an `invariance postulate' to construct a model that
   satisfies them; the point is to follow Marx's methodological proposal to
   reproduce by way of thought the concrete determinations that make values
   take the complete form of prices of production of a certain magnitude.
   Finally, the article follows this path to demonstrate how, even if the
   value contents of total variable capital and total surplus value remain
   quantitatively unchanged, the prices of production in which they
   necessarily take form will quantitatively differ from those value
   contents.},

Abstract = {Drawing upon empirical research conducted in Patras in 2015, this paper
   investigates the multiplicity of visible and invisible practices
   migrants have employed to challenge, negotiate, or evade the pervasive
   border regime and (attempt to) claim their freedom of settlement and
   movement. The paper will make two interrelated contributions.
   Theoretically, it will critically explore the concepts of `acts of
   citizenship' and `imperceptible politics' through the lens of visibility
   to analyse the nuances and differences between them and reinstate their
   importance in capturing the vitality of migrants' agency. Empirically,
   the paper will investigate the interplay of visibility and invisibility
   both in the development of the European and national border regimes and
   in the fragmented formation process of a migrant political subjectivity.
   In capturing and analysing the ever-changing development of migrants'
   movements and struggles, as well as their multiple ways of being
   political through visibility and invisibility within, beyond, and after
   citizenship, the paper contributes to the ongoing dialogue between two
   broader bodies of work: Critical Citizenship Studies and Autonomy of
   Migration.},

Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Number = {47},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Colombia's internal armed conflict, dating back to the 1960s, has
   garnered international attention and become a priority for many donor
   countries. The resurgence of violence in the 1990s, combined with the
   influx of drug trafficking funds and the emergence of new illegal
   actors, resulted in fresh humanitarian crises and human rights
   violations. Concurrently, the internationalization of the armed
   conflict, spearheaded by the government of Andres Pastrana (1998-2002)
   through the policy of diplomacy for peace, brought the shared
   responsibility approach to drug control onto the global stage. The
   European Union has played a significant role in Colombia, particularly
   in conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and supporting the country's
   development process. In contrast to US cooperation, European engagement
   has been characterized by a less militaristic approach to addressing the
   ongoing armed conflict in Colombia. This approach is evident in
   intervention strategies more directly linked to civil society. These
   strategies encompass cooperation in peacebuilding and the promotion of
   human rights. This research aims to elucidate and analyze the strategies
   employed by the European Union in resolving the conflict and fostering
   peace in Colombia, while also assessing their effectiveness.},

Number = {204},
Pages = {21-59},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Domination has been a subject of extensive attention in political
   thought and social critique. However, the ecological emergency demands
   that we move beyond traditional conceptions that focus solely on human
   harm and oppressions. Instead, we need to construct a holistic approach
   that captures the complex, multidimensional, and multifaceted dynamics
   unfolding when addressing environmental issues. This extends not only to
   human relationships but also to interactions with non-human entities and
   components of nature. This work aims to contribute to the systemic
   construction of green domination. To achieve this, it explores the
   perspectives of critical theory, republicanism, environmental justice,
   and ecofeminism. In alignment with the goal of encompassing the broadest
   possible dimensions, the scope is expanded to move beyond blind readings
   of other knowledge productions. Non-hegemonic republicanism, peripheral
   critical thinking, ontological turn, and eco-territorial feminisms from
   the Global South are incorporated. This contribution aids in crafting a
   map of domination that now takes on a green hue, undoubtedly
   facilitating the contemplation of new paradigms and the development of
   creative strategies for emancipation.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the Italian parliamentary debate on the Same-sex
   Civil Partnerships (SSP) bill, highlighting a `traditionalist' pattern
   in Italy's morality politics. It investigates the multifaceted arguments
   brought to the debate, revealing a range of stances within and across
   parties. The study emphasizes a shift from religious justifications to
   post-materialist argumentative frames deployed by MPs to influence the
   highly conflictual negotiation process in a context of external and
   internal pressures. It posits that the traditionalist model in Italian
   morality politics is defined by a complex array of argumentative framing
   strategies that transcend party lines. This approach is pivotal in
   understanding the nuanced legislative outcome of the SSP bill - falling,
   strictly speaking, neither into the category of success nor into the
   category of failure - which recognized same-sex partnerships but fell
   short of equating them with marriage (notably excluding same-sex
   parenting and filiation rights) and preventing them from being
   recognized as families.},

Abstract = {Several studies have underscored the recent emergence of
   `Russia-sympathizing' parties, particularly within the European far left
   and far right party families. This study aims to shed further light on
   the conceptions of Russia within these families by examining party
   positions regarding Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Utilising content
   analysis of party standpoints, and employing both cross-sectional
   quantitative and case-based qualitative analytical techniques, the
   research underscores the importance of ideology in shaping extreme and
   radical parties' attitudes towards Russia. Specifically, the findings
   suggest a connection between populism and Russia sympathy, with far left
   and far right parties more inclined to express sympathy with Russia also
   exhibiting higher levels of populism. Euroscepticism emerges as another
   factor influencing Russia sympathy, however only among far right
   parties. Taken together, the study offers valuable insights into the
   complex landscape of party politics, foreign policy and contemporary
   Russia.},

Abstract = {Donating to a campaign is inherently costly, and as a result the
   composition of campaign donors differs from the composition of the
   electorate. What happens when the financial barriers to campaign finance
   participation are removed? This paper analyzes Seattle's recent campaign
   finance reform, where all registered voters receive four \$25 vouchers
   to donate to candidates abiding by stricter campaign finance
   restrictions. Utilizing individual- and census block group-level data
   combined with administrative donation records, I find that those most
   mobilized by the availability of vouchers belong to groups already
   overrepresented within the donor pool. This finding is significant
   across race, income, past political participation, age, and
   partisanship. In some cases, the availability of vouchers appears to
   pull the donor pool further from parity with the larger electorate.},

Abstract = {The Russo-Ukrainian War has produced a myriad of necropolitical
   discourses regarding the justification of death and the subjugation of
   lives to potential death. Contemporary necropolitical scholarship has
   primarily focused on the civilian, subaltern dimension of this paradigm
   in a wider context, yet in this war, combatants from the opposing armed
   forces are the individuals most consistently embedded in these
   conditions of potential death. How, then, is the potential death of the
   combatant justified and legitimized? Through a critical engagement with
   the concept of the border as the front, this article will explore how
   the subjugation of Ukrainian and Russian combatants to the conditions of
   potential death is discursively justified through a framework of the
   necropolitical logics of survival and martyrdom. Through these logics,
   two competing necropolitical regimes of truth have arisen, nevertheless
   leading to the same conclusion - the mobilized bodies of the combatants
   at the front - yet promising different versions of a life beyond death
   itself.},

Abstract = {This study examines how the Federal National Council (FNC), the
   parliament of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), transformed from a
   consultative body to a legislative institution through gradual and
   incremental changes. It argues that the increasing number of
   parliamentary questions led to legal, procedural, and behavioral changes
   in the FNC, influenced by external (government support and public
   pressure) and internal (rationality, competence, incrementalism, and
   system development) factors. The success of this transformation is
   attributed to its gradual nature. Anticipating continued momentum, the
   study outlines future prospects shaped by the UAE government's
   commitment to FNC empowerment, heightened public expectations, and the
   influx of educated and experienced individuals into parliamentary roles.
   This ongoing institutional change reflects a responsive adaptation to
   evolving governance demands in the UAE. The study contributes to the
   theory of institutions and the understanding of legislative oversight in
   newly liberalized political systems.},

Abstract = {Why do some AQ and IS affiliates fight one another while others avoid
   tension or even coordinate? While the extant theories of environment and
   power balancing provide inroads into such a puzzle, they overlook key
   relational factors shaping jihadist affiliate behaviour. In this
   article, I develop a relational theory of AQ-IS interactions, mapping
   out three avenues of pre-existing social networks: affiliate-civilian,
   AQ-IS affiliate and affiliate-unaffiliated rebels. Using several
   datasets, I examine AQ-IS relations in six regions from 2014 to 2018
   with a crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis. Rival affiliates
   conflict less while relying on civilian support and cooperate more as
   off-shoots.},

Journal = {INSIGHT TURKEY},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {This research shows that the U.S. recognition of Israel's sovereignty
   over the Golan Heights is a radical shift in U.S. policy regarding the
   ownership of lands seized by military force since the Second World War.
   It is also considered a new and implicit abandonment by Washington of
   its commitment as a guarantor of the post-war international order.
   Moreover, this recognition will set a precedent for other countries to
   militarily seize any lands they claim are vital to their strategic
   security. Crucially, this recognition does not have any legal effect. It
   is null and void, with no international value or legitimacy, and is a
   clear violation of the provisions of international law and international
   treaties, agreements, covenants, and norms. It also threatens
   international peace and security and incites other countries to seize
   illegally the lands of their neighbors. Furthermore, it is contrary to
   all resolutions that have been issued in a legitimate manner, including
   those issued by the United Nations obligating Israel to return these
   lands. The Golan is legally recognized internationally as occupied
   Syrian territory before and after this recognition. Since the right to
   self-determination is linked to peoples and not to states, Israel cannot
   confiscate this right under the pretext that ``the Syrian state has
   engaged in an aggressive war against its people.{''}},

Abstract = {Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham has been one of the main beneficiaries of the
   fragmentation of state power in Syria, developing from a transnational
   jihadist group affiliated to al-QaMODIFIER LETTER LEFT HALF RINGida to a
   locally rooted actor and de facto state power. This paper considers how
   the group has enacted a performance of sovereignty and statehood that
   has developed over time, and how central legal identity has been to
   these efforts. It examines how Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham has attempted to
   perform as the legitimate governing actor using control over identity
   documentation and also how this performance engenders a relationship
   between ruler and ruled in Idlib. Each act as an authority reproduces
   the group as the state power. But in few other areas of governance is
   the act so explicit, the performance so overt, as in the use of legal
   identity.},

Abstract = {The article analyses politicians' attitudes towards men's participation
   in the representation of gender equality interests. Recent studies
   emphasise the participation of men politicians, since gender equality
   should be understood as a concern for both women and men in society.
   Conversely, it is argued that women politicians, who share
   gender-specific experiences of discrimination with other women, are the
   primary actors in gender equality representation. This article explores
   to what extent these viewpoints are shared among politicians in Canada,
   Portugal, Romania and Switzerland, and analyses the socio-demographic
   and ideological determinants influencing politicians' support for an
   active role of men representatives. Data from the Comparative Candidate
   Study (2019-2024) show that almost half of the candidates consider
   gender equality as a field primarily suited to women representatives.
   Older candidates, as well as those with conservative ideological
   positions, are more inclined to view women as the primary actors in
   gender equality representation.},

Abstract = {This introduction to the special issue recalls the alarm raised in EU
   capitals and Brussels after the UK's in-out referendum delivered a Leave
   vote in June 2016. The fear was of a domino effect and the further
   fragmentation of an already divided EU. Seven years later, it is clear
   that there was rapid attrition of Eurosceptic triumphalism, and the
   EU-27 showed remarkable unity. This required a sustained collective
   effort to contain a membership crisis and maintain the EU polity. Yet,
   the issue contributors challenge the notion that the alarm was unfounded
   and explain why this counter-factual did not materialise, even though
   potential for future membership crises of different sorts was revealed.
   Theoretically, this supports an understanding of the EU as a polity that
   is fragile, yet able to assert porous borders, exercise authority over a
   diverse membership, and mobilise a modicum of loyalty when the entire
   integration regime is under threat.},

Abstract = {Political party think tanks (PPTTs) are important to the performance of
   parties' core functions. Despite their importance, they have largely
   escaped academic attention. To understand the role of PPTTs in
   contemporary politics, we develop a typology of their key functions
   (distinguishing between political party and think tank functions), and
   target audiences (distinguishing between internal and external target
   groups). Based on a comprehensive literature review and 22 in-depth
   interviews with leading representatives of PPTTs in the Netherlands and
   Flanders, we identify four types of PPTTs: Party Assistants, Party
   Supporters, Party Promoters and Party Intellectuals. The characteristics
   of the four types of PPTTs are illustrated through the analysis of four
   paradigmatic cases: the Study Centre Open Vld as an example of a Party
   Assistant, the Scientific Bureau GroenLinks as an example of a Party
   Supporter, the Renaissance Institute as an example of a Party Promoter,
   and the TeldersFoundation as an example of a Party Intellectual.},

Abstract = {Colonialism emerged as a tumultuous collision between Western and
   precolonial power structures, resulting in an unexpected convergence of
   colonial and indigenous patriarchal ideologies. This had paradoxical
   consequences, such as the mutual reinforcement of these ideologies. In
   colonized societies, gender, sexuality, race, class, and religious
   distinctions became intricately intertwined, giving rise to complex
   systems of domination. As a result, postcolonial feminists caution
   against overly simplistic analyses that solely concentrate on single
   dimensions like race or class, or gender in isolation, without
   recognizing their interconnected and mutually co-constituting nature.
   Postcolonial feminism emphasizes the need to avoid universalizing
   tendencies that overlook the unique particulars of different contexts.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {425-444},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Efforts to identify oneself as an ``outsider{''} are an increasingly
   visible feature of the democratic political environment, and perhaps no
   political thinker has utilized outsider rhetoric to greater effect than
   Jean-Jacques Rousseau. That said, virtually no attention has been paid
   to the important role that such rhetoric plays in a work that Rousseau
   believed to be the ``best and most useful{''} of the Eighteenth
   Century-The Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar. In this article I
   attend to the vicar's use of outsider tropes, focusing in particular on
   how they serve to legitimate an account of truth-seeking which would
   otherwise be rejected by the vicar's skeptical audience. I also show how
   the vicar's understanding of the conditions necessary to proper
   truth-seeking are different from Rousseau's own. This argument, if
   successful, illustrates the intrinsically rhetorical character of The
   Profession as well as calling attention to the presence of an important
   though neglected rhetorical strategy. In achieving these dual aims, this
   essay contributes both to the growing literature on The Profession and
   highlights neglected aspects of Rousseau's own rhetorical strategies.},

Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {95},
Number = {2},
Pages = {289-297},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Sinoscepticism is on the rise in British politics. Why is this? And what
   are the implications? This article shows that Sinoscepticism is not
   solely a result of the whims of MPs, but also stems from deep-rooted
   tensions surrounding Britain's position in global order. Specifically,
   the British state finds itself on the horns of a dilemma: accept the
   status quo of staying economically open to China, but face staunch
   criticism and reprisals both internationally and domestically; or become
   more hawkish in relations, but risk worsening Britain's imbalanced and
   underperforming economy. Considering the Conservative Party's
   longstanding commitment to both the `special relationship' with the US
   and to business and finance, this predicament is likely to provoke the
   party. The dilemma is seemingly about relations with one country, but,
   like Euroscepticism, it has the potential to become a stand-in for
   debates over what sort of country the UK should be.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Volume = {46},
Number = {4},
Pages = {2241-2262},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Political trust has long been seen as fundamental for societal
   cooperation and democratic legitimacy. However, evidence about its
   consequences are partial and fragmented, and we do not currently have a
   systematic understanding of whether political trust warrants such vast
   attention. This paper conducts a systematic review and meta-analysis of
   61 studies reporting 329 coefficients derived from over three and a half
   million observations globally. After synthesising the conceptual and
   theoretical frameworks in the extant literature, the meta-analysis
   results show that trust is weakly to moderately related to outcomes as
   diverse as voter turnout, vote choice, policy preferences and
   compliance, but is unrelated to informal participation. These results
   are robust to a range of considerations such as the measurement of
   trust, modelling strategy, region of study, publication bias, and design
   of the study. The review also highlights substantial geographical and
   methodological gaps, particularly the reliance on cross-sectional
   designs. Substantively, the results show that trust is importantly and
   robustly related to what people want from their political systems and
   how they interact with it. By systematically analysing the extant
   research, the paper provides a robust, systematic, and empirical
   foundation to advance research on political trust.},

Abstract = {Using novel survey data collected from the states of Kaduna and Edo in
   Nigeria's Northern and Southern Regions respectively, this study
   examined the correlates of gender egalitarian attitudes with a
   particular focus on gender, educational attainment, religious
   affiliation, and the region where the respondents resided. The
   regression results showed that educational attainment and being female
   positively correlated with support for gender equality in the two
   states. Muslim affiliation negatively correlated with support for gender
   equality in Kaduna; however, in the case of Edo, it was statistically
   insignificant. Moreover, residing in Northern Nigeria negatively
   correlated with support for gender equality. When I broke down the data
   based on gender (males and females) and religious affiliation (Muslims
   and Christians) and compared the subgroups across the two states, the
   descriptive results showed that Muslims in Edo were more supportive of
   gender equality than both Christians and Muslims in Kaduna. Males in Edo
   were also more supportive of gender equality than both females and males
   in Kaduna. This suggests that it would be misleading to lump respondents
   from both states into the same category based on gender or religious
   affiliation because they differ considerably.},

Abstract = {Technological change has dramatically reshaped labor markets, but
   technology's distributional implications have been less politicized than
   those of other economic shocks. As innovation in automation and
   artificial intelligence accelerates, however, political parties face
   growing incentives to ``claim{''} the issue. Candidates proposing to
   protect workers against technological change may appeal directly to
   workers' economic concerns, but if technology is perceived similarly to
   other economic shocks, workers may also be mobilized through populist
   and ethno-nationalist appeals. This paper asks: relative to other
   shocks, what kind of messaging around workplace technological change
   resonates most with workers? We examine this question using a
   ten-country 3 x\textbackslash{}documentclass{[}12pt]\{minimal\}
   \textbackslash{}usepackage\{amsmath\}
   \textbackslash{}usepackage\{wasysym\}
   \textbackslash{}usepackage\{amsfonts\}

   \textbackslash{}usepackage\{upgreek\}
   \textbackslash{}setlength\{\textbackslash{}oddsidemargin\}\{-69pt\}
   \textbackslash{}begin\{document\}\$\$\textbackslash{}times\$\$\textbacks
   lash{}end\{document\} 3 survey experiment that randomly exposes each
   respondent to one of three vignettes featuring excerpts from political
   candidates' speeches: the passages promise to protect workers against
   offshoring, automation and AI, or changing consumer demand and do so
   using populist rhetoric, populist and ethno-nationalist rhetoric, or no
   additional messaging. We find that overall support for protecting
   workers against technology is lower than for other shocks, but that all
   types of candidate messaging appeal to workers who feel vulnerable to
   technology.},

Abstract = {Most research on biased public sector hiring highlights local
   politicians' incentives to distribute government positions to partisan
   supporters. Other studies instead point to the role of bureaucratic
   managers in allocating government jobs to close contacts. We jointly
   consider the relative importance of each source of biased hiring as an
   allocation problem between managers and politicians who have different
   preferences regarding public sector hiring and different abilities to
   realize those preferences. We develop a theoretical model of each
   actor's relative leverage and relative preferences for different types
   of public sector positions. We empirically examine our theory using the
   universe of payroll data in Kenyan local governments from 2004 to 2013.
   We find evidence of both patronage and bureaucratic favoritism, but with
   different types of bias concentrated in different types of government
   jobs, as our theory predicts. Our results highlight the inadequacy of
   examining political patronage alone without incorporating the
   preferences and leverage of the bureaucratic managers who are
   intricately involved in hiring processes.},

   Evidence From East Asian Countries},

Abstract = {Religion is considered to have different aspects of influences on
   political protest, and some have argued that religious participation
   often mobilizes collective political actions by enhancing individuals'
   civic skills and political efficacy. By contrast, religious values and
   beliefs that emphasize the importance of traditional norms and
   conformity tend to reduce individuals' propensities to participate in
   political protest. The influences of religion on individuals' attitudes
   toward coping with injustice and unfairness can be critical for
   explaining their propensities to participate in political protest. Using
   data from the fourth wave of the Asian Barometer Survey, this study
   investigates the role of perceived unfairness in shaping the link
   between religion and political protest in 13 East Asian countries. In
   accordance with the arguments of mobilizing and conforming effects, we
   find that religious attendance increases individuals' propensities to
   engage in political protest, while religiosity has a negative effect on
   political protest. In particular, the results show that the perceived
   unfairness of income distribution mediates the indirect effects of
   religion on political protest. They also present that religious
   affiliations mitigate perceived unfairness and indirectly reduce
   individuals' propensities to participate in political protest.
   Nevertheless, the direct effects of religious attendance on mobilizing
   political protest are stronger.},

Abstract = {Political scientists have long debated whether citizens meet the
   expectations of a `folk theory' of democratic representation, in which
   voters correctly reward and punish politicians for their actions, make
   choices primarily on the basis of policy preferences and orient their
   decisions to the future rather than the past. But how do elected
   politicians themselves theorize voting behaviour? In this paper, we
   report results from an original survey of more than 2000 elected local
   politicians in Canada and the United States which allows us to
   characterize politicians' own democratic theories. We uncover
   substantial variation in politicians' theories of democracy, and we find
   examples of a number of well-known theoretical traditions (democratic
   realism, partisan retrospection, folk theory) among politicians
   themselves. We also show that politicians' theoretical perspectives are
   related to how they undertake representation when in office. We conclude
   with an outline of a comparative research agenda on the causes and
   consequences of politicians' democratic theories.},

Abstract = {This essay analyzes the theme of domestic anxiety of the Indian middle
   class in the 1980s through two specific genres of the contemporary
   popular Hindi films - the family drama and the action adventure. Poised
   right before the 1990s neoliberal drive in the Indian economy, the 80s
   middle class - hitherto staid and hermetic - was rattled by an
   `invasive' global culture, permissiveness, politics of representation,
   rights and reform. This paper shows that the cinematic resolution of
   this crisis is a grudgingly lenient orthodoxy negotiating with the
   limits of cultural inclusion, represented through the questions of
   agency, gender, class, caste and ethnicity abounding in the middle class
   domestic sphere. The essay analyzes the middle class problematization of
   the familial as well as the national in films like Arth (Bhatt, 1982),
   Agar Tum Na Hote (Tandon, 1983), Souten (Tak, 1983), Shaan (Sippy, 1980)
   and Mr. India (Kapur, 1987).},

Title = {Jesus was a Refugee: Religious Values Framing can Increase Support for
   Refugees Among White Evangelical Republicans},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {46},
Number = {4},
Pages = {2145-2168},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We consider how frames highlighting religious values shape opinion among
   individuals who may experience social identity conflict. White
   evangelical Republicans have ardently supported Donald Trump's
   restrictionist stances towards refugees, yet those partisan policy
   stances exist in tension with evangelical Christian values emphasizing
   care for vulnerable strangers. Our pre-registered national experiment
   tests whether a religious message can move white self-identified
   evangelical Republicans' opinions relating to refugees. The pro-refugee
   Christian values message increases favorable attitudes on some, but not
   all, measures. The effect is comparatively stronger among those who are
   more committed to their evangelical identity; unexpectedly, those who
   identify as strong Republicans are not more resistant to the message.
   These results demonstrate that moral reframing, which is known to shape
   attitudes in other domains, can affect self-identified evangelical
   Republicans' attitudes on refugees, potentially shifting the national
   discussion of refugees in the U.S. The finding is all the more
   significant given highly partisan debates over refugees during the Trump
   presidency, which may have made partisans' opinions especially rigid at
   the time of our experiment. Our results also speak to the relevance of
   identity strength in conditioning the impact of religious values frames.},

Abstract = {This paper defends strong emissions sufficientarianism as an approach to
   assigning moral rights to generate greenhouse gas emissions. Strong
   emissions sufficientarianism holds that only subsistence emitting is
   morally permissible. This paper argues that, since it is uncertain how
   many subsistence emissions there will be, the present generation owes it
   to future generations to refrain from generating non-subsistence
   emissions, not to risk imposing on them a tragic choice between
   sacrificing themselves and contributing to very dangerous climate
   change. The paper also addresses the charge that emissions
   sufficientarianism, in general, is too permissive since it entails a
   right to contribute to very dangerous climate change. The overall
   message is that, given the moral urgency posed by climate change, there
   is little room for distributive principles besides emissions
   sufficientarianism. This casts doubt on the appropriateness of relying
   on carbon budgets in assigning rights to emit.},

Abstract = {This introduction to the special issue highlights the key findings and
   implications of democratic backsliding in Southeast Asia. It begins with
   an overview of the region's democratic landscape using the Varieties of
   Democracy (V-Dem) dataset and compares the patterns and modes of
   backsliding in six selected cases. Collectively, the articles suggest
   the importance of unpacking regime components and the growing
   attitudinal elite-mass gap in analyzing the quality of democracy. The
   liberalization effects of social media were found to be mixed. The
   theoretical and empirical findings offer a fertile ground for future
   comparative work beyond the region.},

Abstract = {Expressions of social discontent that trigger deep political reform
   appear to be a sign of the times. Emerging political actors challenge
   delegitimized political elites with promises of a closer relationship
   with electorates, new rules to fight corruption, and more open access to
   the benefits of economic growth. Often, however, reforms in recent
   decades have weakened instead of strengthened democracy, leaving
   political systems less fair and more exclusive than before. The Chilean
   constitution-making process of 2021-2022 reasonably raised hopes for a
   different outcome.},

Title = {Party-System Polarization and Individual Perceptions of Party
   Differences: Two Divergent Effects on Turnout},
Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 10},
Abstract = {In this article, we argue that party-system polarization and subjective
   perceptions of ideological party differences are conceptually and
   empirically distinct phenomena that affect electoral participation
   differently. Looking at 84 elections worldwide, we show that
   party-system polarization, and the sharp conflicts associated with it,
   depresses turnout because many citizens are put off by extreme party
   positions and unrewarding polemics. By contrast, the individual
   perception of differences between parties increases turnout because more
   citizens can find a party that is close to their own position and
   identify others as being further away. These opposite effects are
   possible because party-system polarization leads only some individuals
   to perceive differences between parties but leads others to avoid the
   emotionalized political arena. Moreover, individuals' ability to
   recognize differences between parties is not necessarily a consequence
   of party-system polarization. The contradictory findings in previous
   research are due to a conceptual and empirical blurring of these two
   essentially different aspects.},

Abstract = {The Case for Conservatism is the first report of the Onward think tank's
   Commission on The Future of Conservatism. It examines present
   discontents and offers a set of principles for addressing them. It
   argues that Conservatives need to shift their ideological position away
   from the economic liberalism of Margaret Thatcher and the social
   liberalism of David Cameron and adopt a position which is socially
   conservative and economically interventionist in order to rebuild a
   successful electoral coalition and an effective programme for
   government. They seek to re-found Conservatism on the pillars of family,
   community and nation, and the obligations of citizenship rather than the
   freedom of the individual. They provide a distinctive voice on where
   Conservatism has gone wrong and how it should change, but they may
   struggle to become the dominant voice shaping the party's future,
   because the doctrines of economic liberalism still command strong
   support.},

Title = {International kidnapping by non-state actors: Exploring the relationship
   between political predictors and the selection of victims},
Journal = {DYNAMICS OF ASYMMETRIC CONFLICT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-95},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This study examines target selection by non-state actors who engage in
   international kidnapping. Existing literature addresses violence against
   specific victims, such as aid workers and journalists, and explores the
   attractiveness of these targets to kidnappers. However, studies fail to
   explore whether the political predictors of violence against aid workers
   or journalists are the same or different compared to other victim types.
   This study introduces a conceptual framework that assesses the political
   context of victimization, including the level of liberty in a state,
   foreign influence, extent of U.S. military and economic aid, degree of
   private sector development, region, and frequency of terrorism. Logistic
   regression is performed on a dataset of 579 victims, revealing a
   different combination of significant political predictors. This
   framework shows that the political environment varies across five
   categories of victims: aid workers, journalists, diplomats, business
   workers, and tourists. However, it remains unclear whether the political
   environment renders specific targets easier to abduct, whether those
   same conditions enhance the attractiveness of specific targets to
   non-state actors, or a combination of both. Nevertheless, knowledge of
   target selection preferences by non-state actors can inform policy that
   seeks to reduce the frequency of international kidnapping by recognizing
   the vulnerability of specific targets.},

Abstract = {The World Socialism Forum, sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Social
   Sciences (CASS), is an important international forum held regularly
   since 2004. Centered on the latest situations and changes in China and
   the world, the forum has attracted increasing attention both inside and
   outside China. The 13th World Socialism Forum was held in Beijing on
   November 28-29, 2023, with more than 180 leaders of communist parties,
   left-wing scholars, and social activists from 37 countries on six
   continents in attendance. Addressing the theme of ``Building a Community
   with a Shared Future for Humanity and the Development of World
   Socialism,{''} the participants discussed the significance of the
   concept of a community with a shared future for humanity and related
   questions, speaking highly of the achievements of the Chinese path to
   modernization and its exemplary role for developing countries. They also
   analyzed the profound crisis of present-day capitalism and the
   alternative prospects for socialism, while pointing out that as the
   world enters a new period of turbulence and transformation, and faces
   the challenges of hegemonism and power politics, the future of mankind
   lies in building a community with a shared future for humanity. This
   task requires the solidarity and cooperation of socialist forces around
   the world.},

Abstract = {What drives insurgency in fragile states? Is insurgency sustenance a
   function of ideology, economy, or something else? These and other
   questions have confronted scholars and government officials since the
   advent of insurgency activities in Nigeria's Northeast region. These
   questions are germane as actions and inaction taken to eradicate
   insurgency and its disruptive actions have met with little success.
   Using primary and survey data, this article probes and contextualizes
   the factors that spawned insurgency activities in the region including
   its adaptive features. The purpose of the article is further to assess
   policy options that could help contain and eradicate insurgent

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Abstract = {Gender-sensitive parliaments are an emergent international norm.
   Research primarily focused on parliaments as gendered workplaces
   functioning with formal and informal rules and routines that either
   constrain or promote gender equality. We shift the focus to
   parliamentary groups and parties in public office as key actors in
   achieving a gender-sensitive parliament. We argue that they play a
   crucial role in many parliamentary systems and can actively contribute
   to gender-sensitive transformations. Building on the gender-sensitive
   parliament literature, we first explore the potential of parliamentary
   groups to improve parliamentary functioning across four aspects:
   representation, policy-making, engagement with societal interests, and
   groups as gender-sensitive workplaces. Secondly, we delve into the
   broader parliamentary and party contexts, recognizing how factors such
   as the diversity of parliamentary systems, organizational structures,
   parties in central office, and political dynamics shape parliamentary
   groups' room for manoeuvre. We conclude by calling for further
   empirical, but especially conceptual, research to develop
   intersectionality-sensitive parliaments which we suggest are crucial for
   dismantling existing power hierarchies based on social markers.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL THOUGHT},

Abstract = {``Good moral character{''} and acts of ``moral turpitude{''} remain
   significant US standards for citizenship hopefuls and potential
   deportees. However, there is little scholarship examining whether
   morality standards have been used as effective exclusionary tools in the
   history of US immigration law. This article addresses this incomplete
   picture by raising topical questions about democratic process in
   lawmaking and prompting historical reassessment of moral expectations as
   barriers to immigration. It highlights the leading role of federal
   appellate judge Learned Hand in exposing the interpretive challenges
   that moral-based standards presented to courts in the early to
   mid-twentieth century. The article argues that Hand attempted to reduce
   the discretionary scope of judges by relying on society's ``common
   conscience{''} to decide legal disputes in this deeply subjective field
   of law. However, in applying this more layered, context-specific view of
   moral standard, Hand also exposed flaws in his own philosophical
   adherence to judicial restraint.},

Abstract = {This work analyzes the performance of the current export pattern of
   producti-ve specialization in Latin America after the global economic
   crisis of 2008. It maintains that in the 2010 decade and the beginning
   of the following decade, the region suffered the exhaustion of said
   pattern as a product of the measures and responses by global capital to
   confront the fall in profit rates caused by the Great Recession and
   stimulate the share of surplus value within the framework of the current
   international division of labor. Thus, Latin America suffered from the
   slowdown in its external trade; low economic dynamism; production
   stagnation; reduction of public resources and expenses; decline in
   income redistribution; growth of labor informality; increased
   unemployment and high levels of poverty and inequality, which resulted
   in a further deterio-ration in living conditions and the exacerbation of
   the super-exploitation of work.},

   accompany the quest for ethical conduct on the part of the faithful, the
   religious institution takes on different guises over time. Initially,
   during the youth of the faithful in Turkey, the institution was
   omnipresent in transmitting self-ethical techniques to students
   undergoing moral training. Now that they have become professional
   activists, the faithful are led to put their ethical conduct into
   practice as missionaries in sub-Saharan Africa under the guidance of a
   less visible, but no less enveloping, institution.},

Abstract = {Do international organizations (IOs) help states to solve coordination
   problems over policy choices? We analyze a formal model of coordinated
   adaptation in which states use costly signals to transmit information
   about their preferences. We show that states only delegate to IOs if
   states are sufficiently aligned and face little uncertainty about each
   other's preferences. Although states gain from delegation by achieving
   more policy coordination, they also incur more costs because of
   inefficient signaling. States misrepresent their preferences to ensure
   that policies are coordinated on their own preferred outcome, and
   delegation to IOs makes states want to misrepresent their preferences
   more strongly. This effect can be so strong that the gains from
   international coordination are insufficient to warrant delegation to
   IOs. We discuss the robustness of our results to different types of IOs
   and provide implications for the design of institutions.},

Title = {RESPONSIBLE URBAN DEVELOPMENT POLICY: CRITERIA, SUBJECTS, PROSPECTS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {5},
Pages = {102-120},
Abstract = {This article examines the primary directions of contemporary urban
   development policy, along with the issues and contradictions associated
   with its scientific research and practical implementation. The study
   aims to conceptualize the concept of ``responsible urban development{''}
   as a complex of approaches and practices that hold promise for
   integration into practical urban and regional development policies, and
   to typologize potential approaches to implementing such policies. The
   authors use an institutional approach, the methodology of identity
   studies, the structural-functional approach and a case study. The
   article investigates quantitative and qualitative indicators, the key
   challenges and tasks of urban development policy, with a particular
   focus on the resources of modern urban development. The authors note
   that relying on a limited set of indicators does not provide the
   capacity for decision-making necessary to update and transform urban
   development policy to ensure its ability to promptly and flexibly
   respond to the numerous problems and challenges arising under conditions
   of socio-political instability. The article addresses and analyses
   several cases of contemporary urban development and the implementation
   of corresponding policies. Based on this analysis, the authors conclude
   that one of the central and most pressing issues in the policy of
   responsible urban development and the socio-political dynamics of cities
   is the inefficiency of the communication process between civil actors
   and stakeholders, on the one hand, and city authorities and the city
   administration, on the other. This communication deficit can only be
   partially addressed through digitalization, as the primary obstacles to
   improved communication are administrative barriers and the dominance of
   the interests of certain groups, such as large corporations and
   financial institutions},

   de Fontanès and politics in 1950's Calabria},
Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2024},
Number = {33},
Abstract = {When French ethnologist Monique Roussel de Fontan \& egrave;s from the
   Mus \& eacute;e de l'Homme decided to make Calabria her main field of
   investigation in the early 1950's, the Mezzogiorno was of great
   importance for Italian ethnography, but also for political and cultural
   debates in Italy. While many folklorists and ethnologists were more or
   less compromised by fascism, those who took part in the discipline's
   refoundation after the war, like Ernesto De Martino, often chose to make
   a commitment to socialism or communism. French ethnology and Monique
   Roussel de Fontan \& egrave;s took a different stance and tried to
   practise their discipline in an apolitical way. Along with her status as
   a foreigner in Italy, this choice allowed her to make contact with many
   different people, from the great Calabrian landowners to the communist
   activists. This allowed her to enrich her fieldwork, but also to make
   observations about the political situation, which she discussed not in
   her publications but in her personal letters. Her presence int the field
   reveals both the positions and the objectives of the various actors, and
   the epistemological and political stakes of ethnology.},

Title = {Gender Sensitizing Parliaments: Reflections on Becoming a Feminist
   Academic Critical Actor},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Informed by my secondment to the UK Parliament in 2015-2016, and the
   production and reception of The Good Parliament report-which offered a
   blueprint for a diversity-sensitive House of Commons-this article
   reflects on my experiences becoming a feminist academic critical actor.
   This new type of critical actor extends the conceptualization first
   developed by Childs and Krook (2006, 2008). A distinctiveness vis.
   Chappell and Mackay's (2021) concept of the ``feminist critical
   friend{''} is also drawn: In addition to researching institutional
   change and supporting others in their reform work, the feminist academic
   critical actor is essential to instigate and institute institutional
   change. In this, the feminist academic critical actor is engaged in
   quotidian persuasion work and is both the agent as well as the analyst
   of research, critically reflecting on the dynamics and actors of
   institutional status, change, and resistance, including their own acts,
   in situ and after. In making the case for the feminist academic critical
   actor, the academic is recognized as doing something different, begging
   important questions of responsibility and accountability, and the
   opportunities and costs of engaging in such acts, particularly for
   minoritized and/or precarious academics. In the latter part of the
   article, I sketch out some of the dilemmas located in the questioning of
   my authority and legitimacy, and concerning the harm that I faced as a
   relatively privileged aspirant feminist academic critical actor, acting
   to rework the highly masculinized institution that is the UK House of
   Commons.},

Title = {Political Marketing Techniques: From Color to Election},
Journal = {ANALECTA POLITICA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {26},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {In the consumer goods landscape, a decisive move is related to the
   connections through which an image can be built, a position can be
   gained, a level of recognition can be obtained, and strategies can be
   devised for promoting a name, a brand, or an ideal. In the case of
   political marketing and the context of political representation and its
   place in the realm of campaigns and the electorate, the aim of this text
   is to identify its nature and foundations, its constituent elements, and
   its characteristics, in order to understand the relationship built
   between the political campaign and the communication strategies of a
   campaign. Based on a qualitative approach, the methodology used is
   quasi-experimental , descriptive, and exploratory, by posing and
   developing theories, applying their content to some objects-subjects of
   reality. Among the findings, it is worth emphasizing the relationship
   between political marketing and color theory, as well as the
   difficulties in finding a unified sense for the use of colors in
   electoral campaigns, and in this case, the use of the color blue.
   However, the question remains open to understanding the reasons for its
   preference and its winning influence.},

Abstract = {Despite their ubiquity, few have used traffic camera networks for social
   science research. Using 1,312,977 images collected from 768 London-based
   cameras leading up to the 2015 UK general election, this study not only
   demonstrates how traffic camera data can be used to effectively measure
   same-day turnout, but we also provide ways such data can be used to
   assess political behavior more broadly. Such automated enumeration is
   especially important in countries where official results are only
   returned for the current election, making it difficult for those
   interested in assessing turnout at lower levels of aggregation, even
   when those elections are next on the calendar. Although we are not the
   first to suggest the value of images-as-data, this study hopes to
   underline the importance of video-as-data, while simultaneously offering
   an important foundation for future research.},

Abstract = {From a long-term study of young migrants in France, this article
   examines how their relationships with institutions and their perception
   of their place in the society are co-constructed. It analyzes the
   consonances and dissonances between the experiences of different public
   policies, the indirect experiences of the State, and the contacts with
   other socialization instances (couple, family, media, peers, work,
   solidarity networks). The analysis highlights the interiorization of an
   outsider status that constitutes a minorized relationship with the
   State, but shows also how the internal discrepancies of public policies
   can lead these young people to identify themselves to the French society
   while feeling excluded from it. By shedding light on an aspect of
   migration still largely unknown, this article ultimately contributes to
   a comprehensive and longitudinal understanding of shaping of the way the
   governed see and act.},

Abstract = {By matching and contrasting electoral registry data with information
   gathered through a survey conducted with candidates for municipal and
   state legislative offices in the State of Morelos during the 2021-2022
   electoral process, the effectiveness of electoral quotas for people with
   disabilities, Afrodescendants, and lGBTIQ+ individuals is examined. The
   study found that identity impersonation is more common among municipal
   candidates than among those running for legislative positions, and that
   some individuals self-identified as vulnerable groups are not registered
   as part of an electoral affirmative action by political parties. The
   findings of this study contribute to the affirmative action debates by
   reflecting on the barriers to descriptive representation,
   self-identification criteria, and factors behind identity impersonation.},

Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {54},
Abstract = {In Latin America, fundamental rights are often characterized by their
   lack of effective-ness. In this regional context, the New Latin American
   Constitutionalism aims to reinforce a system of hyper-presidentialism.
   While New Constitutionalism identifies a robust bill of rights, their
   political leaders have sought to capture constitutional justice. Once
   captured, constitutional justice has proven essential to val-idate a
   strategy aimed at concentrating power in the president. To achieve this
   goal, the American Convention on Human Rights has been interpreted in
   abusive and disloyal terms. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has
   responded to this threat by reinforcing judicial independence,
   prohibiting unlimited presidential re-election, and reiterating the
   mandatory nature of its judgments. However, the principle of
   effectiveness and democracy still require systemic reforms in the
   Interamerican System of Human Rights for the system to reach its full
   potential.},

   and accountability},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {128},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {This paper dealt with the theme of governance and best practices in the
   light of the Brazilian Lei Geral de Prote \& ccedil;\& atilde;o de Dados
   Pessoais (LGPD), focusing on compliance procedures, survey and risk
   management, in addition to the accountability principle. The main goal
   of this paper was to answer: which elements of governance and best
   practices should be used to effectively be compliant to LGPD? The
   deductive approach method was adopted as the research methodology, with
   exploratory-bibliographic analysis. The specific goals of the paper
   were: to study compliance, the accountability principle and the
   mechanisms of risk management in order to establish data governance in
   organizations; analyze the data impact report as a way to mitigate risks
   and preserve the rights and freedoms of the data subjects; to examine
   foreign experiences, especially from the European Union as models for
   privacy and data protection governance and best practices for Brazil. It
   is concluded that compliance in the area of privacy and data protection
   is a way for the State transfer part of its powers to the private
   entity. Even so, a structured risk management program and governance
   built with attention to the accountability principle are advantages for
   institutions, promoting financial stability, business integrity and the
   preservation of reputation.},

Title = {Politicised at Home but not in Council: The European Coordination of
   Social Security Systems},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {After seven years of negotiations, the European Parliament and the
   Council have yet to agree on the reform of one of the most essential
   regulations facilitating cross-border worker mobility in the EU: the
   Coordination of Social Security Systems (EC 883/2004). The lack of
   agreement remains puzzling, as all negotiating partners are generally in
   favour of the reform. Similar proposals on social policy, such as the
   Posting Workers Directive or the Minimum-wage Directive, were also
   challenging to achieve but could be agreed upon. This article tests
   whether ``unpolitics{''}-a destructive approach by populist governments
   in the Council to undermine EU policymaking-is the reason for the
   persisting deadlock on the file. The central finding this article is
   that the interplay of populism and the status of member states as
   sending or receiving workers shape unpolitical behaviour. Contrary to
   expectations, unpolitics is largely absent in the behaviour populist and
   non-populist governments. Unpolitical behaviour does not promise high
   gains for the populist governments from Central and Eastern Europe
   because these member states send workers. The smooth functioning of the
   freedom of workers is essential for them and their national discourses
   do not discuss the freedom of movement in the context of welfare
   chauvinism. Welfare chauvinism is much stronger countries that receive
   workers, however, populists were not in power in these member states and
   therefore there was no unpolitical behaviour. The findings show that
   unpolitical behaviour is not used by mainstream governments, not even
   when it would seem likely from the nature of the policy issue. This
   article highlights that the probability of unpolitical behavior is
   influenced not only by the nature of the policy issue itself but also by
   domestic institutional and structural factors, as well as the national
   discourse.},

Abstract = {Although a subset of political scientists has been studying climate
   change for decades, the mainstream of the discipline lags behind.
   Journals such as Global Environmental Politics and even Nature and
   Science have long published political science research on climate, yet
   major disciplinary journals tend to marginalize climate and
   environmental politics more broadly (Green and Hale 2017). This trend
   has been changing slowly (as evidenced by this symposium), but
   mainstream political science still has much catching up to do.},

   Norwegian Nasjonal Samling},
Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2024},
Number = {32},
Abstract = {This paper analyses the complex relationship between ideas of
   corporatism, the Norwegian fascist party Nasjonal Samling (National
   Unity, NS), fascist Italy, and fascist internationalism in the 1930s. It
   demonstrates how the NS fused the foreign corporative model provided by
   fascist Italy with nativist traditions and used corporatism to its ends
   as a signifier for a national and international `new order' on the rise,
   based on ideas of solidarity. The NS party manifesto from 1934
   envisioned corporatism as a promising alternative to capitalist
   liberalism and as a solution to the parliamentary crisis. The
   corporatist NS program also facilitated connections between the
   Norwegian party and Italian Fascism, culminating in the idea of
   corporatism as a uniting principle of fascist internationalism in the
   mid-1930s. Finally, the paper discusses briefly the legacy of the
   corporatist NS program and its fragmentary implementation in the 1940s
   during the German occupation of Norway (1940-1945).},

Abstract = {Conspiracy Dangerous The emergence in the post-global world of diverse
   and articulated forms of conspiracy theories with anti-Semitic spin-offs
   occurs against the backdrop of four hinges and changes in social and
   political life: the erosion of the value of cosmopolitan memory, the
   structural change of the digital public sphere, the irruption of
   populist forces, and geopolitical changes rooted in history. In the
   generalized distrust regarding the truth and plausibility of public
   discourse and the climate of epistemic uncertainty, antisemitic
   conspiracy theories represent a veritable cross-cultural subculture. But
   the contingency of their proliferation leads one to reflect on the
   relevance of some of the insights of the Frankfurt School of Critical
   Theory.},

   perceived attitudes of foreign students. The research was based on an
   analysis of a questionnaire carried out at Constantine the Philosopher

   interpret one's own behaviour more positively than it is perceived by
   others. Moreover, the analysis revealed some of the causes of a negative
   attitude towards foreigners. Variables as age and language barrier were
   confirmed to be significant when forming an attitude towards foreigners.},

Abstract = {The special constitutional relevance is a critic dialogical instrument
   from the perspective of multilevel constitutionalism and, especially, is
   a privileged conversational element between the Spanish Constitutional
   Court and the European Court of Human Rights. The need to adapt the
   constitutional jurisprudence of the Spanish Constitutional Court to the
   case law of the European Court of Human Rights as a cause of special
   constitutional relevance institutionalizes a practice already followed
   by the Constitutional Court by virtue of art 10.2 of the Spanish
   Constitution. Now, in addition, two further aspects are incorporated: a
   principle of collaboration between the appellants in amparo and the
   Court in the detection of new developments in the international systems,
   and the reinforcement of the Constitutional Court as a principal mean
   for channeling the European jurisprudence to ordinary justice.},

Abstract = {War as a political and social phenomenon is one of the central subjects
   in political science and international studies. This is one issue where
   theory and practice are intertwined most closely and updated most
   frequently since each new military conflict discovers new facets of war
   and peace for researchers, military and policy-making circles. This
   theme nests a number of related disciplines and subtopics some of which
   have become especially relevant amidst growing interstate rivalry on a
   global scale and in certain regions of the world. What do
   ``containment{''} and ``escalation{''} mean today? To what extent is a
   state's foreign policy strategy determined by its ``strategic
   culture{''}? How relevant are the ideas of the great military thinkers
   of the past to modern and future wars? At the center of all these
   stories is the issue of the evolution of means of armed struggle: how
   they are changing and what humanity can come to as a result of the
   ``arrogance of force{''} of some states. To discuss these and other
   matters, Comparative Politics Russia sat down with Dr. Kokoshin, one of
   Russia's leading experts in the field of military-political,
   socio-economic and technological aspects of international and national

Journal = {POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {112},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The article presents the results of testing the hypothesis, according to
   which ballot stuffing in favor of the ``party in power{''}, while
   causing minor distortions to the structure of electoral cleavages, does
   not fundamentally change it. The author tested the hypothesis on the
   data from the 2016 and 2021 elections to the State Duma of the Russian
   Federation held via proportional system rules. He used the following
   method: in the regions where ballot stuffing was allegedly used in favor
   of the United Russia party, a certain number of votes were subtracted
   from the United Russia electoral results in accordance with the
   difference between the maximum and effective ranges of the electoral
   cleavage related to the confrontation between of the United Russia and
   the rest of elections' participants. The author employed two models to
   run calculations: in the first model the threshold for deduction was a
   difference of 50\% between the maximum and effective range, in the
   second model the difference was 5\%. For 2016 elections, the first model
   took away more than 6.1 million votes from the United Russia, the second
   model subtracted more than 12.5 million votes; for 2021 elections - more
   than 5 and more than 10 million votes, respectively. Nevertheless, there
   was no radical change in the structure of electoral cleavages, let alone
   its elimination. The study showed that although ballot stuffing in favor
   of the ``party in power{''} artificially overemphasizes the role of the
   authoritarian-democratic confrontation, sidelining other confrontations,
   the structure of electoral cleavages per se is largely preserved.
   Mathematical methods, especially factor analysis, can be efficiently
   used to detect this structure.},

Abstract = {Salvemini analyses the Risorgimento issue from a democratic perspective.
   The essay focuses the attention on his analysis. Salvemini opposes the
   laudatory readings about Cavourian liberal moderatism and criticises the
   bureaucratic centralization of the new State. He is federalist, but he
   acknowledges the inapplicability of Cattaneo's federalism in the
   immediate post-Unification period. Although Salvemini later reassesses
   the historical role of Cavour and his heirs, he doesn't change his
   opinion about the Risorgimento. He can't consider it a democratic
   revolution. He's convinced it was a << revolution of the rich >>.},

   South America},
Journal = {POLITICA Y GOBIERNO},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Latin American party systems are characterized by a proliferation of new
   parties of very different sizes, backgrounds, and developmental
   trajectories, which poses a conceptual challenge. Historically,
   conceptualizations of new parties have often prioritized data
   accessibility over methodological and theoretical rigor. As a result,
   they have produced a plethora of highly heterogeneous cases that are
   ill-suited for theory testing. To address this problem, we propose the
   development of a conceptual tool aimed at identifying a subset of
   relevant new parties, termed ``break-in parties{''} ( Bip ) because of
   their potential impact on prevailing patterns of representation and
   party competition. We have identified a corpus of 24 such parties
   founded between 1960 and 2002 in South America. These parties exhibit
   sufficient similarity to facilitate meaningful attributions, while also
   providing variability in relevant independent and dependent variables
   for testing theories of party system change through the emergence and
   success of new parties, a topic that has received considerable attention
   in recent years.},

Abstract = {Can artificial intelligence accurately label open-text survey responses?
   We compare the accuracy of six large language models (LLMs) using a
   few-shot approach, three supervised learning algorithms (SVM,
   DistilRoBERTa, and a neural network trained on BERT embeddings), and a
   second human coder on the task of categorizing ``most important
   issue{''} responses from the British Election Study Internet Panel into
   50 categories. For the scenario where a researcher lacks existing
   training data, the accuracy of the highest-performing LLM (Claude-1.3:
   93.9\%) neared human performance (94.7\%) and exceeded the
   highest-performing supervised approach trained on 1000 randomly sampled
   cases (neural network: 93.5\%). In a scenario where previous data has
   been labeled but a researcher wants to label novel text, the best LLM's
   (Claude-1.3: 80.9\%) few-shot performance is only slightly behind the
   human (88.6\%) and exceeds the best supervised model trained on 576,000
   cases (DistilRoBERTa: 77.8\%). PaLM-2, Llama-2, and the SVM all
   performed substantially worse than the best LLMs and supervised models
   across all metrics and scenarios. Our results suggest that LLMs may
   allow for greater use of open-ended survey questions in the future.},

Title = {Social representations of masculinity in parliamentary discourse in
   Chile},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Although policy design is one of the spaces for the institutional
   configuration of the gender order, academic research on the processes of
   law production is practically non-existent. Consequently, this study
   aims to unveil the social representations of masculinity present in the
   Chilean parliamentary discourse within the framework of the processing
   of Law 20.047, which regulates paternity leave. Considering a
   qualitative approach, a phenomenological design, and information
   collection through doc-umentary review in the digital archives of the
   National Congress Library, a textual corpus was obtained and subjected
   to a structural analysis of discourse. The results show a parliamentary
   discourse that overvalues biological fatherhood and reduces its practice
   to accompanying maternity. It also demonstrates an equitable image of
   the rights and duties that men and women have regarding their children
   and a mode of thinking that highlights the involvement of young men in
   reproductive tasks. All of this reveals a representation of masculinity
   in which traditional belief systems converge with more egalitarian
   cognitive frameworks and which presents differences according to sex and
   political sector},

Abstract = {This essay raises the possibility of developing a new model of
   collective, nonalienating spirituality from an organized Marxist and
   Christian paradigm. For this, it addresses the notion of spirituality
   from different perspectives and the role that religious alienation plays
   in its development. Likewise, it addresses the relationship that Marxism
   and Christianity have maintained respectively throughout history,
   reading certain concepts of critical philosophy, as well as the Marxist
   theory itself, studying their similarities and discrepancies, the
   difficulties that their linkage has entailed, in the same way as the
   experiences of communion that they have shared during the last decades,
   paying special attention to the case of Latin America.},

Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The title of my article is somewhat misleading. I never was and never
   wanted to be a ``politico{''}. By chance and, perhaps, virtue, I
   consider it a great honor and a high distinction to have been the first
   Italian Professor of Political Science to be elected as Senator to the
   Italian Parliament, for three terms 1983-1987; 1987-1992; 1994-1996. My
   reflections on why, when, and how will hopefully throw some light on
   Italian politics and on political science in general and, of course, on
   the relationship between politics and political science and viceversa.
   There may follow some lessons for the profession and the discipline, for
   politics and the political actors. Many of those lessons I have tried to
   transfer into my writings. Hence, the readers will find references to
   the articles and books I have written during my productive life. In this
   article, my writings are intended to illuminate the problems I will be
   discussing, to identify the sources of my thinking and to suggest what
   remains to be done. Fortunately, or not in politics and in the study of
   politics, always and everywhere a lot remains to be done with old and
   new problems, looking for old, and forgotten, and new teachings.
   Political science is not the only answer, but it is the one I have
   practiced and still consider the most promising, preferable, and
   intellectually and politically the most rewarding.},

Title = {Philippines: Diaspora and Homeland Conflict. Locating the Moro Diaspora
   in the Mindanao Insurgency},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Number = {46},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {An ever-expanding body of literature suggests the possible link between
   diasporas and the exacerbation of civil wars in their home countries.
   One of the most notable findings on the link between diaspora and armed
   conflict is derived from a set of arguments known as the Greed and
   Grievances Thesis. According to the said framework, a higher diasporic
   support to a homeland conflict is positively correlated with a higher
   incidence of civil war intractability. Applying this framework to the
   data on external support to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
   insurgency from 1990-2008, the study notes that there is a lack of
   support from the Moro diaspora which forced the MILF to secure peace
   with the Philippine government. On the contrary, the increase in
   conflict activities during the insurgency can be qualitatively
   attributed to the economic and political support from hostile states and
   international terrorist networks that support the Moro insurgents
   against the Philippine government. The study concludes that there is an
   absence of substantial evidence on the role of the Moro diaspora in
   funding the insurgents due to other factors such as internal financing
   for the rebellion and the role of international actors in prolonging the
   Moro conflict.},

Title = {Political Revenge? Downgrading Indonesia's KPK From Hero to Villain},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {The importance of Indonesia's Corruption Eradication Commission (Komisi
   Pemberantasan Korupsi {[}KPK]), has once again been brought into focus
   during the 2024 presidential election campaign period when politics and
   corruption collide. This article suggests that legislative and political
   actions since 2019 to the KPK's purpose and structure severely limit its
   capacity and independence making it susceptible to greater political
   interference and coercion. The KPK was established by Law 30/2002, as a
   response to and recognition of rampant corruption throughout the
   governmental, political and public sectors, business communities, and
   society in general, which became common practice during President
   Suharto's New Order Regime. The KPK's commission encompasses conducting
   investigations, indictments, and prosecutions. However, in late 2019,
   the People's Representative Council enacted amending legislation to
   weaken its authority and ability to operate independently. Crucial
   legislative changes included creating a government-appointed supervisory
   body overseeing the KPK's internal operations and changing KPK employee
   status from independent agents to public servants. These two provisions
   alone seriously weaken the KPK's autonomy and create the risk of turning
   it into a politically controlled auxiliary state agency. In some
   respects, KPK has become a victim of its own successes, having achieved
   convictions of senior ministers, politicians, government officials, and
   business leaders, which in turn has produced enemies. Without political
   protection, the KPK faces the prospect of not only becoming, in essence,
   a nonentity but also facing further deterioration of its credibility and
   authority.},

Abstract = {The events of February 2022 became the starting point of a new wave of
   Russian emigration. On the one hand, this phenomenon can be considered
   within a series of previous migration waves, on the other hand, the
   modern context leaves its imprint on the current migration process,
   making it very special from the economic and sociocultural perspectives.
   The article presents an attempt to analyze this specificity with an
   emphasis on the characteristics of the economic behavior of emigrants.
   Empirically, the study is based on a series of in-depth interviews with
   people who left Russia after February 2022. On the basis of these
   interviews, the authors built idealized cognitive models of possible
   options for the economic behavior of migrants. The authors considered a
   total of four models: relocation, which involves searching for a job in
   the host country; relocation, which involves remote work for a Russian
   company; relocation, which involves creating or moving one's own
   business; relocation to a branch of a Russian company. Since the
   economic strategies of migrants are influenced by signals broadcast by
   the Russian government structures, the article analyzed the statements
   of representatives of these structures using the method of network
   cognitive mapping, which made it possible to reveal two types of
   official discourse in relation to those who left Russia, which differed
   in the extent of their criticism towards them. In general, the study
   showed that migrants of the latest wave are internally heterogeneous and
   fall into several groups that differ markedly in their motivation and
   patterns of economic behavior. At the same time, a significant part of
   them continues to cooperate with Russia in one way or another and, in
   principle, is ready to return to Russia. For them, migration is driven
   largely by security and/or economic reasons. Only a minority of
   emigrants left the coun-try due to their disagreement with the current
   political course and consider the possibility of coming back only if the
   political course changes radically.},

Abstract = {This thematic issue discusses the design, implementation, and impact of
   youth -oriented active labour market policies in Europe, with a
   particular emphasis on its peripheries. The need to address
   territorialised, youth -oriented active labour market policies is
   pressing for several reasons. For one, the whole socioeconomic paradigm
   is undergoing fundamental changes due to the dual transition (digital
   and green) that is expected to have an impact on the rural/urban divide.
   Moreover, at the subnational level, youth unemployment in certain
   regions is a more pressing problem than suggested by existing studies,
   which have mostly focused on the national level. This implies that
   closer inspection of the subnational level, in general, and the
   peripheral regions, in particular, will reveal more marked cross
   -national differences. This thematic issue offers a point of departure
   for the suggested territorialised approach to the study of how active
   labour market policies for young people are formulated and implemented,
   and which effects they have on their target groups.},

Title = {THE PROCESS OF ``DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING{''} IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IN
   THE PERIOD 2012 -2021},

Abstract = {The phenomenon of ``democratic backsliding{''} is becoming a topical
   issue in today's international relations, with recent occurrences in
   various regions, including Europe. This paper examines the weakening of
   democracy in the Russian Federation from 2012 to 2021. The study aims to
   determine whether democratic elements were dismantled in Russia during
   this period. For this purpose, the theoretical framework by Ellen Lust
   and David Waldner was utilized, alongside Merkel's concept of embedded
   democracy. Appropriate indicators were selected to reliably reveal the
   deterioration in the quality of democratic institutions and processes in
   Russia, specifically the Freedom House index, Democracy Index, and the
   Bertelsmann Transformation Index (BTI). By employing these three
   indices, the study assesses whether Russia can be classified as an
   anchored democracy or a defective democracy. The findings, presented in
   the final section of the paper, indicate significant erosion of
   democratic practices and institutions in Russia during the observed
   period. This deterioration underscores a shift from an already flawed
   democratic structure to one that increasingly resembles an authoritarian
   regime. The study concludes that Russia cannot be considered an anchored
   democracy; rather, it exhibits numerous characteristics of a defective
   democracy, marked by weakened institutions and diminished political
   freedoms.},

Title = {POLITICAL REALISM BETWEEN AMERICAN REPUBLICANISM AND GERMAN ELITISM},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},

Pages = {166-179},
Abstract = {The focus of this study is a discussion between the representative of
   classical realism, H. Morgenthau, and the American theorists of
   republicanism, J. Calhoun and W. Sumner. The author argues that
   Morgenthau was proving the limitations of republican political theory.
   For this purpose, Morgenthau developed the concept of political power of
   the German theory of elitism. The content of the study is divided into
   three parts. First, the term ``power{''} is analyzed in the political
   writings of representatives of German elitism of the Weimar Republic K.
   Schmitt, O. Spengler and E. J \& uuml;nger. Next, the role of the
   concepts of ``self-government{''} and ``commonwealth{''} in Calhoun and
   Sumner's theory is explored. Finally, the author shows how Morgenthau
   engages the notion of ``power{''} against the conceptual foundations of
   republican theory. The methodology of the study is based on the
   principles of analyzing political texts formulated by representatives of
   the Cambridge School of the History of Ideas. This methodology allows us
   to focus on the theorist's motivation to solve a political problem with
   the help of a set of concepts that are relevant to the current debate.
   The main conclusion of the study is that Morgenthau, in a polemic with
   republican theorists, constructed an image of the American empire of the
   Western Hemisphere, giving full authority to the central government and
   relegating the key republican principle of federalism to a way of
   decentralizing power at the regional level. Morgenthau's victory in the
   debates with republican theorists also allows us to conclude that the
   establishment of the ideas of realism in the American science of
   international relations contributed to the transformation of the United
   States from a republic into a new centralized empire.},

Abstract = {Since the beginning of the war of aggression against Ukraine, Russia's
   occupation authorities have abducted tens of thousands of children and
   sent them to locations elsewhere within the occupied territories or to
   Russia and given them over to adoption. The abduction of minors and
   their Russification through assimilation presumably constitute genocide.
   In March 2023, the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued an
   arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Commissioner for
   Children's Rights Media L'vova-Belova on suspicion of committing a war
   crime. Only a fraction of the abducted children have been able to return
   to their Ukrainian guardians.},

Abstract = {The evolution of US migration policy has run several cycles: at first,
   the fate of immigrants was the responsibility of the employer
   (companies, who brought them to the USA), then, with an increase in
   their influx and their gradual resettlement, the lives of newcomers
   began to be determined at the state level. Only at the end of the 19th
   century migration regulation began to acquire the features of the
   federal government's established policy with a vector towards
   liberalization throughout the next century. Starting from the 2010s
   there is a reverse trend - back to restrictionism and `descend' of the
   regulation to the level of state authorities, especially for illegal
   immigrants. Such shift causes a clash between states and federal
   government, and at the same time emphasises the inability of this
   government to carry out objectively aspired reform. Today immigration
   policy in the United States can be divided into two major areas: legal
   immigration regulation and government attempts to solve the problem of
   illegal immigration. This division, albeit conditionally, helps to
   understand why for 30 years now no Congress has been able to work out a
   comprehensive immigration reform or at least agree on key areas for the
   implementation of its' certain aspects. A set of acute problems of
   socio-economic, moral and ethical nature forms an inseparable set of
   challenges. It equally includes both the areas necessary for the
   country's successful economic development: highly qualified personnel
   attraction, aging of the nation combating, increase of the birth rate,
   and the challenges associated with the burden on society and the
   increase in crime: the influx of refugees, illegal, seasonal and
   permanent immigrants and their families. Due to domestic political
   peculiarities in the modern United States, party coalitions cannot agree
   on even one of these areas, let alone develop a profound working system
   that meets constantly changing needs of the economy, foreign policy
   challenges, and is in consensus with states' authorities, who would
   finally assimilate newcomers. Will the current crisis on the
   southwestern border of the United States affect J. Biden's reelection in
   November 2024? What strategy has D. Trump chosen to bypass his rival? -
   you will find from this article.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Unlike other key party system properties (e.g. fragmentation,
   volatility), polarization lacks a publicly available cross-national and
   longitudinal dataset that can be used as an established source among the
   scientific community. This article aims to fill this gap by introducing
   a novel publicly available dataset of party system ideological
   polarization in Western European party systems. The dataset relies on
   multiple expert surveys and provides measures of party system
   ideological polarization for each parliamentary election and legislature
   in 20 Western European countries since 1945. The article also presents
   party system polarization's comparative longitudinal trends, drivers,
   and links with other key party system properties. It finds that party
   system ideological polarization is on the rise in Western Europe, mainly
   due to a progressive shift in the electoral support from ideologically
   moderate mainstream parties to more extreme challenger parties.
   Moreover, in recent years, high party system polarization has recurred
   in highly fragmented and volatile contexts, thus creating a detrimental
   context for the working of democracy.},

Abstract = {A number of authors make a seemingly compelling case for holding the
   victim of a wrong morally obliged to accept the genuine apology of the
   wrongdoer. This is a crucial issue in questions of reparative justice,
   since reparation typically requires not just the giving but also the
   acceptance of an apology. Yet it is a case that we should ultimately
   reject. If it is credible to think that the victim might suffer anew in
   exercising any duty of this kind, that suffering must be factored into
   the moral reckoning from the outset. It is only if we can be sure that
   the victim will not suffer again by attending to, and ultimately
   accepting, the wrongdoer's apology that it would be right to impose upon
   her any duty of this kind. Yet, in all non-trivial cases, the victim's
   burden is unknowable in advance and has the potential to be
   considerable. In such situations, I argue, the victim has no duty to
   accept the wrongdoer's apology. There are limits, too, to the utility of
   the bipartite victim-wrongdoer account of reparation on which such
   arguments are typically predicated. For the harm the wrongdoer causes is
   not exclusively suffered by the immediate victim but also by the
   community of all potential victims. Genuine reparative justice requires
   more than a recalibration of the relative moral standing of the
   wrongdoer and the victim through the giving and receiving of an apology.
   I consider how this might be achieved without imposing upon the victim a
   burden that fails to achieve the moral reckoning anticipated.},

Title = {Is EU democracy promotion aligned with local media perception in Central
   Asia? Findings from content analysis},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},

Abstract = {In the 2019 European Union (EU) renewed Strategy for Central Asia, the
   promotion of democracy in the post-soviet republics of Kazakhstan,
   Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan is singled out as
   one of the key priorities. This article aims to examine whether there is
   an alignment between the EU self-perception on democracy promotion and
   its external perception in local media. The question is addressed
   through quantitative and qualitative content analysis of the EU key
   documents for Central Asia and local media outlets from 2019 to 2022,
   using the Nvivo software. The research findings indicate that both self-
   and external perceptions align in the context of the EU human rights
   promotion for Central Asia. Drawing upon these findings, this article
   argues that the EU democracy promotion endeavours are predominantly
   grasped in Central Asia within the sphere of human rights, while
   comprehension of other facets of the EU democracy promotion agenda
   remains intricate. Consequently, as the EU normative agenda faces
   ongoing scrutiny within Central Asia, it is advocated that the EU
   undertake a thorough reassessment of its approach in the region, aiming
   to foster deeper understanding and alignment with local perceptions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 25},
Abstract = {In this research note, I explore the extent to which affectively
   polarized voters drive winner and loser effects in electoral confidence.
   Using panel data from the ANES 2016-2020 Panel Sample, I present
   statistical evidence suggesting that those who were most likely to
   express a different level of electoral confidence in 2020 relative to
   2016 were those who strongly ``liked{''} a candidate while
   simultaneously strongly ``disliking{''} that candidate's opponent. To a
   lesser extent, those who were more polarized in their feelings towards
   the Democratic and Republican Parties were also more likely to exhibit a
   change in electoral confidence. Additionally, affective polarization
   towards the candidates appears to play a greater role in electoral
   confidence than affective polarization towards political parties for
   less partisan voters. Taken together, the evidence suggests that
   movement in electoral confidence is largely an emotional reaction to the
   election results. This research highlights the consequences of the
   broader shift to candidate-focused campaigning on electoral confidence
   in American elections.},

Abstract = {Despite the attention that the topic of misinformation has received,
   there is a lack ofresearch on citizens'support for efforts to address
   the issue. Using data collected duringthe 2022 Quebec elections and
   bloc-recursive models, this article shows that support forinterventions
   against misinformation is generally high. However, individuals with a
   right-wing ideology, who support the Conservative Party of Quebec or
   lack trust in the mediaand scientists, are more likely to oppose them.
   Those who are not concerned about theissue, prioritize freedom of
   expression, or are vulnerable to misinformation are also lessfavorable.
   The results suggest that working on depoliticizing misinformation
   debatesand strengthening trust in institutions could increase the
   perceived legitimacy and effec-tiveness of our response to
   misinformation.},

   populist radical right ideology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 23},
Abstract = {Nativism, authoritarianism, and populism are traditionally regarded as
   the defining ideological dimensions of populist radical right parties.
   However, authoritarianism in party discourse is under-theorized and it
   has received little empirical scrutiny compared to the other two
   dimensions. Building on the psychology literature on the concept, I
   provide an updated definition of authoritarianism that consists of three
   subdimensions: the identification of threat, authoritarian submission to
   authority and norms, and authoritarian aggression toward deviants.
   Afterwards, I relate authoritarianism's definition to populism, finding
   that authoritarianism shares strong similarities with populism. It
   appears that populism can be seen as a specific manifestation of
   authoritarianism.},

Abstract = {James March's poetry and poems are an insightful, delightful, witty and
   aesthetic - yet ultimately marginalised - provocation. With a cheekiness
   that exploits his scholarly reputation while undermining it, he
   sympathetically debunks the managerial ethos (indeed ideology) of
   rational certainty and strategic purposiveness. In introducing his
   poems, we draw on (arche)typal tropes of the clown, pirate, poet and
   garbage collector to reveal how March's poetry provides valuable
   insights into the lived experience of paradox. In conclusion, we use his
   marginalised provocation to argue for a bearable lightness of being in
   using art to surface and address the challenges of living with paradox.},

Abstract = {Hayek regards the liberal democratic model of public opinion as
   totalitarian. This aggregated majority opinion is, he claims, a
   disposition to change others' behaviour. It operates directly or
   indirectly through the state's coercive power. To resist totalitarianism
   Hayek proposes to replace public opinion by an alternative type of
   aggregate opinion: general opinion. I argue that his shift from public
   opinion to general opinion transforms the state into a problematic locus
   for the shaping and disseminating of opinions and thereby turns the
   content of general opinion into irrefutable dogma. Both consequences
   are, contra Hayek, more rather than less likely to encourage
   totalitarianism. In justifying this analysis, I challenge the
   assumptions, framework, and claims of Hayek's political theory, offering
   fresh ways to understand Hayek's questionable conception of the state
   and demonstrate that, in replacing public opinion with general opinion,
   Hayek departs from the liberal political tradition he purports to
   defend.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the relationship between intra-party
   leadership contestations on levels of satisfaction with democracy among
   party voters, trying to identify the impact of the former on the latter.
   The article draws on empirical data for a cross-sectional analysis from
   three different data sets that cover 11 countries, including a more
   case-specific analysis that utilizes panel data from Germany. Overall,
   the study aims to capture the dynamics of intra-party politics and the
   magnitude of its effect on perceptions of democracy among parties'
   voters. We find that intra-party politics at its probably most
   competitive version, that is elections for the head of the party, does
   not seem to exercise any significant influence on voters' satisfaction
   with democracy.},

Title = {Do working-class candidates activate class-based voting?},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {92},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {After steadily leaving the Democratic Party, working-class voters are
   increasingly seen as pivotal in US elections. What type of candidates
   should parties nominate to win over working-class voters? Parties often
   nominate candidates based on characteristics they think will appeal to
   certain groups of voters. These typically include campaign messages,
   such as policy positions or rhetoric, but can also include descriptive
   characteristics. In this paper we use a conjoint experiment to test
   whether candidates' class background can activate classbased voting.
   Overall, we find that a candidate's occupation has a substantial effect
   on voter perceptions: working-class respondents are 6.4 percentage
   points more likely to prefer a candidate with a working-class occupation
   over one with an upper-class occupation. This effect is not driven by
   inferences that respondents make about candidates' policy positions or
   group-based rhetoric. Instead, we find that working-class voters
   perceive working-class candidates as more understanding of their
   problems. Our results suggest that candidates' class background is an
   underappreciated yet effective mechanism for activating class-based
   voting.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Month = {2024 DEC 5},
Abstract = {In order to understand the relevance of class politics and the changing
   composition of our politicians, we must first understand how the public
   derive their views of social class and, importantly, that of their
   elected representatives. If the social class of representatives is to
   matter, the public must be able to at least partly accurately infer the
   social class of representatives. This article addresses that question
   through a large conjoint experiment conducted in Britain (N = 4157). In
   addition to a wide range of social class cues, participants were
   randomly exposed to distinct information conditions where statements
   about the hypothetical profiles under consideration were of individuals
   with political experience or not. The findings reveal meaningful
   differences in how social class markers are perceived between Members of
   Parliament (MPs) and the general public. Notably, MPs are consistently
   viewed as less working class, even when they possess identical
   working-class attributes to an average member of the public. These
   results have implications for understanding how people derive the social
   class of others, especially elected representatives. The latter is
   important: the perceptual gap underscores a fundamental dilemma for the
   promotion of working-class representation in politics as working-class
   MPs are likely to struggle to be recognised as authentic representatives
   of the class groups they descriptively represent.},

Abstract = {We explore collective beliefs and gender stereotypes surrounding
   domestic violence. These stereotypes structure our perception of the
   social world while serving to justify and maintain power hierarchies.
   For example, the invisibility of violence in lesbian relationships fuels
   the idea that only heterosexual relationships can be violent, thus
   reinforcing the vision of exclusively male violence and depicting women
   as essentially passive. However, although violence between women exists,
   it is part of a different analysis of power relations on a structural
   level. Some minority groups could exploit these stereotypes for
   strategic purposes to enhance their social identity: lesbians, faced
   with homophobia, can represent their relationships as more egalitarian,
   which helps to counter negative stereotypes and stigmatization. This
   strategy can positively influence social perceptions, but it also risks
   reinforcing the binary conception of gender roles and minimizing real
   violence in lesbian couples. The difficulty therefore lies in using
   stereotypes to counter oppression while avoiding reinforcing the same
   beliefs and making urgent problems invisible.},

Abstract = {Disasters are unpleasant experiences, but disasters are part of the
   reality of human existence. Human activities have increased the rate,
   intensity and sources of disasters. Several studies have determined the
   role of risk communication, an emerging area of communication, in
   preventing and managing disasters. This study aims to verify the
   robustness of the claim that risk communication can influence responses
   in unfavorable situations, thereby reducing the possible consequences of
   disasters or leading to immediate avoidance. The theoretical framework
   for this study is the protection motivation theory and the extended
   parallel process model. Both theories explain how individuals behave
   when exposed to disaster threats and how risk communication can
   influence responses in threatening situations. This qualitative research
   collected data using focus group discussions involving 20 speakers who
   were purposively selected based on their experience in dealing with
   disasters in Mangu Local Government Area, Plateau State, Nigeria. This
   research findings validate risk communication as a proactive approach to
   reducing the consequences of disasters. The study suggests that
   government and professional bodies involved in risk communication should
   invest in capacity building in various skills and needs to earn the
   trust of their stakeholders to enhance the perceived credibility of
   their messages.},

   influence on the youth of the temporarily occupied territories of
   Ukraine. The comparative analysis made it possible to determine the main
   differences in the Russian strategy of de-Ukrainization of the child
   population of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, certain areas of Donbas
   and regions of Ukraine temporarily occupied by the armed forces of the
   Russian Federation in 2022. The approaches of the Russian
   military-political leadership and the occupation administrations
   controlled by them depended on the region, the length of its stay under
   the occupation, the intentions regarding the Ukrainian youth in the
   short-term and long-term perspectives: maintaining the level of loyalty
   to Russia and its regimes, forced mobilization, violent deportation,
   illegal adoption, etc.},

Abstract = {To what extent do contemporary critical theories of money operate under
   the shadow of Rousseau's sentimentalist horizon of natural equality
   corrupted by the advent of civilization? This article outlines a
   Derridean reading of Graeber's and Wengrow's recent anthropological
   study of prehistoric social formations in an effort to demonstrate the
   unacknowledged influence which Rousseau's disdain for theatricality
   holds over many present-day assumptions about the social logic of money.
   In an attempt to repudiate the orthodox theory of money as a medium of
   exchange, these anthropologists equate the origin of money with a
   predilection for adornments and self-display. As soon as money becomes a
   problem of representation, however, the critical discourse immediately
   shifts towards an anti-theatrical lamentation for lost authenticity
   which necessarily rehearses the circular logic of Rousseau's thought.
   Money ultimately becomes indistinguishable from sociality as such.},

Abstract = {For two decades, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Turkey
   sustained its electoral performance at the local level. We offer and
   test a new mechanism that contributed to the party's success in
   municipal elections. We argue that patronage links with religious civil
   society served as an important instrument of building and sustaining
   local incumbency advantage. Employing a close-election regression
   discontinuity design, we address two questions: To what extent did
   religious associations proliferate in AKP-controlled municipalities? Was
   this civil society penetration instrumental for the party's electoral
   success? Employing a close-election regression discontinuity design
   (RDD), we show that in districts with a small-margin AKP victory in the
   2014 elections, the number of religious associations in 2016 were
   significantly higher than in districts where AKP lost narrowly. We also
   find that the AKP incumbency in 2014 in closely contested districts
   increased the party's vote share in the next local elections. Our
   results empirically demonstrate a new channel of local incumbency
   advantage. Moreover, we highlight the role of civil society as an agent
   of clientelistic exchange in competitive authoritarian regimes.},

Title = {Impact of information shortcuts on preferential voting: Gender and
   ballot position effects in Luxembourg and Switzerland},
Journal = {SWISS POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {Free party lists provide voters with greater freedom of choice than
   other electoral systems, allowing them to select candidates within and
   between parties. Given that free party lists are cognitively highly
   demanding, voters have incentives to use shortcuts to discriminate
   between candidates. This study uses multilevel linear regression models
   to analyze the effect of candidates' gender and ballot position on
   preference voting in Luxembourg and Switzerland. Our results show that
   both candidates' gender and ballot position have a significant effect on
   their preference voting share and provide evidence on how they interact
   in intraparty competition. Candidates' ballot position has an inverse
   J-shaped effect on their preference vote share. This effect varies with
   candidates' gender in both countries but works in different directions.
   Our findings have important implications for electoral system design,
   outlining the potential consequences of alphabetical and party-ordered
   lists for candidates' chances and for electoral gender quotas'
   effectiveness under intraparty preference voting procedures.
   Freie Parteilisten bieten den W \& auml;hlern mehr Wahlfreiheit als
   andere Wahlsysteme, da sie ihnen erlauben, KandidatInnen innerhalb und
   zwischen Parteien auszuw \& auml;hlen. Da freie Parteilisten kognitiv
   sehr anspruchsvoll sind, haben W \& auml;hler Anreize, kognitive
   shortcuts zu verwenden, um zwischen KandidatInnen zu unterscheiden.
   Diese Studie analysiert die Auswirkungen von Geschlecht und
   Listenposition der KandidatInnen auf die Pr \& auml;ferenzwahl in
   Luxemburg und der Schweiz mithilfe mehrstufiger linearer
   Regressionsmodelle. Wir zeigen, dass Geschlecht und Listenposition den
   Anteil an der Pr \& auml;ferenzwahl signifikant beeinflussen und liefern
   Hinweise darauf, wie beide Variablen im innerparteilichen Wettbewerb
   interagieren. Die Listenposition der KandidatInnen hat einen umgekehrten
   J-f \& ouml;rmigen Effekt auf ihren Stimmenanteil. Dieser Effekt
   variiert in beiden L \& auml;ndern je nach Geschlecht der KandidatInnen,
   wirkt jedoch in unterschiedliche Richtungen. Unsere Ergebnisse wirken
   sich auf die Gestaltung von Wahlsystemen aus und zeigen potenzielle
   Folgen von alphabetischen und parteiorientierten Listen f \& uuml;r die
   Chancen der KandidatInnen und die Wirksamkeit von Geschlechterquoten bei
   parteiinternen Pr \& auml;ferenzwahlverfahren auf.
   Les listes de partis libres offrent aux \& eacute;lecteurs une plus
   grande libert \& eacute; de choix que les autres syst \& egrave;mes \&
   eacute;lectoraux, en leur permettant de s \& eacute;lectionner des
   candidats au sein d'un m \& ecirc;me parti ou entre plusieurs partis. \&
   Eacute;tant donn \& eacute; que les listes de partis libres sont
   cognitivement tr \& egrave;s exigeantes, les \& eacute;lecteurs sont
   incit \& eacute;s \& agrave; utiliser des raccourcis pour faire la
   distinction entre les candidats. Cette \& eacute;tude utilise des mod \&
   egrave;les de r \& eacute;gression lin \& eacute;aire multiniveaux pour
   analyser l'effet du sexe et de la position de liste des candidats sur le
   vote pr \& eacute;f \& eacute;rentiel au Luxembourg et en Suisse. Nos r
   \& eacute;sultats montrent que le sexe des candidats et leur position
   sur le bulletin de vote ont un effet significatif sur leur part de vote
   pr \& eacute;f \& eacute;rentiel et fournissent des preuves sur la fa \&
   ccedil;on dont ils interagissent dans la concurrence intra-parti. La
   position des candidats sur le bulletin de vote a un effet inverse en
   forme de J sur leur part de vote pr \& eacute;f \& eacute;rentiel. Cet
   effet varie en fonction du sexe des candidats dans les deux pays, mais
   dans des directions diff \& eacute;rentes. Nos r \& eacute;sultats ont
   des implications importantes pour la conception des syst \& egrave;mes
   \& eacute;lectoraux, soulignant les cons \& eacute;quences potentielles
   des listes alphab \& eacute;tiques et des listes ordonn \& eacute;es par
   les partis sur les chances des candidats et sur l'efficacit \& eacute;
   des quotas \& eacute;lectoraux par sexe dans le cadre des proc \&
   eacute;dures de vote pr \& eacute;f \& eacute;rentiel intra-parti.
   Le cosiddette ``liste libere{''} nelle elezioni offrono agli elettori
   una maggiore libert \& agrave; di scelta rispetto ad altri sistemi
   elettorali, consentendo loro di selezionare i candidati all'interno dei
   partiti e tra di essi. Poich \& eacute; le liste libere sono altamente
   impegnative dal punto di vista cognitivo, gli elettori sono incentivati
   a utilizzare gli shortcuts per discriminare tra i candidati. Questo
   studio utilizza modelli di regressione lineare multilivello per
   analizzare l'effetto del genere dei candidati e della posizione nella
   scheda elettorale sul voto di preferenza in Lussemburgo e in Svizzera. I
   risultati mostrano che sia il genere dei candidati che la loro posizione
   elettorale hanno un effetto significativo sulla loro quota di voti di
   preferenza e forniscono prove su come interagiscono nella competizione
   intrapartitica. La posizione elettorale dei candidati ha un effetto a
   forma di J inversa sulla quota di voti di preferenza. Questo effetto
   varia con il genere dei candidati in entrambi i Paesi, ma in direzioni
   diverse. I nostri risultati hanno importanti implicazioni per la
   progettazione dei sistemi elettorali, in quanto delineano le potenziali
   conseguenze delle liste alfabetiche e di quelle ordinate per partito
   sulle possibilit \& agrave; dei candidati e sull'efficacia delle quote
   elettorali di genere nelle procedure di voto di preferenza all'interno
   dei partiti.},

Title = {On the concept of the pluriverse in Walter Mignolo and the European New
   Right},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {469-489},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Today, the `pluriverse' is considered to be a radical new concept
   capable of decolonising political thought. However, it is not only
   decolonial scholarship that has taken up the concept of the pluriverse;
   far-right intellectuals, too, have been cultivating a decolonial
   imaginary based on the idea of the pluriverse. This article compares the
   way the concept of the pluriverse appears in certain strands of Latin
   American decolonial theory exemplified by Walter Mignolo, on the one
   hand, and the ethnopluralism of the European New Right represented by
   Alain de Benoist and Alexander Dugin, on the other. Despite Mignolo's
   pluriverse being an `open pluriverse' of entanglement between peoples,
   while the European New Right's is a `closed pluriverse' of ethnic
   separation, I argue that these uses of the pluriverse are nevertheless
   underpinned by a shared analytical and normative framework. This
   framework is defined by a simple refrain: that what oppresses the world
   is ontological and epistemological sameness, and what will liberate it
   is ontological and epistemological difference. I argue that this schema,
   which misapprehends imperialism as a form of epistemic domination geared
   purely towards homogenisation, rather than as a set of material
   relationships that also produce (e.g. racial, sexual, and class)
   difference, does not provide a solid foundation for contesting colonial
   relations.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the UK's law and practice of citizenship deprivation
   as a counterterrorism measure to deal with returning foreign terrorist
   fighters. What used to be an ``exceptional{''} measure has become
   increasingly institutionalised to give the executive broad powers even
   at the risk of making an individual stateless. The paper shows how the
   construction of the terrorist ``other{''} and the resulting politics of
   fear lead to a productive relationship between law and securitisation:
   the executive is using law as a tool to justify its decisions in the
   process of securitisation, and securitisation becomes the driver for
   legal changes that institutionalises the executive's power over its
   citizens. The paper uses the case of Shamima Begum and her attempts to
   return to argue that citizenship has become a securitised and racialised
   concept that is conditional on ill-defined criteria of what it means to
   be a ``good{''} British citizen. Citizenship has shifted from being a
   right to being a privilege, contingent on the Home Secretary's
   assessment of whether an individual adheres to ``British values{''}. The
   fact that this only affects those of foreign heritage, means that there
   are different classes of citizenship which raises important questions of
   fairness and equality.},

Title = {Deliberative mini-publics as learning schools for democracy? Examining
   deliberation impact on dissatisfied and radical participants of a
   citizens' assembly in Poland},

Abstract = {In a global context of democratic challenges such as dissatisfaction and
   social polarization, research on Western European democracies suggests
   that deliberative democracy instruments like deliberative mini-publics
   (DMPs) may provide a solution with their positive impact on
   participants' attitudes towards politics and democracy. Despite the
   proliferation of citizens' assemblies, especially locally, little is
   known about DMPs in newer democracies in Central and Eastern Europe, and
   it is uncertain whether the findings about the virtues of deliberation
   would hold. This study assesses the impact of a mini-public in Poland,
   focusing on the Citizens' Assembly on Energy Poverty, the country's
   first national-level deliberative initiative. Poland has faced
   heightened political dissatisfaction due to eight years of right-wing
   populist governance and the rise of radical ideologies, raising
   questions about deliberation's impact on dissatisfied and radical
   participants. Our results confirm the positive impact of deliberation on
   participants, improving their percepetion of knowledge, political
   interest, efficacy, and support for mini-publics. However, we find no
   significant differences of deliberation between dissatisfied, radical
   participants, and other groups highlighting the universal benefits of
   deliberation. These inconclusive findings may be due to a common
   recruitment bias in DMPs, specifically enrolling politically engaged
   citizens, thus limiting the potential for a learning curve.},

Abstract = {This study investigates factors influencing support for digital
   governance solutions and compares this support between autocracies and
   democracies. We conduct survey experiments in Russia, Germany, Turkey,
   the United States, and Estonia, and find that awareness of potential
   misuse of digital governance tools by the government reduces support.
   Importantly, while this effect has previously been documented for China,
   we find it irrespective of regime type for an autocracy, a hybrid regime
   and three democracies. Individuals relying on government-controlled
   information sources are more likely to endorse digital governance tools.
   Our study challenges prior findings by indicating that gaps in public
   service quality do not boost support. Instead, satisfaction with
   government services correlates with trust in the government's capacity
   to implement digital governance solutions.},

Abstract = {By appealing to public concern over environmental issues, Green parties
   have emerged to gain secure positions in several party systems. However,
   in Canada, we know very little about why people support the Green Party.
   This research note draws upon the Canadian Election Study (CES) to
   explore the ways in which demographic factors, personality traits and
   individual environmentalism impact vote choice. Theorizing Green Party
   support as a form of pro-environmental behaviour, we build a model that
   tests the impact of demographic factors and personality traits as
   mediated through environmental attitudes. It finds that, while
   pro-environmental policy attitudes are the strongest predictor of Green
   Party support, several demographic factors and personality
   traits-specifically conscientiousness, openness to experience,
   agreeableness and extraversion-have an effect.},

Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 8},
Abstract = {Across the world, political parties are incorporating social movement
   strategies and frames. In this study, we pivot from the dominant focus
   on party characteristics to analyze drivers of support for movement
   parties in six European countries. We report results from a choice-based
   conjoint survey experiment showing that contrary to previous research,
   movement party voters favor neither candidates who are institutional
   outsiders nor those who actively participate in protests. Candidate
   policy positions are the most important driver of the vote for movement
   parties. Movement party voters, additionally, prefer candidates who
   either display anti-elitist sentiments or who want to ensure the smooth
   running of the current political system. These insights invite renewed
   attention to movement parties as an electoral vehicle whose voters
   prioritize decisive policy change.},

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between public (i.e.
   government-led) and private (i.e. industry-led) forms of lobby
   regulation, by inquiring over the conditions that render a mix between
   these two regulatory forms more likely. Drawing on the governance of
   professions scholarship, it presents a theoretically informed comparison
   between two jurisdictions-the US (federal level) and the EU
   (supranational level)-where the public regulation of lobbying is built
   on different models, namely a command-and-control model based on legally
   binding rules in the US and a cooperative model based on incentives and
   rewards in the EU. Findings show that, although formal public-private
   regulatory mixes are not present in either jurisdiction, the EU
   regulators have hewn closer to this arrangement by coopting lobbyists'
   professional associations as semi-permanent but unofficial governance
   `allies'. This outcome is due to an amalgam of factors, chief among
   which is the severity of political scandals involving lobbyists, which
   affects policymakers' reputational incentives for framing the public
   regulation of lobbying as a punitive or cooperative intervention.
   Methodologically, the article uses a combination of documentary analysis
   and expert interviews with lobby practitioners and public regulators on
   both sides of the Atlantic.},

Abstract = {Between 1947 and 1949, Harry Truman had all the markings of an isolated
   president. He was unelected, faced a Congress controlled by opposition
   Republicans, and was opposed by major segments of his own party. Yet
   unlike other presidents in similar isolated positions, Truman managed to
   overcome these institutional obstacles and was successfully elected to
   his own term in office and pulled the Democrats into majorities in both
   houses of Congress. This article examines the conditions that allowed
   Truman to escape his political and institutional isolation, arguing not
   only that Truman gives us a clear view of the strong constitutional
   basis of presidential power in the modern era, but also that
   extraconstitutional developments enabled Truman to do what no other
   isolated president was able to accomplish.},

Abstract = {In the framework of his ontology of necessity, Spinoza understands
   contingency as a perspective linked to imagination, from which humans
   know the world. Contingency is then associated with a limited and
   partial way of knowing. Does this inevitably make it an obstacle? What
   is its power and its place within Spinoza's philosophy? In this paper,
   we aim to demonstrate that imagination -and specifically the perspective
   of contingency, understood as a way of inhabiting the world- provides,
   even in its inadequacy, a fundamental access to the knowledge of our
   identity and to the more immediate knowledge of the other beings with
   whom we necessarily coexist. This is directly related to the ethical
   task proposed by the Spinozist project and engages with the construction
   of freedom and happiness.},

Abstract = {Historical records confirm the peaceful coexistence of individuals from
   diverse religious and cultural backgrounds. This paper seeks to analyse
   the enduring conflict between Israel and Palestine as a case in point to
   illustrate how prolonged conflicts can transform religions into
   ideologies fuelling the quest for survival and justice, rendering
   political resolutions futile. Through a narrative review, it contends
   that decades of occupation, forced displacements, and expulsions from
   the sacred territories of various faiths have led to significant loss of
   life, economic stagnation, and global health crises, despite numerous
   United Nations efforts to broker peace. Emphasising the centrality of
   religion in this conflict, this narrative suggests avenues for future
   research and political deliberation.},

Abstract = {The 2020 US presidential election was won by Democrat challenger Joseph
   Biden over Republican incumbent Donald Trump and was contested during
   the global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Unemployment
   increased sharply during the pandemic but was followed by a large
   federal relief package. We investigate whether there was economic voting
   in the 2020 election, that is, whether the increased unemployment rate
   and the subsequent government response during the pandemic affected
   Trump's vote negatively or positively overall. We examine 48 states (by
   excluding Alaska, Hawaii, and DC). Using a triple-differences (DDD)
   model (that is, examining changes in a candidate's county-level
   vote-share depending on the change in unemployment and historical
   Republican-Democrat partisanship), we predict what would have happened
   if the increase in unemployment rate in between March and October 2020
   had been more modest. Although many states show significant negative
   expected impacts on the Trump vote, we predict that only when when the
   unemployment rates experience little change during the pandemic would
   overall results have swung in the incumbent's favour - and only then in
   Arizona and Georgia.},

Abstract = {The use of emotive rhetoric in legislative debates has attracted
   increasing scholarly attention in political science research. Building
   on recent scholarship, I examine the conditions under which emotive
   rhetoric dominates legislative speeches in the UK House of Commons
   between 2001 and 2015. By coding nearly half a million legislative
   speeches according to Ekman's six basic emotions - anger, disgust, fear,
   joy, sadness and surprise - I argue that members of parliament (MPs)
   strategically use emotions in their speeches to maximize their influence
   and visibility. The findings reveal modest but discernible effects
   related to electoral safety, seniority and party status. Specifically,
   the results show that speeches by electorally vulnerable, junior and
   opposition MPs contain higher levels of emotive language compared to
   those by other MPs. Notably, despite considerable similarity in the
   correlates of individual emotion categories, there are also significant
   differences. For example, opposition MPs and electorally vulnerable MPs
   rely more heavily on negative emotions such as anger, disgust, fear and
   sadness than government MPs and electorally safer MPs. While junior MPs
   use fear, sadness and surprise at higher rates compared to their senior
   counterparts, they are statistically indistinguishable from senior MPs
   in their use of anger, disgust and joy. Overall, these results
   underscore the need for greater scholarly attention to the communication
   styles of representatives in legislatures and emphasize the importance
   of examining the nuanced strategies behind the use of different types of
   emotions.},

Abstract = {Over the last three decades, the phenomenon of violent extremism,
   primarily religious and ethno-nationalist extremism, has emerged as one
   of the biggest security challenges for Pakistan. With continuous
   technological innovations and advancements, the nature of violent
   extremism is constantly evolving, and now more than ever, it is
   threatening Pakistan's social fabric, causing domestic disharmony and
   leading to unrest and terrorism. More importantly, it adversely affects
   the state's foreign relations. This study aims to comprehensively
   examine the complex interplay of factors contributing to violent
   extremism in Pakistan. By investigating both the root causes and the
   ensuing effects through the Securitization paradigm's lens, this
   research seeks to develop effective policy strategies to combat this
   growing threat. The securitization paradigm is crucial for understanding
   how extremist ideologies are constructed as existential threats, shaping
   societal responses and informing counter-extremism measures. The paper
   follows a mixed approach based on descriptive and critical analytical
   qualitative research methods.},

Abstract = {Generation Z is the most educated and yet pessimistic about the future.
   At the same time, populist parties have much support among young voters.
   Do they find an answer to their discouraging socio-economic situation in
   populist appeals? In this article, we analyse how pessimistic economic
   expectations shape the preference for populist parties among the young
   in Spain. By using conjoint experiments, we explore which specific
   features of populist parties ('thin' or `thick' characteristics) are
   decisive in attracting young and pessimistic voters. Unlike older
   generations, for whom immigration is the most relevant factor,
   Generation Z, especially the pessimistic, focuses more on the thin
   ideological elements of populism. This finding contradicts previous
   experimental studies, which argue that thin populist characteristics are
   irrelevant in explaining the general population's voting behaviour.
   Ideology plays a significant mediating role, as young pessimists on the
   left tend to be attracted by anti-elitism, while those on the
   centre-right by people-centrism.},

Abstract = {Contrary to recent developments within party politics, Roma political
   parties in Romania fail to incorporate digital technology into their
   activities, although they face a continuously decreasing level of
   support from their voters. To explain this phenomenon, this article
   argues that elections governed by non-programmatic strategies create not
   only different incentives towards digitalization, but also pose more
   challenges for certain ethnic parties, which also face internal
   shortcomings. It looks at the 2020 local elections in Romania and
   focuses on the two largest Roma political parties. The qualitative
   analysis, based on interviews with county Roma party leaders, confirms
   that the lack of digitalization is influenced by local clientelism,
   which affects the Roma electorate because of their socioeconomic
   situation. Besides, internal shortcomings further constrain such an
   option.
   Im Gegensatz zu den j \& uuml;ngsten Entwicklungen in der Parteipolitik
   integrieren Roma-Parteien in Rum \& auml;nien digitale Technologien
   nicht in ihre Aktivit \& auml;ten, obwohl sie von ihren W \& auml;hlern
   immer weniger Unterst \& uuml;tzung erhalten. Um dieses Ph \& auml;nomen
   zu erkl \& auml;ren, argumentiert dieser Artikel, dass Wahlen, die von
   nicht-programmatischen Strategien gesteuert werden, nicht nur andere
   Anreize zur Digitalisierung schaffen; sie stellen zudem bestimmte
   ethnische Parteien, die auch mit internen Defiziten konfrontiert sind,
   vor gr \& ouml;ss ere Herausforderungen. Der Artikel befasst sich mit
   den Kommunalwahlen 2020 in Rum \& auml;nien und konzentriert sich auf
   die beiden gr \& ouml;ss ten politischen Roma-Parteien. Die qualitative
   Analyse basiert auf Interviews mit Roma-Parteif \& uuml;hrern auf Ebene
   der Landkreise und best \& auml;tigt, dass der Mangel an Digitalisierung
   durch lokalen Klientelismus beeinflusst wird, der die Roma-W \&
   auml;hlerschaft aufgrund ihrer sozio \& ouml;konomischen Situation
   beeintr \& auml;chtigt. Dar \& uuml;ber hinaus schr \& auml;nken interne
   M \& auml;ngel eine solche Option zus \& auml;tzlich ein.

   Contrariamente ai recenti sviluppi all'interno della politica dei
   partiti, i partiti politici rom in Romania non riescono a incorporare la
   tecnologia digitale nelle loro attivit \& agrave;, sebbene debbano far
   fronte a un livello di sostegno in continua diminuzione da parte dei
   loro elettori. Per spiegare tale fenomeno, questo articolo sostiene che
   le elezioni gestite con strategie non programmatiche creano non solo
   diversi incentivi verso la digitalizzazione, ma pongono anche maggiori
   sfide per alcuni partiti etnici, che inoltre devono affrontare certe
   carenze interne. Lo studio analizza le elezioni locali del 2020 in
   Romania e si concentra sui due maggiori partiti politici rom. L'analisi
   qualitativa, basata su interviste con i leader dei partiti rom locali,

   clientelismo locale, che colpisce l'elettorato rom a causa della sua
   situazione socioeconomica. Inoltre, le carenze interne limitano
   ulteriormente l'uso di strumenti digitali.},

Title = {The ultimate political question? Realism and omnicide},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 16},
Abstract = {Realist political theory purports to prioritize the goals of order,
   security, and `political survival'. In spite of these concerns, it has
   not yet addressed the growing risk that humanity might be lurching
   towards self-extinction. This contribution considers what omnicidal risk
   means for contemporary realism, making two arguments. First, we argue
   that omnicidal risk poses a political problem in a distinctly realist
   sense of the term. In doing so, we demonstrate that omnicide is a
   relevant concern for all realists, while ordorealists in particular hold
   an unrecognized commitment to mitigating omnicidal risk. Second, by
   demonstrating the extent to which capitalism can be considered a cause
   of contemporary omnicidal risk, we argue that this concern and
   commitment should draw realists - and, in particular, ordorealists -
   into a critique of contemporary political economy. Realism should not
   ignore omnicidal risk; instead, its consideration should work to
   radicalize realism.},

Abstract = {While social class has received renewed attention as a driver of
   political conflict in Western democracies, little is known about when
   political differences by classes emerge and consolidate. Are they a
   direct consequence of individuals' economic prospects and daily
   experiences on the job, or are they driven by a sorting process
   responding to family origin and earlier formative experiences? This
   study applies a life course approach to identify the impact of (future)
   social classes during early adulthood, in the transition to employment,
   and the transition to the main class of destination. These longitudinal
   analyses using British and Swiss panel data allow for adjudicating the
   stage(s) at which political preferences become more marked across social
   classes. The results indicate that differences by (future) class are
   apparent early in life, and that they consolidate during employment.
   This research advances current and historical debates about social class
   as a relevant milieu of political socialisation and public opinion
   formation.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of civic action on enhancing
   accountability and combating corruption in political financing, focusing
   on two civil society initiatives in Uruguay. The initiatives aimed to
   digitize and map information on funding received by political parties
   and politicians in the 2009 and 2014 elections, presenting their
   findings through interactive online platforms. The paper engages
   theoretically with the literature on the dimensions of accountability
   and contributes to understanding the challenges faced by civil society
   organizations in promoting political financing accountability even in
   full democracies, a topic largely understudied. Findings highlight
   concerns beyond electoral authorities' well-known resource constraints
   in detecting illicit political donations and spending in Uruguay. The
   paper shows that transparency is not enough to reduce corruption. We
   argue that for political finance accountability to be effective, it must
   encompass bottom-up, horizontal, and diagonal dimensions. The analysis
   suggests the need for complementary measures, such as digital solutions
   for reporting and disclosing political finance information, along with
   active horizontal and bottom-up oversight mechanisms. The article draws
   on qualitative analysis based on documentary research and 19 interviews
   with activists, academics, journalists, developers of the initiatives,
   and public officials involved in political finance regulation.},

Title = {Strategic state violence and migration in conflict},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 9},
Abstract = {Governments routinely wage civil conflicts in ways that disrupt
   civilians' lives and livelihoods, creating harmful externalities like
   internal displacement. Both fighting and displacement hinder economic
   activity, jeopardizing popular support for governments and reducing the
   future gains of governance. How do states fight when using force induces
   migration and thus risks popular discontent? I model a conflict where
   government efforts to control territory spur displacement, creating
   economic disruption that can spark tension between displaced civilians
   and government supporters. The risk of losing popular support leads the
   government to modify its tactics. While the government could mitigate
   the disruptive consequences of displacement by fighting less, I find
   another, more troubling, strategy. Governments may engage in preemptive
   violence to prevent migration. Moreover, economic downturns exacerbate
   migration incentives and, I find, can also increase violence against
   civilians. Governments anticipating displacement fight more intense
   conflicts today to see relatively less migration in the future.},

Abstract = {Merged municipalities create unequal opportunities for sub-municipal
   units according to their relative size and administrative centrality.
   Because electoral manifestos provide the basis for policy-making on
   services, we analyse how the mentions of different sub-municipal units
   are distributed in manifestos. We analyze the manifestos of 381 parties
   in 82 amalgamated municipalities in the 2022 local elections in Czechia,
   focussing on the effects of size, administrative centrality, and
   presence of candidates from the units on candidate lists. The
   probability of mentioning a unit is affected by the presence of
   candidates from the unit on candidate lists, and that the probability of
   mentioning is very low for small and peripheral units without
   candidates. The results show the systematic differences in attention
   parties pay to various sub-municipal units and crucial importance of
   unit-based candidates for the substantive representation within the
   amalgamated municipalities.
   Fusionierte Gemeinden schaffen ungleiche Chancen f \& uuml;r
   subkommunale Einheiten je nach deren relativen Gr \& ouml;ss e und
   administrativen Zentralit \& auml;t. Da politische Entscheidungen \&
   uuml;ber kommunale Dienstleistungen aus Parteiprogrammen hervorgehen,
   analysieren wir, wie h \& auml;ufig verschiedene subkommunale Einheiten
   hierin erw \& auml;hnt werden. Die Analyse umfasst die Wahlprogramme von
   381 Parteien in 82 zusammengelegten Gemeinden bei den tschechischen
   Kommunalwahlen 2022. Dabei analysieren wir die Variablen Gr \& ouml;ss
   e, administrative Zentralit \& auml;t und Pr \& auml;senz auf den
   Kandidatenlisten von KandidatInnen aus diesen Einheiten. Die
   Wahrscheinlichkeit der Erw \& auml;hnung einer Einheit wird durch das
   Vorhandensein von KandidatInnen aus der Einheit auf den Kandidatenlisten
   beeinflusst. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit der Erw \& auml;hnung ist f \&
   uuml;r kleine und periphere Einheiten ohne KandidatInnen sehr gering.
   Die Ergebnisse zeigen systematische Unterschiede in der Aufmerksamkeit,
   die die Parteien den verschiedenen innergemeindlichen Einheiten

   Le fusioni di comuni creano opportunit \& agrave; diseguali per le unit
   \& agrave; sub-comunali, a dipendenza delle loro dimensioni e della loro
   centralit \& agrave; amministrativa. Poich \& eacute; i manifesti
   elettorali costituiscono la base per la definizione delle politiche sui
   servizi, ci concentriamo sul modo in cui le menzioni delle diverse unit
   \& agrave; sub-comunali sono distribuite nei manifesti. Analizziamo i
   manifesti di 381 partiti in 82 comuni accorpati alle elezioni
   amministrative del 2022 nella Repubblica ceca, concentrandoci sugli
   effetti delle dimensioni, della centralit \& agrave; amministrativa e
   della presenza di candidati delle unit \& agrave; sub-comunali nelle
   liste elettorali. Troviamo che la probabilit \& agrave; di menzionare
   un'unit \& agrave; \& egrave; influenzata dalla presenza di candidati di
   tale unit \& agrave; nelle liste elettorali. Inoltre, la probabilit \&
   agrave; di menzione \& egrave; molto bassa per le unit \& agrave;
   piccole e periferiche senza candidati. I risultati mostrano le
   differenze sistematiche nell'attenzione che i partiti prestano alle
   varie unit \& agrave; sub-comunali e l'importanza cruciale dei candidati
   di tali unit \& agrave; per la rappresentanza sostanziale all'interno

Abstract = {We provide the first large-scale, global evidence on the impact of the
   skill composition of trade on political approval. We show that political
   implications of trade shocks depend on the relationship between workers'
   skills and the characteristics of goods traded. Using Gallup World Poll
   surveys of a million respondents from 121 countries over 2005-18, we
   show that growth in high-skill intensive exports increases confidence in
   government among skilled individuals relative to unskilled ones. Growth
   in high-skill intensive imports has the opposite effect. Growth in
   low-skill intensive exports (imports) increases (decreases) confidence
   in government among unskilled individuals relative to skilled ones. To
   identify causal relationships, we construct instruments based on
   time-varying effects of air and sea distances on bilateral trade in
   goods of different skill intensity.},

Abstract = {This article explores how the meaning of citizenship is articulated and
   debated in the aftermath of the legal prohibition of the slaughter of
   cow progeny and making the sale or possession of beef a punishable
   offense in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. The prohibition
   illuminated contradictions between the cultural roots of nationalism as
   opposed to democratic citizenship and how the two are increasingly in
   friction with the rising popularity of the Hindu right. Public action
   and debate in the aftermath of the beef ban (as it came to be popularly
   known) bestowed multiple conceptions of citizenship in the light of
   profound social divisions providing for the space to seek political
   solidarity with other marginalized groups. Here, I suggest that paying
   attention to the subtler nuances of political action through a framework
   of solidarity as opposed to that of resistance can bring to light ways
   in which citizenship is debated and shaped in urban India.},

Abstract = {A central puzzle of international relations research is understanding
   how groups of cooperative states form. While in theory cooperative
   groups of states can be made up of states with diverse domestic
   organizations, in practice, groups of cooperative states tend to have
   similar domestic characteristics. In this regard, the current state of
   knowledge on international cooperation is lacking. I fill this research
   gap by analyzing how network relations simultaneously affect the
   domestic organization of and conflict among states. Specifically, I
   argue that frequent interactions and dynamic network formation help
   states signal their preferences, interests, and capabilities. This
   information helps spread the political institutions of more powerful
   states, while alleviating information and coordination problems within
   groups of states. Over time, this creates cooperative communities or
   politically homophilous groups of states that are more internally
   cooperative. When these processes are jointly considered, shared
   institutional characteristics have a null effect on interstate conflict.},

Abstract = {The 2024 French legislative elections were called by President Macron
   following the severe defeat of his coalition in the 2024 European
   elections. Held on 30 June and 7 July after a 3-week campaign, these
   snap elections were part of an unexpected electoral sequence. The first
   round confirmed the rise of the radical right Rassemblement National in
   the European contest: for the first time in the first round of
   legislative elections, a radical right coalition was the largest
   pre-election coalition by vote. However, the second round reaffirmed the
   radical right was still rejected by the majority of French people,
   finishing third in terms of seats, behind both the left-wing coalition
   and the presidential coalition. A centre-right minority government was
   ultimately formed with four parties (Les R \& eacute;publicains,
   Renaissance, Mouvement D \& eacute;mocrate and Horizons) and the
   parliamentary tolerance of the Rassemblement national. From the
   realignment perspective, the legislative elections were maintaining
   elections, confirming the tripartition of the votes, the tripolarisation
   of party competition and the end of majority governments - three key
   features of the new electoral order that emerged after the 2019 European
   elections.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Collective security by regional organisations continues to be impacted
   by evolving global security threats. Previously focused at the global
   level, the shift from interstate conflicts to intra-state conflicts
   resulted in the acknowledgement of regionalism and the functions of
   collective security being implemented at the regional level. This paper
   examines the development of regionalism in the security sphere and the
   evolving relationship between the United Nations (UN) and regional
   organisations. Employing historical and comparative perspectives, it
   considers both the development of regional security projects and the
   reasons for their successes and failures. It also critically analyses
   the various constitutional developments that have occurred within
   regional arrangements looking particularly at the African Union (AU) and
   what accounts for such regional organisations to depart from the
   normative framework of regional arrangements contained in Chapter VIII
   of the UN Charter. The paper uses primary and secondary material to
   understand the compatibility of Chapter VIII of the UN Charter and the
   Constitutive Act of the AU as mechanisms used to respond to peace and
   security challenges on the African continent. The design of the study is
   qualitative research and the AU is used as a case study from other
   regional organisations. The theoretical framework adopted, based on its
   explanatory power, is collective security.},

Abstract = {In the 19th century, the first capital markets opened up. At that time,
   there was a literary genre with the Stock Exchange as its subject.
   Writers described the Stock Exchange as a place where people gambled as
   in the casino, a place that did not create wealth, a place where crooks
   got rich on the backs of na \& iuml;ve small savers. Following the
   serious crisis of 1929, the Stock Exchange loses its importance in the
   economy. From the 1980s, finance tries to reaffirm its hold on the
   future of our world. Stock Exchange films were appearing the heirs to
   the Stock Exchange novel. The films bring out the moral issues
   surrounding the world of finance. This article will analyze Martin
   Scorsese's film The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) built on the
   autobiography of a real character who was a major stock market player.
   During the 1980s, the stock market was a playground for individuals with
   working-class backgrounds who enriched themselves using methods of thugs
   imported from the school of hard knocks. Many have ended up in prison
   because of their inability to leave the world of finance in time and
   because they became gambling addicts in the meantime.},

Abstract = {The scientific literature on politicians has predominantly focused on
   political professionalism. Scholars have defined the profile of the
   professional politician - characterized by a long political career
   involving roles in local, national and European institutions - and of
   the successful outsider - who enters politics thanks to external
   resources. However, there has been little attention to individuals, with
   contrasting profiles, who stand for election without prior institutional
   experience. Our research addresses this gap in the literature by
   examining candidates without electoral experience - referred to as
   amateurs - in the 2022 Italian general election. Through analysis of the
   CVs they submitted at the time of their nomination as candidates, the
   study explores their profiles and proposes a classification based on
   their previous positions in associations and political parties. The
   study highlights the different distributions of these two variables and
   illustrates the different selection strategies pursued by political
   parties. Moreover, the research confirms the significance of a
   classification system, demonstrating that different types of amateur
   candidates, with varying backgrounds, tend to be placed in different
   positions on party lists and in the district and have different chances
   of being elected.},

Abstract = {Former UK intelligence chiefs Alex Younger and Jeremy Fleming recently
   suggested that the country's three intelligence collection agencies
   should be seen as a capability, questioning whether they should even
   still be separate. Celia Parker-Vincent and Michael Goodman explain what
   might be lost in blurring or removing their distinct identities and
   suggest that finding a way to enable the closest possible working
   between the agencies is the key to facing today's threats and ever-more
   complex operating environment. The UK should look to its Five Eyes
   partners, specifically the US and Australia, for inspiration. With one
   of the pre-eminent intelligence apparatuses in the world, the new UK
   government should make sure there is no risk to the country losing its
   strong position.},

Abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated the importance of racial resentment
   and sexism in voting in the 2016 election. While this could be primarily
   a function of the particular electoral context, this study takes a
   broader look at a potential link between racist and sexist attitudes. At
   least since the election of Barack Obama, racial resentment has been
   found to increasingly correlate with a range of political views. But, we
   do not yet know whether this connection applies to gendered attitudes as
   well. Using American National Election Studies (ANES) data spanning five
   presidential election cycles (2004-2020), we explore whether racial and
   gendered views are correlated. Specifically, we examine the connection
   between racial resentment and three distinct gendered attitudes,
   including traditional gender roles, modern sexism, and beliefs about
   gender discrimination. We test two possibilities: whether a link between
   these views emerges as the result of racial priming by elites,
   consistent with ``racial spillover,{''} or if racist and sexist
   attitudes are connected as part of the same underlying,
   system-justifying framework, meaning that this relationship endures over
   time, predating Obama's 2008 election. We find strong evidence that,
   throughout the period under study, racial resentment is associated with
   all three gendered attitudes and appears to be part of a more
   comprehensive worldview rather than simply a ``spillover{''} effect. Our
   analysis suggests that scholars should do more to examine the underlying
   attitudinal factors that influence both racism and sexism, as well as
   the enduring nature of this relationship over time.},

Title = {Redistribution vs. Recognition: How Brexit Split the Left},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICS CULTURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 13},
Abstract = {Brexit is typically seen as a canonical example of right-wing populism,
   yet a third of those who voted for left-of-centre parties at the 2015 UK
   General Election also supported Brexit one year later. This bloc of 5
   million people was around four times the size of the Leave campaign's
   margin of victory. This article constructs the first discursive analysis
   of leftist Brexit support. Drawing on qualitative interviews with
   twenty-three left-identifying residents of the `Red Wall' region of
   England, I examine continuities between leftist identities and
   pro-Brexit discourse. Participants consistently constructed their
   political identities from ideas that broadly corresponded to Fraser's
   folk paradigms of social justice `redistribution' and `recognition'.
   Relations between the paradigms were more complex-and more
   antagonistic-in participant accounts than Fraser's `distinct but
   equivalent' ideal. Three discursive logics promoted leftist Brexit
   support by (i) counterposing redistribution of wealth against the
   `neoliberal' European Union, while associating Brexit itself with
   notions of (ii) `underdog spirit' and (iii) `unity'. Each logic shared
   affinities with the redistribution paradigm, and were often expressed
   alongside antagonism toward recognition. I conclude that Brexit split
   the left by exploiting pre-existing tensions between the left's
   constituent parts. Leftist Brexit support was thus a partial
   epiphenomenon of the contemporary left's dual form. A shift away from

Abstract = {We develop a theory of policy advice that focuses on the relationship
   between the competence of the advisor (e.g., an expert bureaucracy) and
   the quality of advice that the leader may expect. We describe important
   tensions between these features present in a wide class of substantively
   important circumstances. These tensions point to the presence of a
   trade-off between receiving advice more often and receiving more
   informative advice. The optimal realization of this trade-off for the
   leader sometimes induces her to prefer advisors of limited competence-a
   preference that, we show, is robust under different informational
   assumptions. We consider how institutional tools available to leaders
   affect preferences for advisor competence and the quality of advice they
   may expect to receive in equilibrium.},

Abstract = {Unlike many, or most, Western leaders, David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first
   prime minister and primary founder, had become interested in Asia, and
   especially India and later even more in China, since the 1930s. He
   predicted the disintegration of colonialism, the liberation of Asian
   countries, and the emergence of China not only as one of the world's
   great powers, but as the greatest. From the very beginning, he
   criticized Washington's support of the Kuomintang's corrupted regime
   and, following the establishment of the People's Republic of China,
   blocking its admission to the United Nations as a colossal foreign
   policy mistake. In a number of papers, speeches, interviews, and
   conversations, Ben-Gurion expected President Kennedy to correct this
   mistake and regarded U.S. involvement in Vietnam as another mistake.
   Long before his death in December 1973, he had warned of the gradual and
   relative weakening of the United States in contrast to the eventual rise
   of China in military, economic, and technological terms. He also
   underlined that Moscow, rather than Beijing, is Washington's main enemy
   and that the essence of the conflict between China and the Soviet Union
   is not ideological but primarily territorial, related to lands occupied
   by Russia since the 17th century, which China would never forget nor
   forgive. Along with his other prophecies (Israel's peace with Egypt,
   European unity, and the Soviet collapse), his conclusion that Washington
   would have no choice but to resume its partnership with China soon
   materialized.},

Abstract = {What is the relationship between policy positions taken in campaigns and
   those proposed in bargaining when the final policy outcome depends on
   other political actors? Why do candidates sometimes advocate policies in
   their campaigns that are unlikely or impossible to pass given the
   preferences of other actors in the government? We analyze a model in
   which candidates make non-binding policy platform announcements and then
   bargain with a Veto player over the final policy if they take office. In
   the model, a candidate has private information that is related to the
   policy preferences of a key citizen group and engages in bargaining with
   a Veto player who is responsive to this information. When the citizen's
   group sometimes interprets campaign promises naively, elections are more
   likely to allow information revelation. Furthermore, in this case,
   politicians overpromise: the politician's platform is outside of the
   range of feasible bargaining outcomes.},

Title = {Is there a rural-urban political divide in Britain?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 27},
Abstract = {A rural-urban political divide, characterized by rural mistrust in
   politics, dissatisfaction with democracy, and support for
   authoritarian-populist leaders and parties, has been identified in many
   Western democracies. Yet there has been little investigation of the
   extent to which British public opinion is divided in this fashion. Using
   British Election Study data from 2016 and 2019 that combines large
   samples with finely-grained geographic identifiers, this paper
   investigates the possible presence and extent of a rural-urban divide in
   British political attitudes and values. We find that while rural Britons
   are more conservative on economic issues, and more supportive of the
   Conservative party than urbanites, the two groups have comparable levels
   of democratic satisfaction, political trust, and authoritarianism. As
   such, unlike in other Western democracies, we do not find any evidence
   that rural Britons are more resentful, dissatisfied, or
   ``left-behind{''} compared to their urban counterparts.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the impact of everyday corruption in North Korea on
   perceptions of authoritarian leadership. Analyzing survey data from
   North Korean defectors, we find that experience with everyday corruption
   does not affect perceptions of the Supreme Leader's responsibility for
   economic difficulties, but it does negatively affect perceptions of the
   Party leadership's responsibility. This suggests that widespread petty
   corruption is unlikely to be a source of dissatisfaction with the system
   as a whole and with the Supreme Leader.},

   The case of SOLVIT},
Journal = {EUROPEAN UNION POLITICS},

Volume = {25},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article provides an analysis of the temporal development of
   interactions within SOLVIT, the European Union's problem-solving
   internal market network. Adopting an agency-based, rationalist approach,
   we hypothesize that temporal development depends on cross-border
   interdependence, institutional homogeneity, SOLVIT centre caseload and
   Brexit. Testing these hypotheses, we control for members' resources,
   perceptions of SOLVIT and endogenous network dynamics. The ensuing model
   is tested using stochastic actor-oriented models on interactions in 2011
   and 2018, thus yielding a panel-data analysis. Our main finding is that
   SOLVIT interactions are remarkably stable over time. This is mostly due
   to the strong effect of interdependence, which is rather constant over
   time. Strikingly, we find no effect for institutional homogeneity, case
   load and Brexit. In sum, our analysis reveals that European
   Administrative Networks can develop into stable patterns of
   interactions, driven by rather structural features of interdependence.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 22},
Abstract = {This paper explores if people should be able to enjoy a freedom to roam,
   understood as the right of every person to stay on landowners'
   properties, regardless of the will of the landowners. I make two
   interest-based arguments that tell against more exclusionary and in
   favour of less exclusionary property rights regimes with regard to land.
   The first, anti-proprietarian, argument, proposes that some, highly
   exclusionary proprietary preferences are problematic from a standpoint
   of public lawmaking, and that we ought to design laws and background
   institutions such that citizens will adopt less rather than more
   proprietarian attitudes. The second, amplification, argument, proposes
   that the freedom to roam serves an important interest in providing
   access to diverse and unique aspects of nature. These two arguments,
   taken together, tell against highly proprietary property rights
   arrangements with regards to land and in favour of less proprietary
   institutional arrangements. I also tackle two objections that purport
   that general exclusion rights to property in land are necessary for two
   key interests: (a) our capacity for ends-setting and (b) the
   preconditions of self-authorship, and that we should therefore not
   institute a right to roam. Both, I argue, fail.},

Abstract = {The Spanish regional public debt-to-GDP ratio is the highest in Europe.
   In this article, we study the evolution of the factors explaining the
   recent changes in this ratio from 2015 to 2023. Moreover, we estimate
   the fiscal consolidation efforts needed to achieve a determined level of
   public debt. Likewise, a macroeconomic model is calibrated to simulate
   the future evolution of regional public debt under different
   consolidation strategies. Our main conclusion shows that the most
   indebted regions should address a significant (and likely unfeasible)
   deleveraging process over the next years in the context of the new
   European fiscal rules.},

Abstract = {The 2022 midterm elections resulted in a record-breaking number of women
   being elected to the U.S. Congress. Previous research suggests that men
   and women adopt very different styles when campaigning for Congress on
   Twitter. Women tend to focus more on issues and especially women's
   issues compared to men. This research examines gender dynamics during
   the 2022 midterm elections to uncover gender differences in
   congressional campaign communication. We find that while both gender and
   party play a role in the attention congressional candidates give to
   ``women's issues,{''} partisanship has a stronger role in shaping
   candidates' attention to ``men's issues.{''} Democratic men and women
   focus significantly more on women's issues compared to Republican men.
   Republican women focused more on women's issues in the House but not the
   Senate races. Meanwhile, both Democratic women and men focused less
   attention on men's issues; however, the differences between Republican
   men and women were insignificant. This research helps shed light on the
   role of gender and party in congressional campaign communication on
   Twitter at a highly polarized time in American politics.},

Abstract = {Satisfaction with democracy is a widely studied measure of political
   support that is key for democratic stability. In this article, I explore
   its relationship with party system closure, that is the extent to which
   inter-party relations in the governmental area are stable and
   predictable. I argue that this relationship captures a trade-off between
   two key democratic outputs: representation and accountability. Analysing
   a dataset of 755 observations from 26 European countries throughout the
   period 1973-2019, I show that this trade-off manifests in an
   `inverted-U' shaped relationship between party system closure and
   satisfaction with democracy. This result implies an optimal level of
   party system closure which reconciles the tension between the two in a
   way that maximises satisfaction with democracy.},

Abstract = {Opposition is a core component of any democracy, yet it is scarcely
   studied. Leaning on research prescribing blurred lines between
   government and opposition in parliamentary democracies, we use word
   embeddings in tandem with sentiment analysis on written parliamentary
   questions in the Norwegian parliament to study conflict patterns between
   the government and opposition. Our findings consistently show that MPs
   of governing parties are more negative than MPs of the opposition.
   However, the effect is reduced considerably when the topical content of
   the question is included in the analysis. We attribute our finding to
   the existence of a participation threshold in parliamentary questions;
   MPs of governing parties will only ask questions whenever a given issue
   is sufficiently contentious.},

Journal = {SCOTTISH AFFAIRS},

Volume = {33},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Discussion of how the UK can remain coherent as a multinational state
   needs to focus not on what powers might be given away to the regions and
   nations but on how to facilitate a sharing of power between different
   parts of the UK. This article examines how far programmes for
   constitutional reform, including the Welsh Senedd's document Reforming
   our Union and the Labour Party's A New Britain, have recognised the need
   for power-sharing in their discussion of matters like the reform of the
   House of Lords and the role of the Supreme Court. The conclusion is that
   current views of the sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament are
   incompatible with any meaningful constitutional reform. To change this
   would require a willingness to have constitutional arrangements much
   closer to those of the European Union, the very organisation which the
   UK decided in 2016 that it wanted to leave. It would also require seeing
   Northern Ireland less as a `troublesome province' which needs to have
   its own form of government, but as an example of how progress can be
   made through power-sharing.},

Abstract = {Democracy in Indonesia should be a place to channel the aspirations of
   the people according to their preferences. The identity politics is a
   strategy carried out by interested groups in a contestation, the goal is
   to gain sympathy and votes in the election. However, the impact of the
   the identity politics tends to be negative where people tend to be
   selfish for one and group's sake and this is contrary to Pancasila and
   the 1945 Constitution. Bolaang Mongondow Regency is the locus of this
   research, where this area is still thick with the phenomenon of identity
   politics. This research examines the phenomenon of the the identity
   politics for election participants and also its impact on society as
   well as data found in the field and also previous studies that have
   examined matters related to the title of this research and then
   conducted a focus of group discussions. From the results of the study,
   it was found that the Identity Political in 2017 is still within the
   level of reasonableness and is one of the political strategies of the
   candidate pairs but is still within reasonable limits and it can be seen
   that there is no longer a majority force that has a sectoral ego in the
   interests of power but also the community has matured in choosing their
   leaders in the elections.},

Abstract = {Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been substantial
   scholarly interest in the roles of women in leadership positions. This
   multiple-case study explores the experiences of female political leaders
   during the pandemic, focusing on their roles, challenges, and
   resilience. The study encompasses ten women political leaders actively
   involved in pandemic-related activities in Dumingag, Zamboanga del Sur,
   Philippines. The findings indicate that these women embodied exceptional
   compassion and courage in their efforts to curb the virus's spread
   within their communities. The research underscores that the attributes
   traditionally associated with femininity, such as empathy and nurturing,
   were beneficial during the pandemic. Rather than posing a challenge,
   femininity complemented their leadership roles, with the main obstacles
   being the risk of contracting COVID-19 and public skepticism regarding
   the pandemic's seriousness. The study highlights that these female
   leaders adeptly managed the pandemic's challenges through effective
   cooperation and collaboration with stakeholders, underpinned by a
   commitment to altruism. This research contributes to the field by
   demonstrating that the qualities associated with female leadership can
   enhance crisis management. It informs the international debate on gender
   and leadership, suggesting that women's distinctive attributes may be
   particularly advantageous in navigating global health emergencies. By
   emphasizing these contributions, the study advocates for a broader
   recognition of the value of female leadership in crisis situations and
   encourages further examination of gender dynamics in leadership roles
   globally.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the impact of the Armenian-Azeri conflict on
   regional insecurity and a strategic partnership between Turkey and
   Russia in the South Caucasus. Like the Ottoman and Russian Empires of
   old, Russia and Turkey continued to have conflicting interests in the
   region after the end of the Cold War. However, the Russian invasion of
   Ukraine in 2022 turned this confrontation into a partnership between
   Moscow and Ankara, as both Russia and Turkey exploited opportunities to
   expand their control and influence in the region. Lilia Arakelyan and
   Hanna Kassab argue that Russia and Turkey's prestige-seeking behaviour
   is based on reciprocated recognition of greatness through cooperation
   and mutual support.},

Abstract = {Measurement is the weak link between theory and empirical test. Complex
   concepts such as ideology, identity, and legitimacy are difficult to
   measure; yet, without measurement that matches theoretical constructs,
   careful empirical studies may not be testing that which they had
   intended. Item response theory (IRT) models offer promise by producing
   transparent and improvable measures of latent factors thought to
   underlie behavior. Unfortunately, those factors have no intrinsic
   substantive interpretations. Prior solutions to the substantive
   interpretation problem require exogenous information about the units,
   such as legislators or survey respondents, which make up the data; limit
   analysis to one latent factor; and/or are difficult to generalize. We
   propose and validate a solution, IRT-M, that produces multiple,
   potentially correlated, generalizable, latent dimensions, each with
   substantive meaning that the analyst specifies before analysis to match
   theoretical concepts. We offer an R package and step-by-step
   instructions in its use, via an application to survey data.},

Abstract = {The commemorations of the 80(th) anniversary of D-Day serve to remind us
   what an extraordinary operation it was, not only in its planning and
   execution but also in the good luck which accompanied it. Such
   conditions are not easily reproducible, certainly not at scale. The
   technologies of modern anti-access/area denial operations make an
   amphibious operation of the size of Operation Overlord, particularly if
   launched over much greater distances than those of the English Channel,
   unlikely to succeed, argues Hew Strachan. Contemporary amphibious
   warfare and its related doctrine are therefore focused on raiding, not
   amphibious assault.},

Title = {The necropolitics of drone bases and use in the African context},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {139-161},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This paper critically evaluates the establishment of drone bases and the
   use of drones in several African countries and territories. Despite the
   significant financial commitments needed, external forces continue to
   invest heavily in drone bases and operations across the continent, often
   promoted for the security of the countries in Africa. Using secondary
   sources, this paper employs the concept of ``necropolitics{''} to argue
   that these drone bases, along with the technologies emanating from them
   - ostensibly for counter-insurgencies or counter-piracy - represent the
   deployment of ``aerial technologies of domination{''}. It posits that
   such technologies enable external forces to control the airspaces of
   several African countries and determine who lives and dies, thereby
   ensuring their acquiescence and subjugation under aerial colonialism.
   This paper challenges the prevailing discourse that drone operations
   primarily serve the interests of those under its surveillance and
   advocates for the establishment of pan-African security partnerships to
   guide against aerial colonialism across the countries of Africa.},

Abstract = {The case of the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar has increasingly come to
   illustrate the maximum evil of Facebook and its parent company, Meta.
   Yet most analyses of this case share a distinctive feature that
   radically narrows the scope of the problem: the focus is only on content
   that negatively characterizes the Rohingya, whether through hate speech,
   misinformation, or other efforts to construct them in ways that may be
   used to justify genocide. Such content is an important matter of
   concern. It warrants action, independent of causal effect. But the
   question of what conduct and content on Facebook may help cause violence
   must include analysis of a broader potential range that extends beyond
   characterizations of the victims. To specify some of this range, the
   article turns to scholarship from the field of genocide studies. In
   particular, it looks to the process of ``in-group policing,{''} which
   involves constructing not just victims of genocide but also those who
   are supposed to support it. The bulk of the article then analyzes
   in-group policing in Myanmar and on Facebook, by offering new
   interpretations of publicly available evidence and drawing on
   observations from work in Myanmar during the five years before
   large-scale military attacks on the Rohingya in 2016-17. The article
   concludes by discussing the implications of its findings for ongoing
   efforts to pursue restitution and accountability for the Rohingya
   genocide, and proposing concrete questions with broad relevance for
   scholars and practitioners.},

Abstract = {Focusing on the implementation of social policies in S \& atilde;o Paulo
   (Brazil) during the 2000s, this article critically examines the
   commodification of poverty. The article explores the impact of the
   introduction of market logics and privatization as shaped in respect to
   social protection in a context where the informalization of labour is
   growing. The text begins with a discussion of social citizenship in
   Brazil and its transformation over time. Thereafter, the article unpacks
   the `commodification processes' of social policies during the 2000s to
   unfold how this influences the organization of a competitive and social
   labour market outsourced especially to NGOs and associations. The
   creation of indicators of productivity and `social participation' as
   well as the introduction of measures to incentivize entrepreneurship,
   the article suggests, become entries into accessing social rights. The
   ways in which social workers and beneficiaries experience processes of
   financialization and monetarization of social aid, the article shows,
   indicate changing understandings of social citizenship and its
   implications for the poor.},

Abstract = {How do political parties share power internally? We study the internal
   organization of political parties as the solution of a moral hazard
   problem between a party conference and its factions. Factions'
   mobilization efforts benefit the party electorally, but can only be
   imperfectly monitored. In contrast with the logic of Michel's Iron Law,
   we provide a functionalist rationale for intraparty power sharing: We
   show that internal power sharing can enhance a party's electoral
   performance. This effect is stronger in settings that award more
   resources to election winners: Low interparty power sharing produces
   high intraparty power sharing. We also show that intraparty power
   sharing should be more frequent within smaller parties, when monitoring
   of factional effort is more precise (e.g., preferential voting systems),
   and when factions' ideological disagreements span multiple dimensions.},

Abstract = {Gender disparities in political attitudes and behavior are widely
   documented. However, when it comes to immigration policy, there is a
   lack of consensus in existing research: some studies indicate that women
   are more opposed to accommodating immigrants than men, while others
   suggest the contrary or find no significant gender difference. In an
   effort to shed light on these conflicting findings, this paper focuses
   on gendered differences in how individuals perceive and cultivate
   concerns about immigrants. We argue that gender plays a crucial role in
   how misconceptions about immigrants activate concerns about immigrants.
   To test our hypotheses, we conducted a pre-registered survey experiment
   in the Netherlands, in which we randomly varied participants'
   perceptions of the characteristics of the immigrant population. Our
   results offer suggestive evidence consistent with previous findings:
   altering immigrant perceptions did not significantly impact immigration
   policy preferences of either gender. However, perceiving immigrants as
   more in need did affect individuals' concerns about immigrants: we found
   that revised perceptions led men, but not women, to feel less morally
   obligated to accommodate immigrants.},

Abstract = {In his book A Great and Noble Scheme (2005), historian John Mack
   Faragher explains that the 1755-63 Acadian deportation can be termed
   ``ethnic cleansing,{''} following contemporary United Nations and
   scholarly usage of the expression. In this paper, instead of addressing
   the terms of contemporary UN or scholarship, as Faragher does, to see
   which terms can be used for the Acadian tragedy, I provide a
   terminological history of the Acadian tragedy. This terminological
   history studies the terms used for the Acadian tragedy since the
   eighteenth century until the early twentieth century and shows how they
   recur in the mid-twentieth century discussions on genocide. First, I
   investigate Edmund Burke's treatment of the Acadian tragedy seen as
   resulting from acts of destroying, rooting out, and extirpating, and the
   Abbot Raynal using terms for the tragedy such as embarking,
   transporting, driving away (later deporting), destroying, perishing,
   depopulating, and, indirectly, crime against humanity. I also focus on
   the nineteenth-century account of the Acadian tragedy by Catherine Reed
   Williams, who expanded Raynal with notions of barbarity, banishment,
   expulsion, extermination, and moral shock, and on others after her who
   brought terms for Acadians such as annihilation, atrocity, evacuation,
   and clearing. Second, I highlight Acadian memory in the 1950s genocide
   debate in Washington (DC) and how the terminological history of the
   Acadian tragedy appears in a document Raphael Lemkin had on Acadians. I
   also explain how Lemkin, unknowingly or not, rearticulated in
   publications and texts and found in his research the terms already used
   for Acadians as he addressed his genocide concept.},

Abstract = {While scholars of clientelism have long recognized that party
   organization characteristics influence the capacity of parties to pursue
   clientelism, the consequences of clientelism for party organization
   remain underexplored. This article examines how clientelism influences
   one salient aspect of party organization in Central and Eastern Europe
   (CEE), internal democracy, arguing that in parties pursuing clientelism,
   selection processes are less competitive, and leader domination over
   party bodies is necessary, as is limiting the influence of rank-and-file
   members on organizational and policy issues. Longitudinal analyses
   corroborate the hypothesized negative relationship for a sample of CEE
   parties and for a larger sample of parties outside the region. While
   single-shot and relational clientelism are both negatively associated
   with intra-party democracy, the latter has a stronger impact. The
   statistical analyses are complemented by a qualitative account of how
   clientelism and weak intra-party democracy fit in with the CEE parties'
   origin, ideological orientation, and broader organisational strategies.},

Abstract = {It is well known that higher economic growth benefits incumbents in
   elections. However, in the last thirty years, US politics has been
   marked by substantial increases in political polarization and a decline
   in the number of swing voters. Accordingly, we would expect that the
   effect of economic growth on incumbent vote share has declined. Indeed,
   using a Bartik-type instrument, I present new evidence that state
   economic growth has a positive effect on incumbent vote share, and that
   this effect is smaller under conditions of polarization. Using separate
   state-level and individual-level data sets, I find that the effect of
   state economic growth on incumbent vote share is smaller when
   state-level polarization, or individual partisanship, is stronger. Using
   a swing voting propensity score, I show that swing voting propensity is
   strongly associated with economic voting.},

Abstract = {Little is known about determinants of democratic support in South Asia.
   We study whether modernization theory and/or instrumentalism explain
   individual variations in democratic support in Pakistan and India.
   Modernization theory predicts that people with higher education and
   income and less religious people more strongly endorse self-expression
   values, which in turn enhance support for democracy. In contrast,
   instrumentalism theory predicts that the relation between one's societal
   status and support for democracy is negative in an authoritarian country
   (Pakistan) but positive in a democratic country (India). Using data from
   the World Value Survey 6, tolerance is as expected positively related to
   democratic support in both countries. We interestingly find that support
   for gender equality is negatively related with democratic support in
   Pakistan but positively in India. And in contrast to instrumentalism,
   Pakistani with higher levels of education more strongly support
   democracy, and Indians with higher income are less supportive of
   democracy. To conclude, our results only partially support modernization
   theory for India, and do not support instrumentalism for both countries.
   We conclude our article with a discussion of possible alternative
   explanations for these findings and suggestions for future research.},

Abstract = {This article proposes the `second face of censorship', emphasizing how
   states use censorial institutions to reinforce their value system and
   moral authority. It argues that censorship involves an interactive power
   dynamic between state censors and society, posing the question of
   legitimacy in censorial power dynamics, which is crucial for
   authoritarian resilience. To investigate this interactive process and
   the possibility of legitimacy, this article conducted a case study of
   public reactions to the takedown of a drama series in China. It examines
   how public sentiment and state responses intertwined in censorial
   practice, revealing the construction of descriptive legitimacy through
   negotiation.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates how legislators respond to an electoral reform
   by adjusting their positions with respect to co-partisans and rivals.
   Using cross-sectional legislative roll calls over 20 years, we study how
   the dynamics of blue-green confrontation are influenced by Taiwan's
   electoral reform from Single Non-Transferable Votes (the SNTV) to
   Single-Member Districts (SMD). Contrary to existing literature, our
   empirical evidence shows that the reform significantly fragmented
   legislator positions within their party and in relation to members from
   opposing parties, leading to an increase in contentious legislation and
   higher levels of both inter- and intra-party distance. In the years
   following the reform, the political confrontation between the Kuomintang
   and the Democratic Progressive Party gradually diminished, eventually
   returning to levels seen before the reform. Moreover, our analysis
   reveals that the 2008 reform had heterogeneous effects on different
   parties, with each party displaying varying levels of resilience in
   response. This finding contributes to electoral system literature,
   providing policy implications for democratic countries contemplating
   electoral reforms.},

Abstract = {This article identifies the impediments to science created by copyright
   and suggests ways to overcome these. It focuses on scholarly
   publishing-primarily of digital content-and queries whether commercial
   scholarly publishers continue to add value to research in the digital
   era. The deficits of copyright law, and potential solutions thereto, are
   assessed in light of the right of everyone `to enjoy the benefits of
   scientific progress and its applications' ('REBSPA' or `right to
   science'), as protected in Article 15(1)(b) of the International
   Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966. I find that,
   while, in the shorter term, existing copyright law needs to undergo
   certain reforms (which would all be supported by the REBSPA) to
   accommodate the needs of science, in the longer term, the right to
   science requires something else-much more, in fact. Firstly, there needs
   to be a move towards another science, a science reconceptualized so as
   not to be primarily driven by instrumental and profit motives. Secondly,
   following from that, science would need to be genuinely open. Among
   other things, this requires the creation of a true scholarly knowledge
   commons, necessitating far-reaching changes in the way copyright
   applies, or potentially its abolition, in science. Thirdly, the
   envisaged scholarly knowledge commons would have to be globally
   inclusive in scope-which is to be achieved by recognizing and respecting
   the mostly ignored international dimension of the right to science. This
   article questions the traditional role of the commercial scholarly
   publishers and argues for a paradigm shift in the sphere of copyright
   and science. Identifying flaws and gaps in the current official
   interpretations of the REBSPA, the right to science is reinterpreted in
   various respects here. In making my case, I rely on the notion of a
   `right to research' under the REBSPA and am aided by the deconstructive
   concept of `adequacy for science'.},

Abstract = {The Council of the European Union is considered to be `a consensus
   machine'. Yet, disagreements still happen at the voting stage, with
   abstentions, oppositions, and statements defining the positions of
   national delegations even at the end of long bargaining processes. This
   article explores the behaviours of Italian representatives in the
   Council from 1995 to 2019. The analysis uses roll call data to test
   expectations emerging from the previous comparative literature in the
   context of this more demanding single-country research design. Amongst
   the hypotheses, the results confirm that chairing the Council, and the
   partisanship of governments on the ideological and EU integration
   dimensions, are systematically associated with various ways in which
   opposition and dissent are expressed. Furthermore, we find that
   caretaker cabinets and government heterogeneity also reduce the
   likelihood of Italian disagreements in the Council.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to understand the scope of performance measurement
   schemes for local governments in Latin America, which emerged in the
   1990s and aim to become performance measurement systems. The article
   places special emphasis on performance measurement schemes that regulate
   intergovernmental relations in the region. Understanding the scope of
   these schemes involves revealing the conceptual basis that guided their
   design and implementation, their typologies, and their attention to
   measuring state capacities (administrative, extractive, and coercive).
   The impetus provided by New Public Management to these performance
   measurement schemes disappeared with the reforms of progressive
   governments. However, the schemes persisted in their measurement
   dimension, aiming to compare and differentiate government results in a
   more or less objective manner. The pending task lies in measuring to
   support and achieve effective improvements in local management.},

Abstract = {Many democratic systems supplement periodic elections with checks and
   balances. Yet, elected executives typically have some influence on one
   important check, the judicial branch, through their power to nominate
   justices. How do electoral and judicial constraints influence which
   policies executives pursue and which justices they nominate? We study a
   game-theoretic model of electoral accountability in which an executive
   chooses policy and appoints a justice, who can overturn policy today and
   (potentially) after the election. We highlight how judicial appointments
   provide executives a tool for signaling and commitment and also affect
   their incentives to signal with policy. We characterize how executives
   combine policy and appointments differently depending on judicial
   turnover, polarization, office motivation, or ideologies of sitting
   justices. We find that elections can moderate appointments but can also
   polarize them, reforms increasing justice turnover can backfire and
   reduce voter welfare, and distinct forms of polarization can have
   critically different effects.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to review in the long term the theory of
   transitions to propose some adjustments in it that allow it to overcome
   several inconsistencies that afflict it from its first developments.
   Thus, for example, a) when it consider that the actors of change are
   always the political elites, both of the old regime and the emerging
   one, to the detriment of social actors and society in general, sins of
   reductionist; b) it is a very rigid and closed theory in its options, so
   it underestimates or omits other possible defeats and outcomes; and c)
   it has become a highly normative view of regime change, insensitive to
   factors and circumstances not contemplated by the theory, but not
   irrelevant.},

Title = {Fitting z-curves to estimate the size of the UESD file drawer and the
   replicability of published findings},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},

Abstract = {The unexpected event during survey design (UESD) established itself as a
   viable causal inference design across multiple social science
   disciplines in the past few years. The distribution of UESD test
   statistics has not yet been scrutinized for potential anomalies to the
   same degree as those from other causal inference methods, such as DiD,
   RDD, or IV. In this article, I leverage recent advances in
   meta-analytical methodology to estimate the replicability of
   statistically significant UESD findings and quantify the size of the
   file drawer of non-significant findings. Precisely, I aggregate 1095 ITT
   coefficients and standard errors from UESD studies published between
   2019 and 2023 to fit their z-curve and estimate their observed discovery
   rate, expected discovery rate, and expected replication rate. While most
   statistically significant UESD findings are predicted to be replicable,
   the distribution of z-values also indicates publication bias toward
   marginally significant findings and a large file drawer of
   non-significant findings. The innovative z-curve methodology, which has
   not seen much (or any) use in political science yet, provides promising
   new insights beyond established tools for the assessment of publication

   to entire subfields of quantitative political science.},

Title = {INNOVATION AS A PUBLIC INTEREST OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE: A COMPARATIVE
   STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE EU MEMBER STATES},

Abstract = {Today we are living in the so-called 6th wave of innovation, which is
   focused on the development of digital innovation, artificial
   intelligence and robotics. The role of the state in its fundamental
   function of looking after the public interest and safeguarding values in
   this process is of paramount importance, not only to support its
   success, but also because of the immeasurable consequences that these
   new innovative solutions have for society. Based on this background, the
   purpose of this paper is twofold: 1) firstly, through a descriptive
   summary of the review of existing literature and research, to highlight
   the arguments in favour of the need for the state's presence in
   innovation activities, through the support of different types
   governmental policy measures; and 2) to empirically verify which of
   those measures in force in EU member states are positivelly associated
   with the innovation success of countries. The analysis is based on the
   European Commission's Innovation Index Scorecard database, V-Dem
   Democracy and the Corruption Perception Index, and is statistically
   analysed using correlation tests and linear regression. The results show
   a clear political-geographical distribution of countries in terms of
   innovation performance along the lines of the development of democracies
   and democratic practices between 1) Western and 2) post-socialist
   democracies of Central and Baltic Europe and 3) Eastern Europe. The
   statistical analysis confirms a strong positive correlation between the
   high innovation performance of countries and an overall high perception
   of democracy, the rule of law and a low perception of corruption. The
   analysis also shows a correlation between the innovation index and
   variables measuring entrepreneurial education and research policies,
   while financial policy measures show moderate effects.},

   (peuple) mu par l'exercice rationnel de sa citoyennete mais des agregats

   alarmant, on peut s'interroger sur l'existence d'une loi des rendements
   decroissants de l'information, a rebours du mouvement seculaire liant
   emancipation et niveau d'information. La quantite semble aujourd'hui
   menacer la perception de la qualite. La perte de reperes produit un
   effondrement de la confiance. La defiance croissante vis-a-vis des

   defiance vis-a-vis des institutions. Si les citoyens n'ont plus de

Abstract = {Theories of political control of the bureaucracy place conflict between
   agencies and political principals, or between political principals
   themselves, at the center of bureaucratic politics. Important
   scholarship develops measures of agency ideology to characterize this
   conflict. However, much of what federal agencies do is not ideological.
   Furthermore, some agencies have ideological missions about which
   Republicans and Democrats often agree. In this short article, I develop
   a novel measure of partisan disagreement to illustrate variation in the
   magnitude of partisan conflict faced by 93 agencies. I show that this
   measure captures partisan conflict not revealed by estimates of agency
   ideology and that agencies with extreme ideology estimates may face low
   or moderate partisan conflict. I conclude that empirical tests of
   theories of political control of the bureaucracy should take a more
   realistic approach to characterizing partisan conflict faced by federal
   agencies.},

Abstract = {Despite cognitive similarities, the relationship between religiosity and
   conspiracy beliefs remains ambiguous due to their heterogeneity and
   variation in cultural contexts. The Polish study addresses these
   discrepancies by using complementary measures, including the strength of
   faith, religious beliefs, experiences, and practices. Conspiracy theory
   beliefs were assessed using a generic measure and four specific theories
   on vaccination, the Ukrainian war, COVID-19, and 5G networks. An online
   survey was conducted, collecting 898 responses from conspiracy theory
   believers to explore the relationship. The results show that for generic
   conspiracist beliefs religious experience and religious beliefs emerge
   as positive determinants, while religious practices emerge as a negative
   determinant.For specific conspiracy theories on vaccination, the
   Ukrainian war, and 5G technology, the positive correlation occurs with
   the strength of faith and religious experience. None of the religious
   factors are statistically significant for COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs.
   The research findings highlight the need for more in-depth and
   comparative studies.},

Abstract = {The English Premier League (EPL) has drawn the attention of scholars
   from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds in recent years, yet its
   underlying economic model and the politics underpinning it remain
   underexplored within the literature. To address this gap, we situate the
   EPL within Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis (FIH) to examine
   the unstable financial foundations upon which the sporting enterprise is
   built. As such, we contend that the EPL can be understood as a
   reflection of the broader pathology of British politics since the 1980s.
   By placing the EPL within the Minsky cycle, we demonstrate how the
   actors that make up the league skirt the boundaries of hedge,
   speculative and Ponzi financiers, as the over-leveraging of clubs
   becomes ever more contingent upon debt-based instruments and
   loss-leading broadcasters to preserve the league's economic status.
   Contrary to the tendency to abstract the role of fans from the economics
   of football, we conclude that what prevents the league from reaching its
   own collapse in asset values-known as a Minsky moment-is them providing
   the `effective demand' for football.},

Title = {Small Data Approaches to Link Faster Time Scale Engagement Dynamics with
   Slower Time Scale Outcomes in Biobehavioral Interventions},

Abstract = {Purpose This study illustrates the application of time series clustering
   and feature engineering techniques to small data obtained at a fast
   time-scale from biobehavioral interventions to identify slower
   time-scale health outcomes. Methods Using data from 26 adult kidney
   stone patients engaged with mini-sipIT, a month-long digital health
   intervention targeting increased fluid intake, we identified distinct
   patterns of engagement with both manual app tracking and automated smart
   water bottles and examined how those patterns were related to subsequent
   urine volume. Results Time-series based analysis of engagement revealed
   that manual tracking was significantly associated with increased urine
   volume, highlighting the potential for active self-monitoring to improve
   health behaviors. In contrast, differential patterns of engagement with
   automated tracking were not related to differences in urine volume.
   Conclusion These findings suggest that small data approaches can
   effectively bridge time scales in behavioral interventions, and that
   manual engagement methods may be more beneficial than automated ones in
   fostering behavior change. Absent large datasets to support
   identification of engagement patterns via deep learning, time series
   clustering and feature engineering provide valuable tools for linking
   fast time-scale engagement processes with slow time-scale health outcome
   processes. IRB Approval This study was conducted with the approval of
   the Institutional Review Board (STUDY00015017), granted on 9/22/2021.},

Abstract = {Are partisans more likely to endorse political violence when politicians
   accuse their rivals of election improprieties? I theorize that for
   Republican partisans in the United States, the answer to this question
   is yes. Republican partisans are primed to believe allegations of
   cheating by Democrats and view election improprieties through the lens
   of racial and xenophobic resentments. Allegations of Democratic election
   fraud prompt them to eschew nonviolent norms of political behavior and
   endorse political violence. I test these propositions using an original,
   online survey experiment involving 140 self-identified Republican
   subjects. I find that exposure to allegations by politicians that
   Democrats engage in election fraud prompts Republican partisans to
   increase their support for political violence. Furthermore, using
   mediation tests, I find that exposing Republicans to allegations of
   electoral fraud by Democrats reduces their trust of people of different
   races and religions which, in turn, increases their support for
   political violence.},

Abstract = {This paper explains the adoption and reform of the German lobbying
   register law in 2021 and 2023 as a major policy change in German
   lobbying regulation. Using the Multiple Streams Framework and Punctuated
   Equilibrium Theory as theoretical lenses, we conduct a congruence
   analysis of 87 policy documents in a time period from 2017 to 2023.
   Empirical results show that the lobbying register law represents a quick
   solution to a different problem (a conflict-of-interest scandal) and
   explain the time it took the reform to re-emerge on the policy agenda
   due to shifted legislative priorities. In line with previous studies on
   lobbying regulation, we find that scandals need to be combined with
   other explanatory factors in order to elucidate the introduction and
   strengthening of transparency measures. These factors are on the
   micro-level and focus on how political action is channeled by key actors
   that make use of these scandals to increase pressure to act and generate
   further attention. With regard to our theoretical lenses, our analysis
   illustrates that both theories are needed to fully investigate the
   policy processes.},

Abstract = {Global performance indicators, such as democracy ratings, are
   influential tools of global governance and can have a direct bearing on
   foreign policy, aid, and investment. Many of these indicators rely on
   expert assessments. Although expert assessments are generally understood
   to be objective, this article suggests raters' identities may shape
   their assessments. It specifically examines how national identity shapes
   democracy ratings. Two data sources-an original survey of experts on
   Uganda and the Varieties of Democracy Institute-reveal significant
   differences in the ratings provided by national and non-national
   experts. In most cases, ratings by nationals are more positive. This
   article explores three potential reasons for the difference, finding
   some support for each: national differences in information access and
   consumption, national differences in conceptions of democracy, and
   in-group-out-group bias. The findings have implications for our
   understanding of global performance indicators, which are overwhelmingly
   a product of Global North organizations.},

Title = {The construction of masculinity in far-right attacker manifestos in the
   west: the reification of hegemonic masculinity and the use of `the
   child' to mobilise others},

Abstract = {Far-right attacker manifestos provide researchers and practitioners with
   insights into the thoughts, beliefs, and motivations of their authors.
   However, a systematic analysis of the gendered ways in which these
   attackers construct and present their experiences and opinions has not
   yet been produced. This study fills that gap by analysing the
   presentations of masculinity across 19 far-right manifestos authored by
   men. Discourse analysis of terrorist manifestos can unearth where
   mainstream and extremist discourses coalesce: which elements are taken
   from the mainstream and embedded into extremist discourse, and what
   parts of extremist discourse are utilised by mainstream actors. Drawing
   on the theories of Connell, Firestone, and Laclau, I argue that the
   attackers in this study discursively construct themselves as men in
   reference to hegemonic ideas of what constitutes ``the man{''} in
   Western society. They also attempt to justify their actions and mobilise
   others to do the same by appealing to ``the (white) child{''} and the
   duty of themselves as (white) men to protect it. Women are almost
   entirely neglected in the manifestos, which reflects sexist attitudes
   surrounding women's agency and presence in society. This paper
   contributes to the understanding of hegemony and gender in far-right
   discourse.},

Abstract = {The late David C. Rapoport's seminal ``Four Waves of Modern
   Terrorism{''} model has exerted huge influence over approaches to
   historical and contemporary terrorism. Structuring the history of
   terrorism since the 1870s into four successive ``waves{''}, the model
   purports to explain the origin, duration, and end of terrorist episodes,
   as well as the persistence of terrorism over the longue dur \& eacute;e.
   Close examination of successive elaborations of the model reveals flaws
   and contradictions that undermine the theory itself. Most significantly,
   its central contention that terrorist waves follow a generational
   pattern is underdeveloped and under-evidenced. Such inherent weaknesses
   call into question the model's usefulness. Consequently, the article
   argues that terrorism studies scholars should discard the model in
   favour of genuine historical study of terrorism in the past.},

Journal = {INSIGHT TURKEY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {This article documents a preliminary appraisal of Turkiye's relations
   with the newly formed Alliance of the Sahel States (AES), within the
   confines of security engagements, economic entanglements, and
   humanitarian/cultural interactions. To achieve this, the study
   investigates how the Heartland Theory and the smart power paradigm could
   assist in exploring Turkiye's relations with the Alliance. Analyzing
   official documents and secondary data, the paper takes the view that
   defense and security engagements have taken center stage of the
   relations, relegating economic and humanitarian issues to the periphery.
   This shift positions Turkiye to play a very influential role in Sahelian
   affairs, particularly in their defense and security. Considering the
   stiff competition from key non-Western countries with vested interest in
   the region, especially China and Russia, Turkiye must carefully navigate
   its relations with regional bodies like the Economic Community of West
   African States (ECOWAS) and these other external actors to promote
   regional stability and cooperation. Amidst the growing discontent
   expressed by the Alliance towards the Western countries, Ankara is
   compelled to exert its influential role in a manner different from its
   predecessors.},

Abstract = {At the turn of the twentieth century, most cities in America featured a
   patronage-based system of governance, but over the next few decades,
   patronage was replaced by civil service. Civil service restructured the
   relationship between elected officials and government employees, with
   employees benefiting from a variety of new protections. Yet in studying
   this change, scholars have largely ignored the role local employees
   themselves might have played in the transformation. We argue that city
   employees stood to benefit from civil service, and in places where they
   had agency and clout, they were important drivers of its adoption. We
   collected a dataset for more than 1,000 municipal governments,
   determining whether and when they adopted civil service and whether
   their employees were organized in an occupational organization. Our
   analysis of these new data shows the influence of city employees was an
   important contributor to the spread of civil service in American local
   government.},

Abstract = {What are the psychological, social, and political legacies of sexual
   violence in armed conflicts? While conventional wisdom expects the
   exclusion of survivors from their societies due to stigma, we advance a
   theory of sociopolitical mobilization among wartime sexual violence
   survivors and their households. Our theory emphasizes the value that
   people place on their communities in conflict-affected contexts and
   incorporates the psychosocial harms that survivor-households experience
   as well as their agency. We use an original survey from eastern
   Democratic Republic of Congo to evaluate the theory. Analyses using list
   experiment measures of wartime sexual violence show that
   survivor-households engage in increased levels of social and political
   activities in their communities. Auxiliary analyses suggest that
   mobilization is driven by stigmatization and self-blame, a finding that
   resonates with social psychological research on exclusion and social
   reconnection.},

Abstract = {With the growing prevalence of AI tools, such as ChatGPT, political
   science instructors are navigating how to manage the use and misuse of
   AI in the classroom. This study underscores the prevalence of AI in
   academic settings and suggests pedagogical practices to integrate AI in
   the classroom in ways that are informed by students' current
   interactions with and attitudes toward AI. Using a survey of
   undergraduate students in political science courses, the study finds
   that ChatGPT usage is widespread at the university level and that
   students are not confident in their skills for using AI appropriately to
   improve their writing or prepare for exams. These findings point to key
   areas where instructors can intervene and integrate AI in ways that
   enhance student learning, reduce potential achievement gaps that may
   emerge due to differences in AI usage across student backgrounds, and
   help students develop critical AI literacy skills to prepare for careers
   that increasingly are affected by AI.},

Abstract = {Does nationalism increase beliefs in conspiracy theories that frame
   minorities as subversives? From China to Russia to India, analysts and
   public commentators increasingly assume that nationalism fuels belief in
   false or unverified information. Yet existing scholarly work has neither
   theoretically nor empirically examined this link. Using a survey
   experiment conducted among 2,373 individuals and 6 focus groups with 6-8
   participants each, for a total of 50 individuals, we study the impact of
   nationalist sentiment on belief in conspiracy theories related to ethnic
   minority groups in Pakistan. We find that nationalist primes - even
   those intended to emphasize the integration of diverse groups into one
   superordinate national identity - increase belief in statements about
   domestic minorities collaborating with hostile foreign powers. Subgroup
   analysis and focus groups suggest that nationalism potentially increases
   the likelihood that one views rights-seeking minorities as undermining
   the pursuit of national status.},

Abstract = {Competition policy is one of the few truly integrated policy fields of
   the European Union (EU), with supranational actors like the European
   Commission having extensive competences. Scholars consider it to be a
   relatively stable policy domain, characterised by strong path
   dependencies, a solid anchoring in European primary law, and the
   pre-eminence of epistemic authority. However, in recent years, EU
   competition policy has undergone remarkable changes including merger
   control, projects of common European interest, and state aid. This
   article argues that France and Germany, the EU's two largest member
   states with most financial resources, have been decisive in promoting
   and realising these changes. Competition policy is an unlikely case for
   Franco-German European-level political work, primarily because of the
   supranational character of the policy field and the two countries'
   oftentimes opposing positions on aspects related to the European single
   market. Building on policy document analysis and expert interviews, the
   article shows how and why France and Germany, partly in confrontation
   and partly in alignment with the Commission, have re-shaped EU
   competition policy.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Keir Starmer's moniker of `Mr Rules' captures his deep investment in a
   rules-based form of politics that seeks to uphold established standards
   of probity and competency in public office. Rather than a mere tactic of
   opposition politics, we argue that it is symptomatic of the
   juridification of politics. By this we mean the ceding of the terrain of
   politics to the seemingly superior and separate domains of law and
   administration. Drawing upon and extending existing analyses of
   depoliticisation and unpolitics, the juridification of politics marks
   the abandonment of consciously values-based politics in favour of a
   reliance upon legal and quasi-legal (i.e. rules, norms, conventions,
   procedures) means to address substantive matters of public policy.
   Crucially, we locate this trend as a consequence of the neoliberal way
   of politics in which the task of governing in a post-ideological age is
   reduced to administration. This is significant, we conclude, because
   such an approach is incapable of responding to the intersecting crises
   confronting national and international politics.},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {31},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1536-1563},

Abstract = {The media are under increasing pressure by states to adopt a
   regime-friendly editorial line in many countries globally, raising the
   importance of understanding the conditions of successful and failed
   media capture. Unfortunately, the standard measurement of media capture
   - annual expert surveys - neither distinguishes between outlets nor
   offers the needed resolution to assess, e.g., the immediate impact of a
   new gag law. To remedy these shortcomings, we develop a computational
   measurement of media capture based on a comparison of nominally
   independent outlets and regime-owned outlets regarding media agenda and
   tone when referring to the regime. By relying on two unsupervised
   measurement methods - topic modelling and sentiment classification - the
   new method can assess the loss of editorial independence at the level of
   individual outlets on a monthly or even weekly basis. The methodology is
   validated by applying it to recent data from Nicaragua. There the
   two-pronged approach shows how outlets respond differently to regime
   pressure. While there still are limitations to consider, if further
   editorial aspects of media capture such as issue framing are added to
   the methodology, it has the potential of transforming the future study
   of media capture.},

Abstract = {Despite the global expansion in women's access to political leadership
   in recent decades, female parliamentarians remain a distinct minority in
   most national legislatures. Previous studies have linked variations in
   women's descriptive representation to international and domestic
   security threats, such as interstate war and transnational terrorist
   campaigns. However, existing research has thus far overlooked how the
   turbulence, unrest, and violence often associated with the election
   process itself may produce gendered electoral outcomes. I argue that
   violent contention in the period immediately preceding elections
   introduces gendered distortions to the political recruitment process
   that determines the gender composition of legislatures. The cumulative
   effect of these distortions is a reduction in the proportion of
   legislative seats subsequently held by women. To evaluate my hypothesis,
   I analyze data from 620 nominally competitive legislative elections in
   128 countries between 1990 and 2012. Consistent with expectations, the
   results suggest that higher levels of election-related violence are
   associated with lower rates of women's descriptive representation.},

Abstract = {The return to democracy in Argentina in 1983 laid the groundwork for the
   gradual incorporation of gender studies into the academic sphere.
   However, this institutionalization process encountered resistance due to
   the androcentric perspective of Western society, particularly evident in
   the philosophical realm where the Cartesian notion of thought as
   disembodied further marginalized gender perspectives. In this context,
   this article explores the formation process of the journal Hiparquia
   (1988-1999) as a key avenue to examine the various strategies employed
   by the editors in their quest to achieve the inclusion of women and
   gender studies in the philosophical realm of Buenos Aires.},

Abstract = {This article analyses how the geopolitical theory set out by Halford
   Mackinder is threatened by forecasts of Arctic ice melt in the medium
   term and transforms the strategic framework of the countries that make
   up the territory, especially the Russian Federation. This change, which
   marks the end of the Heartland, leaves Russia in a privileged situation
   due to its proximity to and control of trade routes and natural
   resources, but also creates a new scenario in which past maritime
   invulnerability is open to hitherto unknown experiences. Focusing on a
   comparative analysis between Halford Mackinder's theory and the current
   situation of the Arctic, the article tries to find answers to the the
   importance of the North Pole, given its geographical position and sea
   ice nature, and to the extent to which it may entail an alteration of
   the balance of power in the regional and global order.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the concept of hybrid warfare, which has emerged
   as one of the most widely used (but also most elusive) notion in the
   strategic literature on the trans-formations of war and strategy. The
   article outlines the origins of this notion, reviews the different
   significances it has assumed since its appearance and also highlights
   the major geopolitical events that have contributed most to its
   introduction and evolution. More specifically, the article shows that
   the concept has developed along a two-fold path, in effect being
   referred to different phenomena of hybridization, which have purportedly
   marked the strategic realm in post-Cold War era. As will be seen, the
   term ``hybrid war{''} was coined in the wake of 2006 Lebanon War, with
   the aim to signal the advent of a novel kind of armed conflicts
   characterized by an unprecedented amalgam of regular and irregular
   components. Afterwards, against the backdrop of the ``color
   revolutions{''} and, therafter, of the Russian annexation of Crimea and
   its intervention in Donbass, the notion has been employed both in Russia
   and in Western countries mainly to refer to an array of fundamentally
   non military (and mostly subversive) strat-egies, all of which tend to
   blur the distinction between peace and war.},

Abstract = {Interventions aimed at reducing prejudice toward refugees have shown
   promise in industrialized countries. However, the vast majority of
   refugees are in developing countries. Moreover, while these
   interventions focus on individual attitude change, attitudes often do
   not shift in isolation; people are embedded in rich social networks. We
   conducted a field experiment in northwestern Uganda (host to over a
   million refugees) and find that perspective-taking warmed individual
   attitudes there in the short term. We also find that the treatment
   effect spills over from treated households to control ones along social
   ties, that spillovers can be positive or negative depending on the
   source, and that peoples' attitudes change based on informal
   conversations with others in the network after the treatment. The
   findings show the importance of understanding the social process that
   can reinforce or unravel individual-level attitude change toward
   refugees; it appears essential to designing interventions with a lasting
   effect on attitudes.},

Abstract = {In this article, I bring together scholarship from feminist
   international relations and comparative gender politics to investigate
   how and why Jordan has implemented its policy addressing domestic
   violence, the 2008 Family Protection Law. Through a qualitative case
   study, I find that implementation is partial. Aspects of the policy that
   elevate Jordan's status in the international arena and sustain domestic
   male privilege are implemented. Attempts at implementing aspects of the
   policy that grant greater autonomy to women are met with intense
   opposition, which is justified on the basis of preserving state
   stability. Taken together, this article demonstrates how international
   pressure and national security (i.e., state-centric) practices combine
   with domestic conservatism to produce unintended consequences:
   ineffective violence against women policies that are minimally
   implemented. The analysis adds nuance to both the feminist international
   relations and comparative gender politics literatures by demonstrating
   how domestic gender policymaking processes are influenced by national
   and international security politics.},

Title = {The European Union-Intersectionality Framework: Unpacking
   Intersectionality in the `Union of Equality' Agenda},

Abstract = {In recent years, the concept of intersectionality has gained significant
   prominence in the policy discourse of the European Union (EU). However,
   several scholars have noted a lack of engagement with
   intersectionality's core social justice principles and stressed the need
   to carefully examine how intersectionality is taken up in EU policy. To
   contribute to this effort, the authors propose a new
   `EU-Intersectionality' framework to analyse intersectionality in EU
   policy, combining elements of Critical Frame Analysis and identifying
   eight core criteria to operationalize intersectionality in EU policy
   texts and leverage its politically emancipatory potential. The resulting
   framework sheds light on how intersectionality has fared within EU
   policy contexts. Specifically, it asks which dimensions of
   intersectionality are captured, and which elements are left behind. We
   illustrate the framework by analysing the EU's `Union of Equality'
   strategies on anti-racism; gender equality; lesbian, gay, bisexual,
   transgender, intersex and queer equality; Roma equality and the rights
   of persons with disabilities. We conclude that the EU-Intersectionality
   framework allows to dissect the varied and conflicting ways in which
   intersectionality is operationalized within EU policies - while some
   aspects of the `Union of Equality' agenda resonate with the social
   justice aims behind the concept, the use of intersectionality remains
   superficial and largely maintains the status quo. Our findings caution
   against the co-optation of intersectionality in EU policymaking, while
   recognising the progressive advancements made within the EU equality
   policy area.},

Abstract = {Given the rise of populism around the globe, do populist citizens
   support the exceptional authority of national constitutional courts to
   make decisions on controversial issues? Or do these individuals view
   constitutional courts just like any other political institution? To
   investigate this question, we embedded an experiment in a national
   survey in Germany in early 2020 that varied the institution (i.e., the
   federal constitutional court (FCC), the parliament and the EU) and its
   decision on a controversial civil liberties issue. The results clearly
   show that citizens with populist attitudes judge the FCC like any other
   political institution in terms of their willingness to restrict its
   authority. In contrast, individuals with non-populist attitudes endorse
   the exceptional status of the FCC compared to other institutions. The
   study suggests that the FCC may lose its venerate status as the ultimate
   guardian of democracy among the nontrivial portion of citizens who favor
   populism. Theoretically, the results support a ``fusion{''} model that
   assumes populists' support for power curbing includes the constitutional
   court in ``the system{''} they disparage.},

Abstract = {A possible reason for the lack of women in elected positions is that
   voters prefer candidates with masculine qualities. Studies have found
   that women and men politicians tend to emphasize different candidate
   traits during an election campaign. In the present study, we designed an
   online experiment in which candidates were asked to tell voters their
   best personal quality. We investigate whether candidates choose a
   feminine or a masculine trait and whether those who choose a feminine
   trait had more (fewer) votes. We find that candidates are slightly more
   prone to select feminine traits over masculine traits (though the
   difference is not statistically significant) and that candidates who
   choose feminine traits receive slightly more votes.},

Abstract = {Polarization is increasingly seen as a phenomenon with far reaching and
   precarious consequences that extend beyond politics. Despite the
   extensive attention polarization has received, two crucial aspects of
   this phenomenon remain relatively understudied: electoral polarization
   and its socioeconomic drivers. We argue that socioeconomic anxieties-the
   fear of losing one's social position due to economic insecurity-play an
   important role in driving electoral polarization. To measure the level
   of electoral polarization, we develop an intuitive metric based on the
   dyadic ideological distance between voters. Using elections data from
   federal elections in Belgium, we study the electoral outcomes of the 300
   Flemish municipalities, where we find a significant link between risk of
   poverty, income, and unemployment, on the one hand, and the level of
   electoral polarization on the other. This provides empirical support to
   our overarching hypothesis that socioeconomic anxiety plays a
   centrifugal electoral impact, amplifying the appeal of polar parties,
   thereby increasing the level of electoral polarization.},

Abstract = {In the modern American politics classroom, ideological and partisan
   conflict have the capacity to interfere with a healthy classroom
   environment. This problem is increasingly apparent when students engage
   questions at the heart of U.S. Constitutional design. By asking students
   to inhabit fictional roles with preferences and attitudes that may
   differ from their own, classroom simulation activities present a
   potential solution to this issue. In the present study I introduce a
   two-week constitutional convention simulation that centers on the
   fictional Principality of Genovia. Working in groups, students assume
   roles within various segments of Genovian society who seek democratic
   representation following the sudden abdication of their autocratic
   prince. The simulation is designed to foreshadow key concepts in
   American government and politics. It does so in a way that allows for
   vociferous debate and conflict while sidestepping students' preexisting
   ideologies and party attachments. It also provides a collaborative,
   active learning environment that fosters healthy classroom dynamics and
   encourages later collaboration. In a pre-post survey instrument, I test
   the effectiveness of the Genovian simulation in fostering key learning
   outcomes and enhancing the student experience vis-a-vis several other
   classroom modules, finding that the Genovian exercise is beneficial to
   students on several dimensions.},

   author's own work on the ``forces of reproduction{''} and their
   revolutionary potential for responding to the global crisis of
   reproduction that characterizes the present time. In the face of
   unprecedented threats to human and nonhuman life, twenty-first-century
   Marxist feminists have been striving to turn care into the guiding
   principle of a revolution from the institutionalized carelessness of
   capitalism to a postcapitalist society that can finally be careful: a
   society of caring, by all for all, including the nonhuman life and earth
   systems that make human lives possible and worth living.},

Abstract = {Social constructionism is an influential current of thought that has a
   strong impact on several fields of social sciences. However, some
   versions of social constructionism suggest implications that are
   questionable to many researchers: for instance, there is no reference to
   an objective reality; there are no criteria to discover the truth or to
   distinguish the true from the false; and science is merely a tradition
   among other traditions, such as religion. This essay argues that Marxist
   psychology and especially Lev Semyonovich Vygotsky's cultural-historical
   school can contribute to a dialectical overcoming of this dipole between
   relativism and positivism, thereby constituting a theoretical framework
   for critical discourse analysis in psychology.},

Abstract = {Advocates of the instant-runoff voting system (IRV) often argue that it
   is less susceptible to strategic voting than plurality. Is this true?
   More generally, how should we define and measure a voting system's
   susceptibility to strategic voting? Previous research in this area is
   unsatisfying, partly because it ignores the uncertainty voters face when
   they vote; we introduce a better approach. We find that, when beliefs
   are precise and other voters are expected to vote sincerely, more voters
   would benefit from voting strategically in IRV than in plurality
   (contrary to what advocates suggest). The anticipated benefit for these
   voters is small, however, and for the average voter the benefit of
   taking strategy into account is many times larger in plurality than
   IRV-especially when beliefs are imprecise or voters expect other voters
   to behave strategically. The methods we introduce can be used to study
   other properties of voting systems when voters are strategic.},

Abstract = {The research study examines the legal protection of clan-based
   aboriginal healing processes, handicrafts, and unique creative works,
   which have been undermined from the ab initio. The government should
   shield the interests of their customary know-how under the IPR approach
   and community-based legal shields and documentation in the e-database.
   The research aims to investigate conventional aboriginal know-how
   practices of the Galo clan and e-governance meadow relating to the CAK
   issue and recommend lawful aspects. The researchers surveyed and
   collected information from 46 houses in Aalo town, Darka village, and
   Kabu village in West Siang District and Basar District in Arunachal
   Pradesh, the primary sources. The paper reports on findings from a study
   conducted in Arunachal Pradesh, India, to assess attitudes towards
   customary Aboriginal know-how (CAK) and its conservation. The survey
   demonstrates multiple views regarding the significance of safeguarding
   CAK through intellectual property rights (IPR) laws, traditional
   knowledge's role in socio-economic development, and whether e-governance
   can effectively help preserve CAK. In conclusion, a delicate balance
   must be between preserving traditional Galo practices and embracing
   modernity. A structured survey questionnaire collects quantitative data
   on attitudes, perceptions, and practices related to customary aboriginal
   knowhow (CAK) conservation and legal protection. The questionnaire
   includes closed-ended questions to elicit specific responses from the
   informants regarding their views on safeguarding CAK, the role of

Abstract = {There is an ever-growing body of evidence that suggests that there
   exists a significant degree of overlap between violent extremism (VE)
   and ordinary crime, both at the conceptual level and in terms of
   patterns and predictors. Countries differ considerably in their
   approaches to countering violent extremism (CVE). Yet, at least in the
   west, one common feature is the criminal justice system, whose role is
   essentially the same for VE as it is for other forms of crime. Despite
   this, there is little quantitative research on policing and criminal
   justice system effects on VE. Among the few studies that do exist, most
   focus on single countries, and examine long observation periods. Our
   analysis compares two key democratic countries that have received less
   attention, Canada and Sweden, and finds evidence of heterogeneous
   effects and patterns concerning how arrests impact the risk of future
   VE. This suggests that studies focusing on single contexts may have
   limited generalizability and that current wisdom concerning
   deterrence-backlash effects is more limited than previously thought.},

Abstract = {Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) is an eco-system where the whole is
   more than the sum of its parts. The BBC is the cornerstone, but ITV, C4,
   C5 and independent production companies also play a crucial part. The
   essence of PSB lies in the values which underpin the content, ranging
   from popular sport and light entertainment to more niche minority
   strands. The BBC licence fee generates considerable value for the
   British economy throughout the nations and regions of the UK. This is
   multiplied by the intellectual property framework for independent
   production companies. The system is now under threat from the financial
   squeeze on the BBC licence fee, failure to deliver `due prominence' to
   commercial PSBs, new technology and changing patterns of consumption. It
   is essential that a broad range of programmes remain freely available to
   avoid the cultural, social and political divisions of a two-tier system
   of national broadcasting.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 21},
Abstract = {Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials became
   increasingly visible in the media, sometimes appearing alone or
   alongside elected officials to announce policy changes and updates on
   the virus. To what extent does varying the official chosen to announce a
   new policy affect public support for the governing party and the policy?
   To answer this question, we analyze data from a survey experiment
   fielded in March 2022 announcing the implementation of additional
   COVID-19 vaccine requirements. We draw from three experimental
   treatments that manipulate who delivers the message and a control group.
   We find no discernable difference in either political or policy support
   when this message is delivered by a scientific expert, a political
   leader or both. The sole exception is the personal impact delivering
   this message has on the Premier's rating, although this loss is only
   evident among those already opposed to COVID-19 regulations.},

Abstract = {Amidst a decolonial turn, the question of how to study ``terrorism{''},
   a concept deeply entrenched in racial, gendered, and colonial
   structures, becomes increasingly imperative. Whilst calls for developing
   a ``Decolonial Terrorism Studies{''} have already been made, I argue
   that a truly decolonial approach towards the study of terrorism needs to
   reject such a call and instead acknowledge the irredeemability of
   ``terrorism{''} as a legitimate category of political violence. As I
   argue here, Critical Terrorism Studies (CTS) needs to engage with
   decolonial approaches if it wants to continue constituting the counter
   hegemonic challenge to Terrorism Studies it set out to provide upon its
   inception. However, calling for a ``decolonisation{''} of the discipline
   is contradicting such an approach and, as I argue, rooted in the
   assumption that the category ``terrorism{''} can be reclaimed. I call
   instead for its abolition. ``Terrorism{''} needs to be acknowledged as a
   construct that carries racial, gendered, and colonial implications and
   assumptions whose utterance alone constitutes a form of violence which
   always perpetuates those implications. Thus, the purpose of CTS,
   especially if it is to adopt decolonial approaches, should be to
   interrogate in what ways the concept ``terrorism{''} functions to work
   for the project of Western colonial-modernity. It should not be how
   (Critical) Terrorism Studies can rebrand as ``decolonial{''}. Following
   from this, the ultimate goal for CTS scholars should be to contribute to
   the abolition of ``terrorism{''} as a term and Terrorism Studies and its
   industry as a whole.},

Abstract = {Through an ethnographic study of Kanwar Yatra celebrations in a north
   Indian city, this article seeks to highlight the changing notions of
   public religiosity and mass celebrations in contemporary India. This
   article will first show how the festival of Kanwar Yatra is invested
   with diverse forms of religious performance and carnivalesque
   celebrations. In itself, these celebrations especially provide young
   people with avenues for fun and entertainment that combine ideas of
   lower middle-class consumerism with religious fervour in a public space.
   However, the evolving spaces that are built, even in the momentary
   conclusion of such a festival, are based on wider strategies of
   belonging and identity, often complicated further with the involvement
   of the state. Influenced by the projects of socio-cultural actors and
   political institutions, this article ultimately argues that Kanwar Yatra
   celebrations reproduce ideas of spatial domination, exclusion and
   surveillance of communities, with severe implications for minorities,
   especially Muslims.},

   leading policy paradigms. However, it is astonishing how little
   reference the UK government made to resilience thinking in its policy
   response to Covid-19. While resilience discourse has figured prominently
   in many policy areas in the UK, there is a complete absence of the
   resilience discourse in the official policy programme during the
   pandemic. This article shows how UK government policy shifted from a
   biopolitical resilience approach centred on herd immunity during the
   early stages of the pandemic to a classic liberal policy framework once
   the scale of the problem became apparent. It is only once the
   vaccination programme-a traditional, state-led public health
   intervention-was successful that personal responsibility and herd
   immunity resurfaced on the government agenda. This policy shift away
   from-and then back to-biopolitics betrays a strategic use of resilience.
   Resilience only really seems to develop policy traction in low-risk
   situations of little public relevance. When key national issues are at
   stake, resilience is easily abandoned in favour of traditional public
   policy approaches. Once these have been successful, resilience discourse
   re-emerges as a low-cost, biopolitical mode of governing.},

Abstract = {As globalisation continues, heated debates over immigrants'
   environmental behaviours in the U.S. have been prominent in recent
   years. While research has generally focused on the association between
   political affiliation and pro-environmental values, only a few studies
   have specifically explored immigrants' pro-environmental values in the
   U.S. Utilizing a pooled dataset spanning 3 years (2017, 2020, and 2022)
   from the Cooperative Election Study and employing a multilevel model, we
   empirically tested three hypotheses regarding immigrants'
   pro-environmental attitudes: the globalization hypothesis, the
   prosperity hypothesis, and the political socialization hypothesis. Our
   results supported all three hypotheses. On average, immigrants exhibited
   higher environmental scores than the native-born population. In
   addition, we identified generational differences, with the 1st
   generation immigrants showing the highest environmental scores, while
   the 2nd generation immigrants fell between the 1st generation and the
   native-born. Compared to the native-born population, party affiliation
   played a smaller role in immigrants' formation of pro-environmental
   values. Democratic immigrants tended to be less pro-environment than
   democratic locals, while Republican immigrants were more pro-environment
   than Republican locals.},

Abstract = {Existing literature highlights an authoritarian sanction dilemma:
   Dictators must deter rent-seeking, yet in doing so they risk
   antagonizing factional allies. Using a new dataset of disciplinary
   investigations within the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist Party, I show
   that some dictators navigate this dilemma by tailoring the political
   protection they provide to their followers. Factional malleability, the
   extent to which a regime's factions are formed around mutable personal
   connections, moderates the choice of protection method. In China, where
   factions are rigid, factional allies' defection threat is non-credible.
   Thus, the dictator offers ex post protection, which is more desirable to
   him than to his subordinates, by giving delayed, lenient punishments to
   investigated officials in factionally-connected provinces. In contrast,
   under Vietnam's malleable factions, the dictator provides ex ante
   protection by excluding the same officials from investigations. The
   findings illuminate how authoritarian regimes with similar formal
   institutions produce divergent anti-corruption outcomes.},

Abstract = {Demand-side research on the Radical right-wing populist parties (RRPPs)
   has highlighted anti-immigration attitudes, political dissatisfaction
   and their interaction as drivers of sympathy for them. Supply-side
   research studies the isolation that RRPPs often face in their respective
   parliaments. Linking these perspectives, we theorize and test whether
   cross-country differences in parliamentary isolation of an RRPP can
   predict differences in attitudinal associations. Conducting OLS
   regression analyses on 15 country samples, we find that that, beyond
   direct association with sympathy for RRPPs, the moderating term of
   anti-immigration attitudes and political dissatisfaction varies
   considerably across our samples. This variation is consistent with the
   parliamentary status of the RRPP in each country at the time of data
   collection. In predicting sympathy for RRPPs, these factors reinforce
   each other when the RRPPs is isolated in parliament; attenuate each
   other when the RRPP is in government; and are independent from one
   another when the RRPP has a history of government.
   Nachfrageseitige Forschung zu rechtspopulistischen Parteien hat
   immigrationsfeindliche Einstellungen, politische Unzufriedenheit und
   deren Interaktion als Faktoren hervorgehoben, die Sympathie fur diese
   Parteien erklaren. Angebotsseitige Forschung beschaftigt sich hingegen
   starker mit der Isolation, mit der sich rechtspopulistische Parteien in
   ihren jeweiligen Parlamenten oft konfrontiert sehen. Wir integrieren
   beide Perspektiven und untersuchen, ob unterschiedliche Grade
   parlamentarischer Isolation rechtspopulistischer Parteien mit
   Unterschieden in den einstellungsbezogenen Faktoren,
   migrationsfeindliche Einstellungen und politische Unzufriedenheit,
   einhergehen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass neben den direkten Verbindungen
   der moderierte Effekt dieser Faktoren auf Sympathie fur
   rechtspopulistische Parteien erheblich variiert. Diese Variation deckt
   sich mit der parlamentarischen Situation der jeweiligen
   rechtspopulistischen Partei zum Erhebungszeitpunkt. Sind die Parteien
   isoliert, verstarken sich immigrationsfeindliche Einstellungen und
   politische Unzufriedenheit gegenseitig; sind die Parteien an der
   Regierung beteiligt, schwachen diese Faktoren einander ab; und waren die
   Parteien fruher an einer Regierung beteiligt, sind sie unabhangig
   voneinander.
   La recherche du cote de la demande sur le succes des partis populistes
   d'extreme droite (RRPPs) a souligne le role crucial des attitudes
   anti-immigration, du mecontentement politique, et de leur interaction,
   en tant que moteurs de sympathie pour eux. La recherche du cote de
   l'offre s'interesse fortement a l'isolement auquel font face les RRPP
   dans leurs parlements respectifs. En reliant ces perspectives, nous
   etudions si des differences dans le degre d'isolement parlementaire d'un
   RRPP peuvent predire des differences dans les associations
   attitudinales. Nous constatons que, au-dela des liens directs, les
   attitudes anti-immigration et le mecontentement politique varient
   considerablement dans leur association moderee avec la sympathie pour
   les RRPP. Cette variation correspond au statut du RRPP dans chaque pays:
   les attitudes anti-immigration et le mecontentement politique se
   renforcent mutuellement dans la prediction de la sympathie pour les RRPP
   lorsque ces derniers sont isoles dans le parlement; s'attenuent lorsque
   le RRPP est au gouvernement; et sont independants lorsque le RRPP a une
   experience gouvernementale.
   La ricerca scientifica focalizzata sul lato della domanda riguardante il
   successo dei partiti populisti di estrema destra (RRPPs) ha evidenziato
   il ruolo cruciale delle attitudini anti-immigrazione,
   dell'insoddisfazione politica e della loro interazione. La ricerca
   focalizzata sul lato dell'offerta, invece, analizza l'isolamento che i
   RRPP affrontano nei rispettivi parlamenti. Collegando le due
   prospettive, questo articolo offre un contributo teorico e empirico alla
   domanda in quale misura le differenze nel grado di isolamento
   parlamentare di un RRPP, nei vari paesi, possano predire le differenze
   nelle associazioni attitudinali. La nostra analisi, basata sulle
   regressioni OLP applicate a 15 paesi, rivela che - al di la
   dell'influenza diretta sul grado di simpatia per i RRPP - l'impatto dei
   due fattori (attitudini anti-immigrazione e l'insoddisfazione politica)
   varia considerevolmente da un paese all'altro. Questa variazione e
   confermata se si tiene conto dello status del RRPP in ciascun paese. In
   effetti, i due fattori si rafforzano reciprocamente quando i RRPP sono
   isolati nel parlamento, si attenuano quando il RRPP e al governo e sono
   indipendenti l'uno dall'altro quando il RRPP ha fatto parte del governo
   nel passato.},

Title = {Populist Discourse and Public Support for Executive Aggrandizement in
   Latin America},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 20},
Abstract = {What explains citizen support for executive aggrandizement? Previous
   work points to support for the president, showing that individuals who
   support the incumbent are more accepting of executive aggrandizement.
   Yet, the role of the president in shaping support for (and the meaning
   of) executive aggrandizement is unexplored. I argue that populist
   discourse increases support for executive aggrandizement by framing the
   president as the genuine representative of the people and by portraying
   institutional opposition as corrupt. Two studies support this argument:
   First, a multilevel analysis shows that a text-based measure of populist
   discourse is associated with increasing support for the president
   closing congress or the supreme court. The estimated effect of populist
   discourse is largest among presidential supporters. Second, a survey
   experiment conducted in Ecuador shows that populist and anti-elitist
   discourse increase support for a hypothetical executive closing the
   legislature. The findings indicate that populist discourse undermines
   public opinion as an executive accountability mechanism.},

Abstract = {International institutions are often challenged for being detached from
   the citizens. Focusing on the European Union, this article studies
   whether this is the case and, if so, when the European Commission
   responds to public opinion when pursuing policy integration. It argues
   that the Commission has legitimacy incentives encouraging it to be
   responsive but politicisation can suppress responsiveness by
   transmitting competing demands on the Commission from the member states'
   citizens. To test these arguments, the contribution applied automated
   text analysis to estimate the European Union (EU) authority expansion
   entailed in the Commission's legislative proposals between 2009 and 2019
   and analysed its correspondence with public preferences over EU policy
   action across the EU states, measured using the Eurobarometer. The
   results lend support to the hypotheses and suggest that politicisation
   can undermine the responsiveness of international institutions.},

Abstract = {This memo introduces students and faculty to the Food Chain Workers
   Alliance (FCWA), the 2023 recipient of the Richard Cloward and Frances
   Fox Piven Award given by the Critical Political Science section of the
   American Political Science Association. Founded in 2009, FCWA provides a
   model of how to build and sustain agrifood worker power across the food
   chain from farm to table. Its coalition illustrates key themes relevant
   to the study of how we might transform the agrifood system by centering
   the diverse workers who provide us with our daily food. Three themes
   stand out from this discussion: the importance of the decommodification
   of labor, the interconnection of labor and alternative food movements,
   and the need to connect rural with urban spaces. For students, FCWA
   provides rich material for research papers on a policy issue with
   important implications for climate change, for constructing concepts
   such as food justice and food democracy, and for studying how coalitions
   strengthen the impact of intersectional activists.},

Abstract = {This article explains why populist rule persists during the challenging
   times of COVID-19, yet democratic order is unfavourably affected. The
   authors observe the recent debates on the state government's crisis
   response and performance, which argue for democracy over populism in
   managing critical moments. Populists did not do well since they had
   taken simplistic and anti-science actions on COVID-19. Nonetheless,
   populism remains popular and populist leaders continue to stay in
   office. We offer an analysis of the case of Indonesia under the
   presidency of Joko Widodo (Jokowi). Our research draws upon Michael
   Mann's theory of the state to uncover the underlying social realities
   enabling populist regime sustainability. The main argument is that the
   complex and dynamic state-society power relations shape the ground on
   which populist rule survives the crisis, but democracy declines.
   Jokowi's Indonesia confirms this claim.},

Abstract = {Extant research has established that displeasure with a Supreme Court
   ruling typically has negligible consequences for institutional support,
   largely because, as legitimacy theory's positivity bias explains,
   judicial decisions are invariably delivered with the accoutrements of
   legitimizing symbols. The Court's ruling in Dobbs, abrogating a federal
   constitutional right to abortion services, may challenge legitimacy
   theory because displeasure with the ruling seems so widespread and
   intense. This research aims to determine whether the ruling lessened the
   Court's legitimacy. The general conclusion is that Dobbs produced a
   sizeable dent in institutional support, perhaps to an unprecedented
   degree, in part because abortion attitudes for many are infused with
   moral content and in part owing to the Court's substantial tilt to the
   right since 2020. Indeed, the Court's legitimacy may be at greater risk
   today than at any time since Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1930s attack on the
   institution.},

Journal = {SCOTTISH AFFAIRS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-12},

Abstract = {The challenges and barriers to women participating in public and
   political life have been well documented. Institutionalised sexism
   within policy itself, sexist attitudes and behaviours within
   institutions and the disproportionate level of social media abuse have
   been evidenced within party politics and wider influencing systems.
   Furthermore, the impact on women who experience the intersecting
   consequences of racism and sexism have been reported widely. The issue
   is no different in Scotland. Campaigns such as Women 50:50, projects
   such as Pass the Mic, and decades of feminist activism and
   policy-influencing have been working to tackle these systemic
   inequalities by not simply highlighting the extent of the problem, but
   identifying practical interventions to overcome them. Despite this, the
   pertinacious nature of exclusion, particularly for marginalised women
   across Scotland's politics, policy, media and influencing, remains.
   Whilst strides have been made in increasing the number of women in
   positions of political decision-making, those benefitting are those
   closest to power already, rather than women who have, historically, been
   furthest from power. This article reflects on the extent of the problem
   in Scotland, the research that exists to better understand it, the gaps
   in data that need to be addressed and the practical interventions that
   Scotland urgently needs to implement.},

Abstract = {How does rural decline affect electoral politics? A well-known argument
   is that the growing geographical polarisation of populations between
   prospering major cities and declining hinterlands is emerging as a
   cleavage of electoral politics in developed countries. But prior work
   has focussed on specific outcomes of rural decline rather than examining
   whether the geographical distribution of political attitudes and
   behaviours within countries has become more uneven in the last decades.
   Using a measure of party nationalisation capturing spatial differences
   in electoral support across districts in OECD countries over the last 60
   years, we find that a declining rural population increases differences
   in the geographical distribution of partisan support within countries.
   Nationalisation determines a party's orientation toward distribution of
   public resources and support for region-specific interests.},

Title = {Giving to the Extreme? Experimental Evidence on Donor Response to
   Candidate and District Characteristics},

Abstract = {How does candidate ideology affect donors' contribution decisions in
   U.S. House elections? Studies of donor motivations have struggled with
   confounding of candidate, donor, and district characteristics in
   observational data and the difficulty of assessing trade-offs in
   surveys. We investigate how these factors affect contribution decisions
   using experimental vignettes administered to 7,000 verified midterm
   donors. While ideological congruence influences donors' likelihood of
   contributing to a candidate, district competitiveness and opponent
   extremity are equally important. Moreover, the response to ideology is
   asymmetric and heterogeneous: donors penalize more moderate candidates
   five times more heavily than more extreme candidates, with the most
   extreme donors exhibiting the greatest preference for candidates even
   more extreme than themselves. Republicans also exhibit a greater
   relative preference for extremism than Democrats, although partisan
   differences are smaller than differences by donor extremism. Our
   findings suggest that strategic considerations matter, and donors
   incentivize candidate extremism even more than previously thought.},

Title = {So Right It's Wrong? Right Governments, Far Right Populism, and
   Investment Risk},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 23},
Abstract = {Political economy literature documents how financial investors are more
   partial to right executives than left ones. Right cabinets face lower
   interest rates, less volatile stock prices and exchange rates, and
   higher credit ratings than left cabinets, even after accounting for
   fiscal differences. But does this advantage persist if right governments
   accommodate far right parties or ideas? I hypothesize that because far
   right populism can introduce political instability, markets' evaluation
   of right executives might deteriorate if they enter coalition with far
   right parties or adopt their positions. Employing a panel analysis of
   bond spread data, and a comparative case study of the Netherlands and
   Sweden, I find that right executives enjoy significantly lower spreads
   than their left-wing counter-parts, but this advantage disappears if
   they rule in coalition with the far right or produce overly right-wing
   manifestos. These findings highlight that right parties may encounter
   tangible borrowing costs and market rebuke if they accommodate far right
   populism.},

Abstract = {This research note builds upon a number of important articles published
   in a variety of outlets concerning the population ecology of interest
   groups. Importantly, Lowery and Gray (1995), Nownes (2004), and Nownes
   and Lipinski (2005) empirically demonstrated the dependence on the
   density of pre-existing, similar groups when predicting new group
   formations. In this letter, I add to this research by modeling the
   density of ideologically divergent reproductive rights groups as well as
   offer supporting evidence for the popular Energy-Stability-Area model.
   The former is a novel consideration in the field of population ecology
   which primarily examines ideologically similar groups. I show that
   density dependence is at play among these polarized groups. I also
   provide insight into counter-mobilization movements of group formation
   by empirically demonstrating which groups are initial movers versus
   reactionary formers. In doing so, I raise important questions for
   researchers concerned with the emergence, longevity, and impact of
   interest groups over long periods of time. Finally, this research
   provides some insight into the expectations of group formation behavior
   in light of the landmark Dobbs decision.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how superpower rivalry affects public
   perceptions of international organization (IO) legitimacy in the
   hegemon. We argue that the representation of a superpower rival state at
   an IO in the form of its key decision maker's nationality can dampen the
   IO's perceived legitimacy within the rival power. We test this argument
   using a survey experiment in the United States under President Trump,
   where we manipulate the nationality of the International Court of
   Justice (ICJ) judge who casts a tie-breaking vote against the United
   States. Our results show that when the judge is Chinese, there is a
   strong and robust dampening of Americans' perceptions of the ICJ's
   legitimacy, with no comparable effect arising when the judge is from
   other countries, including Russia. Replication of the experiment in the
   United States under President Biden offers external validity for our
   findings, which may have important implications for the future of the
   liberal international order.},

Abstract = {In the 25 years since the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, there has
   been an extensive focus on the devolved institutions in Northern
   Ireland. However, less attention has been paid to the subsequent
   overhaul of the wider system of public administration in the province,
   in particular local government. In 2015, a reformed local government
   system was introduced in Northern Ireland (NI), supposedly heralding a
   period of `super councils'. Using a framework developed by Kuhlmann and
   Wollmann (2019 {[}Introduction to Comparative Public Administration. 2nd
   ed. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar]) for the comparative study of public
   administration, specifically local government, the article evaluates the
   significance of the reforms in Northern Ireland and the possible further
   enhancement of local authority powers, particular during the continued
   disruption in, or absence of, devolved institutions. In highlighting
   what continues to be a fundamental imbalance in regional governance
   within Northern Ireland, the article concludes that the system remains
   characterized by marginalized local government, with a consequential
   impact on the quality of public services and associated outcomes.},

Abstract = {Do demonstrations tend to deepen or endanger democracy? I examine this
   theme of major debate between scholars and among political actors,
   analyzing how the United States and other democracies have dealt
   with-and been shaped by-popular pressure on representative institutions.
   Cases that are discussed include Martin Luther King's 1963 March on
   Washington and the January 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol, as well as
   examples drawn from Spain, Portugal, and Italy. I offer clear principles
   to differentiate between types of protest that deepen democracy, advance
   the goal of inclusion, and others that endanger democratic principles.
   Among the issues I take up is whether the location of protest-for
   example, adjacent to or even inside legislative chambers-is decisive.
   Rejecting that approach, my argument instead emphasizes the difference
   between protests intended to influence policy-making or the political
   agenda and those that use intimidation or violence to replace the
   primacy of elections in selecting office holders. The discussion argues
   that conceptualizing demonstrations as complementary to the work of
   representative institutions can help to promote the difficult to obtain
   objective of political equality between citizens. The article also asks
   whether consensus on this matter can be attained and if so how.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {1-17},
Abstract = {In recent years, the EU has increasingly applied state-interventionist
   practices to initiate and implement infrastructure policy projects. This
   stands in stark contrast to a phase of liberalization of infrastructure
   networks and services accompanying European integration and fiscal
   consolidation and infrastructure decay during the euro crisis. This
   article argues that the new state interventionism is strongly driven by
   the changing global constellation of a ``new triad competition{''} where
   the EU is increasingly competing over infrastructures with the US and
   China. As a consequence, EU infrastructure policy undergoes a
   geoeconomic turn that aims to control transnational value chains and
   related political-economic spaces. Drawing on concepts of critical
   geography and international political economy, the article outlines the
   core features of this geoeconomic design logic of infrastructures and
   contrasts it with complementary or competing ones. The article
   substantiates these arguments by analyzing EU decision-making on two
   cases of high-tech infrastructure in the fields of communication and
   energy: the federated data infrastructure Gaia-X and the Hydrogen
   Strategy. Both cases provide evidence for the geoeconomic turn in EU
   infrastructure policy. Yet, the analysis also highlights that the turn
   is at times supported but also hampered by a capitalist logic that is
   reflected in the positioning of European and non-European businesses, as
   well as the EU's reliance on private action. Furthermore, it illustrates
   that an ecological and a social-integrative design logic to key
   infrastructures are largely subordinated. The conclusions reflect on the
   discrepancy between the EU's geoeconomic agenda and its less
   far-reaching implementation.},

   which, as elsewhere, were not always friendly and have never been
   simple. Reading the monograph encourages reflection on the patterns of
   development of Russian statehood over a huge period of time from the

   from the formation of the Kyiv state to the First World War, - including

Abstract = {This article uses a comparative method to examine the political
   perspectives of the United Kingdom (UK) and Turkiye, focusing on their
   cultural structures. The study hypothesizes that Turkiye has a political
   culture shaped by social polarization caused by a lack of tolerance. It
   also aims to compare the political cultures of the UK, which is seen as
   a democratic-stable and harmonious society, and Turkiye, which is
   characterized by conflict rather than compromise, addressing the
   question of possible transfers for Turkiye in this field. In order to
   test the hypothesis, around 30 reputable national and international
   current reports/research that provide significant data in the areas
   selected as cases in this paper were analyzed. The findings suggest that
   deficiencies such as freedom and fundamental rights in Turkish political
   culture affect lifestyles and tolerance towards diversity. It can be
   said that this situation damages social integrity.},

Journal = {STATE CRIME},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {148-172},
Abstract = {This article contributes to the study of settler colonialism and
   Indigenous resistance by introducing a novel framework: ``Indigenous
   Diplomatic Resistance{''} (IDR). Michel Foucault's theories are useful
   for highlighting how Indigenous groups use diplomatic channels to resist
   settler- colonial domination. By applying settler colonialism theoryto
   the Palestinian case, this article offers new insights into Palestinian
   resistance against colonial Zionism, especially in the time of Jewish
   immigration between 1882 to 1914. Foucault's notion of discursive power
   underscores how colonial powers impose knowledge systems that justify
   control, whilst Indigenous peoples push back through alternate forms of
   knowledge, including diplomatic strategies ( Foucault 2003: 23- 24).
   This article challenges narratives that focus on military or grassroots
   resistance, suggesting that Palestinian diplomatic resistance was
   central to their resistance strategy. This approach provides a new lens
   through which to understand the nature of Palestinian resistance,
   emphasizing the epistemic struggle inherent in their fight against
   settler colonialism.},

   Election Campaigns on Facebook},

Abstract = {Negativity is a common feature of current online political communication
   during elections. Previous studies on negativity and its impact on user
   engagement focused mainly on Western European countries. Considering the
   political particularities of the Central and Eastern European countries,
   the present study focused on Czechia, Hungary, Lithuania, the Republic
   of Moldova, and Romania, where national election campaigns took place
   from 2020 to 2022. We aimed to investigate comparatively different
   topics prevalent in the negative messages and look at users' engagement
   with negative communication. We applied manual content analysis of N =
   4,095 Facebook posts published four weeks before the elections by
   political parties elected in the national parliament. Results showed
   significant differences across countries using negative messages and the
   associated topics. The posts' highest rate of negative statements was
   identified in Czechia (52\%), while the lowest was in Lithuania (17\%).
   There are topics consistently associated with negative statements across
   most countries, such as corruption, economy and finance, foreign policy,
   labor, and social issues. However, given that those elections took place
   during the Covid-19 pandemic in Czechia, Lithuania, Romania, and the
   Republic of Moldova and, in Hungary, after Russia invaded Ukraine, we
   also identified contextual topics such as health, war, and conflicts
   with other countries and defense that were mainly associated with
   negative messages. Furthermore, negative posts generate more reactions
   and comments than posts containing no negative statements. Addressing
   foreign policy in negative posts generates significantly more reactions
   and comments.},

Abstract = {Although the relationship between state coercive measures and protests
   has long been studied in Political Science, there are a number of gaps
   in the modern research studies about the impact of repressions on street
   protest activity. A serious flaw in these studies is their focus on the
   influence of repressions on the existing protest campaigns, with little
   attention to their long-term implications. The impact of repressions on
   the scale of protest and number of protesters, as well as the role of
   the Internet as a factor mediating the impact of state sanctions on
   protests, is understudied. The article attempts to bridge these gaps.
   The author has first examined theoretical arguments in support of three
   possible forms of correlation between the severity of repressions and
   street protest activity - negative, positive, and parabolic (n-shaped),
   after which he tests relevant hypotheses on a sample of country cases
   that share the same trigger for protest - suspicions of electoral fraud.
   To test these hypotheses, the author utilized data on the maximum
   strength of repressions against civil society organizations,
   participants in protests and authors of anti-government messages on the
   Internet in the pre-electoral years, as well as data on protests in the
   first week following the elections. The study confirmed the influence of
   repressions on future protest activity. At the same time, the
   relationship between the severity of repressions and the number of
   protest participants in the long term has a quadratic n-shaped form: at
   low and high levels of repression, the number of protesters is minimal,
   at medium - it is maximal. As for the impact of the Internet, it was not
   detected on data on repression in the offline environment, but it was
   revealed on data on the strength of sanctions for political activity on
   the Web: if the share of Internet users in a country is low, repressions
   decrease the number of protest participants; if it is high, repressions
   of medium strength correspond to the maximum number of protesters.},

   role, relationship, and responsibility of advocating for antiracism and
   social justice in the context of antiracism projects in feminist
   nonprofit organizations. In doing so this paper asks: What do antiracism
   projects look like in feminist organizations? And how are these projects
   informed or interrupted by racialized and Indigenous activists within
   these spaces? Using critical race theory's composite counterstory, this
   paper uses storytelling methodologies to understand how racialized
   settlers and Indigenous folks can collaborate and thrive - as they have
   been doing - on occupied unceded territories in Canada. Based on a
   series of interviews with racialized and Indigenous activists engaging
   in feminist nonprofit organizations, these stories shed light on
   contemporary realities of colonization, including collaboration within

Abstract = {The European Union is facing a `poly-crisis'. As a result, reflections
   on the future of Europe have intensified (one example is the Conference
   on the Future of Europe). In discussing visions of Europe, scholars
   generally pit cosmopolitanism against communitarianism, or
   pro-Europeanism against Euroscepticism. Visions of Europe's future are
   however more complex and irreducibly plural. The article examines the
   ideational landscape of the EU by, first, mapping a plurality of
   prominent, frequently used discourses on European integration. Second,
   we examine a tendency towards reproducing the status quo in dealing with
   the poly-crisis. Despite the rich ideational plurality, dominant forces
   in the EU tend not to be inclined to significantly reform the EU. The
   third part of the paper examines one exception, in the form of left
   transnational populism, which proposes a critical, but constructive,
   alternative understanding of integration. The analysis of this left
   populist composite, critical Europeanist discourse, focusses on the most
   developed, even if marginal, transnational left populist project,
   DiEM25. The article concludes by indicating both the relevance of the
   critical Europeanist discourse and the formidable, practical obstacles
   the project faces},

Abstract = {In the current work, written at the dawn of the 21st century, Fals Borda
   addressed the concepts of territory, territoriality and region. Fals
   Borda's aim was to further the debate he had been promoting in local,
   regional and national settings since the previous decade and, in
   particular, since he participated in the National Constituent Assembly
   in 1991 and took on a role in the Territorial Planning Commission
   implemented during the early years of the new Political Constitution.
   Fals Borda insisted on the importance of the recognition of territorial
   autonomies and the insufficiency of the idea of a unitary republic for
   Colombia. He considered analyses that applied ``mechanistic{''} or
   Newtonian precepts to the human elaboration of space inconsistent and
   opted instead to understand that space/time takes on the form of
   concrete, yet transitory, units of human occupation.},

Abstract = {I argue leader hawkishness influences the reciprocal relationship
   between political survival and interstate conflict. Whether leaders will
   initiate a crisis when they are politically secure should be conditional
   on their willingness to use force, and whether domestic audiences prefer
   hawks over doves should depend on the security environment. I find
   support for my argument between 1919 and 2001 using a recently developed
   measure of leader hawkishness. Hawks are consistently more likely to
   initiate crises than doves, but differences are largest when leaders are
   politically secure. Hawks and doves face similar risks of removal when
   crisis initiation is unlikely, but comparatively hawkish leaders are
   less likely to lose office and more likely to come to power when
   structural conditions make initiation likely. My findings demonstrate
   that analyzing how leaders' desire to remain in power, their personal
   attributes, and domestic audiences' preferences interact can yield new
   insights about international relations.},

Title = {FRENCH DEFENSE POLICY IN 2022-2024: CHANGES WITHIN CONTINUITY},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {This article delves into French contemporary defense policy beginning
   with the President Emmanuel Macron's 2022 statements about transitioning
   to a so-called ``military economy.{''} Since then, the French government
   has indeed put defense at the top of its priorities taking various steps
   both within the national borders and in the international arena. The
   research aims to identify the main characteristics of French defense
   policy at this stage. Relying on strategic documents and statistical
   data, the author analyzes the extent of the shifts in three dimensions,
   including doctrinal, industrial, and operational. Specifically, the
   study has established that neither the 2022 Strategic Review nor the
   2024-2030 Military Planning Law demonstrates any intention to abandon
   the complex armed forces model despite its shortcomings, or to revise
   the spectrum of allied partnerships. The increase in the defense budget
   (doubling in annual terms, accounting for the 2019-2025 law also) is
   mainly explained by preparations for the planned modernization of the
   nuclear arsenal. At the same time, French conventional forces will not
   experience a significant increase, either in personnel numbers or in
   arms and equipment. Finally, since 2022, there has been no fundamental
   revision of the military presence in various regions of the world. In
   the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific, the presence of French forces
   remains at its previous level; in Western Africa, a reassessment of
   functions for the deployed contingents is underway without any intention
   to leave the continent at all. On the European theater there is a
   gradual buildup of capabilities, which is not so substantial in absolute
   terms and implemented in correspondence with NATO's general guidelines.
   As a result, the article concludes that, despite all the slogans about a
   new << military economy,>> there is still a strong continuity in
   France's defense policy; some new features do take place, but the model
   of military development itself has remained unchanged. The most likely
   prospect is the continuation of this course, including the deepening of
   Paris' ties with partners in the framework of NATO and its global
   partners, at least until the next presidential elections in 2027.},

Title = {The possibility of a Brazilian Queer},
Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {30},
Pages = {60-86},
Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyze the reception of Queer
   theories, developed in the so-called Northern countries, by Brazilian
   researchers, who propose not only the adaptation of such theories, but
   also their transformation with regard to Brazilian historical, social,
   political and cultural particularities. Thus, we focus initially on the
   contributions of Larissa Pelucio and Pedro Paulo Gomes Pereira, who have
   published important texts for the investigation of the epistemological
   and political problems of Queer in Brazil. Our concern is to verify how
   the theoretical work of the authors develops investigative methods that
   allow the development and maturation of new Queer concepts. The idea of
   the Brazilian researchers is to elaborate methods that are not subaltern
   to the Queer matrixes coming from Northern countries. That is why it is
   important to discuss even the very term Queer. It is from this
   discussion, not only in its linguistic determination, but also
   conceptually, that one can elaborate other significant formats of Queer,
   based on the dynamics of Brazilian socio-political life. If Queer
   expresses transgression through the political gesture of those who do
   not fit into the categories of gender and sexuality, it is then up to us
   to elaborate how such political gestures occur within the singularities
   of Brazilian socio-historical temporality. What is intended with the
   epistemic discussion around Queer matrices is to make clear the
   singularity of the construction of our Brazilian subjectivity. In a
   historical moment in which we have been questioning the logic of
   coloniality and the Western ways of producing science, the approach of
   part of our researchers to the Queer perspective seems to contribute to
   the creation of an epistemological vocabulary proper to Brazilian
   singularities.},

Month = {JAN-DEC},
Abstract = {The water crisis is one of the main concerns of all the crises caused by
   the current economic model. Water scarcity, caused by global warming,
   pollution and demand for different economic uses, affects the whole
   planet and has interlinked consequences, damaging health, affecting
   migration and giving rise to different conflicts, not only to obtain the
   precious resource, but also as a tool of war to subdue the enemy. This
   work focuses on showing the dangers and analysing the conflicts that
   threaten water resources. The amount and the violence with which the
   struggle for its control is being waged are increasing, as shown by the
   analysis carried out by exploiting a secondary source, the Pacific
   Institute's database. The data provided by this source shows the
   evolution of conflicts, the types of conflicts and the most vulnerable
   areas. The results paint a disturbing picture. The results point to a
   steady increase in all types of conflicts analysed.},

Abstract = {The three of us (be)come together, yes on Zoom calls and in Google docs,
   and in a way that re-imagines the sitting together at a well-worn
   kitchen table to animate our current shared preoccupations. The table
   has seen many conversations before us, so it's well-worn by feminist
   scholars who were also troubled, yearning, and adamant about leaving
   their marks. We have come to, become at, this type of table for
   centuries, sitting together preparing food, folding laundry, and washing
   up, all while also reckoning that our stories matter and can make a
   difference. In a context that is both practical and intellectual -
   centring fat liberation in public health nutrition - how do we remain
   good scholarly support to one another in and through challenging times?
   Times of dissent. Times of tedium. This chapter reveals the stories we
   need most now as we grapple with our places in the neoliberal university
   and public health pedagogy, specifically as a critique of policies that
   we read as non-liberatory. We grapple with how our complicity within
   these spaces might be considered from a place of mutual support and a
   shared commitment to unlearning and unsettling colonial ways of knowing,
   especially as we contemplate the problematics of public health
   imperatives regarding ``intuitive eating{''} and health behaviour
   change. And we ask what this means for scholarship that is accountable
   to liberation, that is, personal survival and collective healing and
   learning.},

Title = {A Regulatory-Developmental Turn Within EU Industrial Policy? The Case of
   the Battery IPCEIs},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {19},
Abstract = {The European automotive industry is transitioning from combustion
   engines to electric vehicles but lags behind international competitors.
   This geoeconomic competition has contributed to the revival of
   industrial policy in the EU. However, EU competition policy restricts
   more vertical industrial policy approaches. In this context, the
   Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEIs) have emerged as
   a novel governance tool. This article examines this transformation in EU
   industrial policy by focusing on the Battery IPCEIs. The article
   includes an in-depth case study of the Battery IPCEIs, using secondary
   literature and 11 expert interviews. It concludes that IPCEIs represent
   a gradual regulatory-developmental turn within EU industrial policy by
   drawing on developmental state theory in a European context, critical EU
   integration literature, and global production networks research. In
   response to geoeconomic competition and the region's lack of productive
   capacities, the EU is indirectly facilitating the development of
   European battery innovation and production networks by issuing direct
   state aid at the national level. However, the EU's participation in the
   subsidy race and the global green-tech race via ``green{''} industrial
   policy indicates only a partial shift in the relationship between states
   and markets.},

Abstract = {The essay reconstructs Baczko's thinking on the French Revolution.
   Founded on Enlightenment progress, the Revolution had inaugurated a
   political space open to utopia. The men who brought about political
   change and were shaped by revolutionary events did not delegate the
   realisation of their projects of social innovation to political power.
   Thermidor serves Baczko to develop an original reading of terror, i.e.
   the fears that the revolutionaries had nurtured in order to dismantle
   all opposition and neutralise any vague attempts at resistance. Terror
   thus becomes the violence that radicalises the egalitarian idea brought
   by the Enlightenment and at the same time betrays its ideals.},

   Million 311 Calls},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {We assess unequal responsiveness to citizen demands for municipal goods
   and services using a dataset of about 42 million 311 requests from 13
   large cities between 2011 and 2019. We report three findings. First, we
   find no evidence that cities respond to requests from whiter and more
   affluent neighborhoods faster than they do the same type of request from
   less white and affluent neighborhoods, even after accounting for proxies
   of neighborhood need. On average, however, white, rich neighborhoods
   receive faster responses to their calls than non-white, poor
   neighborhoods. Additional analyses suggest that these disparities may
   not reflect deliberate bias on the part of cities in favor of the needs
   of whites and the rich, but rather that non-white and poor neighborhoods
   tend to ask for services that require more time and resources for the
   city to respond to. Our paper provides the most comprehensive and
   contemporary analysis to date of inequalities in U.S. city service
   delivery.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {5},
Pages = {46-65},
Abstract = {The article advocates updating the research concerning divided societies
   and complexly organized states. It addresses the genesis and advancement
   of complex identities of social actors and political agency. The
   discussion focuses on the correlation between the structuration and
   content saturation of identities. The use of operational interfaces from
   fundamental distinctions to various kinds of divides, demarcations and
   polarizations leaves still unresolved the problem of qualitative
   parameters of identities, and ways to represent and analyze them.
   Innovative approaches developed by Russian political scientists take
   into account the relationship between the processes of world development
   and the identity of its development drivers and agency from individual
   political actors to complex social movements. The article shows that the
   effective deployment of the respective research program requires not
   only external accounting of the temporal parameters, but full
   integration of modern evolutionary approaches into their methodology. It
   is necessary to overcome the usual interpretations of identity in the
   singular as an abstract universal idea. Equally it is necessary to move
   to the study of the complex interaction of the acting forces of
   development and the formation of a dynamic flow of individual and mutual
   identifications in the plural. To this end, it is suggested not only to
   update the Rokkanian paradigm of demarcations by expanding the set of
   distinctions and making the whole structure more dynamic, but also to
   use the possibilities of extended evolutionary synthesis.},

   {[}Anonymous], 4 Describing the precise mechanisms by which ONC builds up and sustains this consensus among stakeholders in health IT is the main object of this chapter. On ``building up{''} as a practice of reality-making in actor-network theory, see, John Law in After Method: Mess in Social Science Research (London; New York: Routledge, 2004), 94 and 160,. On stakeholder theory in political deliberation, organization management, and policy, see, R. Edward Freeman, Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach, Reissue (Cambridge New York Melbourne Madrid Cape Town Singapore: Cambridge University Press, 2010 {[}1984]). I apply a convergent approach to stakeholder theory, conceptualizing stakeholders who engage in health IT policy as operating with a shared set of professional norms, while also calling attention to the constructedness, fungibility, relational nature, and ultimate contingency of those norms. See, Thomas M. Jones and Andrew C. Wicks, ``Convergent Stakeholder Theory,{''} Academy of Management Review 24, no. 2 (April 1999): 206-21. A convergent approach to stakeholder theory has been applied thusly in health policy analysis, see, Sara Rubinelli and Per Maximilian von Groote, ``Stakeholder Dialogue as Deliberation for Decision Making in Health Policy and Systems: The Approach from Argumentation Theory,{''} American Journal of Physical Medicine Rehabilitation 96 (February 2017): S17-22. I augment this approach with insights from STS, infrastructure studies, and ANT, see especially: Kathrin M Cresswell, Allison Worth, and Aziz Sheikh, ``Actor-Network Theory and Its Role in Understanding the Implementation of Information Technology Developments in Healthcare,{''} BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 10, no. 1 (December 2010); Marc Berg, ``Accumulating and Coordinating: Occasions for Information Technologies in Medical Work,{''} Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) 8, no. 4 (December 1999): 373-401; R Stuart Geiger and David Ribes, ``Trace Ethnography: Following Coordination through Documentary Practices,{''} in 2011 44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (2011 44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2011), Kauai, HI: IEEE, 2011), 1-10; Volkmar Pipek and Volker Wulf, ``Infrastructuring: Toward an Integrated Perspective on the Design and Use of Information Technology{''} 10, no. 5 (May 2009): 447-73., DOI DOI 10.1177/09720634221078853.

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted and accelerated existing trends in
   digital privacy, intensifying the balance between public health needs
   and privacy rights. This article examines the concept of digital
   unfreedom and its growing relevance post-Covid-19, focusing on the
   balance between public health needs and privacy rights. It explores the
   evolution of digital freedom pre- and post-pandemic through four key
   concepts: control over personal information; freedom from surveillance;
   respectful data protection; and the right to bodily autonomy.
   Emphasizing the critical importance of privacy in public health
   strategies, this article calls for vigilant regulatory reforms to
   protect individual rights and ensure equitable data practices.},

Title = {``The Flower and the Wall{''}: Poet-Activist Wiji Thukul and Progressive
   Martyrdom in Post-Suharto Indonesia},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Since the fall of Major-General Suharto's ``New Order{''} regime,
   Indonesia has struggled to deal with its authoritarian legacy. This
   article argues that in the quarter of a century since his disappearance,
   the Indonesian poet-activist Wiji Thukul (1963-1998?) has become a
   martyr for the still unfulfilled progressive ideals of the Reformasi
   (reform) movement that helped to bring down that regime in 1998. Using
   the developing body of theory around ``secular{''} or ``political{''}
   martyrdom, this article examines the process by which this status has
   been achieved, situating its development alongside the emergence of the
   Refusing to Forget movement, as well as comparing and contrasting his
   fate with that of two other candidates for the label of Reformasi
   martyr: those of the labour activist Marsinah (1969-1993) and the human
   rights lawyer Munir Said Thalib (1965-2004). It argues that Thukul's
   role as a martyr has been significant in maintaining progressive public
   discourse about the human rights abuses of the Suharto period, as well
   as the continuing illiberalism of the period since the end of the
   regime, and that Thukul remains relevant to efforts to stimulate and
   nurture the fragile democratisation project that was initiated in the
   late New Order period. In particular, the authors see Thukul's brand of
   grassroots creative practice as playing a central role in his emergence
   as a progressive icon and in giving his life and work international
   significance.},

Abstract = {This study aims to demonstrate how both Rousseau and Schmitt elaborated
   a common material concept of politics within their democracy and popular
   sovereignty doctrines. First, it focuses on proving how they both
   developed a common anti -formalist reaction in response to the liberal
   ideology and the political forms that were contemporary to them. In
   order to do so, the preference for a methodological approach attentive
   to contextual semantics and the history of concepts is justified. Thus,
   while Rousseau focuses on the critique of methodological individualism,
   Schmitt contests liberal attempts to conceal the political as the core
   of politics. Next, we will analyse how both thinkers advocated a
   reconstruction of political structures in accordance to a substantive
   democratic criterion, where Schmittian reception of Rousseau needs to
   complement the contextual orientation with a textualist approach.
   Accordingly, Rousseau would propose a restoration of sovereign authority
   based on collective moral regeneration. For his part, Schmitt would
   advocate a sovereign and material intervention of political power in a
   new scenario of mass democracy.},

Abstract = {Observers of North American Indigenous life and scholarship still
   struggle to understand Indigenous ideas and how they are politically
   relevant, especially regarding the relationship between humans and
   nonhuman nature. Even when Indigenous claims are warmly received,
   scholars gloss over how these accounts understand nature to be
   politically relevant. By looking to a range of contemporary Native
   American thinkers, I argue they indeed have a coherent account of the
   natural world differing from dominant modern Western philosophy. In four
   parts, I argue Indigenous thought rejects the idea that morality is
   solely a product of human relationships, Indigenous thinkers do not
   accept the is/ought distinction pervasive in modern Western philosophy,
   Indigenous thinkers insist meaning can be located in the existence of
   specific beings that in themselves constitute wholes with identifiable
   purposes, and the concept of ``relationality{''} means that one of the
   political community's roles is to build relationships with the nonhuman
   world.},

   {[}Anonymous], FUTURE DIRECTIONS Important next steps to build on the findings presented here include further use of cross-technique comparisons for the exploration of smectite hydration. Repetition of techniques such as TGA-MS and 23Na NMR alongside RH-controlled XRD with additional swelling clays and alternate cation loadings would be insightful. Further probing of organic structures adsorbed to smectite clays including the introduction of unique functional groups and direct stereochemistry investigation, parallel to controlled moisture conditions would build on the knowledge presented here. Determination of the impact of carbohydrates synthesized for exact chain length at different orders of magnitude would be telling. Future directions may also include probing the potential for mineral-facilitated cleavage of carbohydrates. To understand better the conformations and interactions implicated in these exciting carbohydrate structure-dependent findings, molecular modeling of the systems would be beneficial. The study of flocculation and aggregation in suspensions of MONT loaded with different carbohydrate structures could also be an area of future study. Overall, the above-mentioned subject areas, as well as further points of consideration presented in Chapters 1-3, exist for further contribution to the organo-mineral field in years to come. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Firstly, thank you to Dr. Ludmilla Aristilde for all the past and present kindness, guidance, support, scientific insight, and motivation you have furnished me with during my graduate tenure. I have truly grown both personally and as a researcher under your tutelage. I want to express huge gratitude to my committee members, Dr. Murray McBride and Dr. Taryn Bauerle for their insights and intellectual contributions that have shaped this work. To Dr. Randall Youngman at Corning Inc, thank you for always being willing to go above and beyond to test a new idea or to look into a new project. There always seemed to be one more sample condition to add on, and I never heard a word of exasperation! I also would not be where I am without the time and knowledge dedicated to me from Dr. Bruno Lanson, Dr. Eric Ferrage, and Dr. Laurent Charlet. I feel lucky to have learned from each of you. I am grateful to Dr. Alex Fernandez-Martinez and Valerie Magnin at the Institut des Sciences de la Terre (ISTerre) at the Universite Grenoble Alpes for, respectively, assistance with the FTIR measurements and conducting the water adsorption isotherms. Thank you to Kim Sparks of the Cornell University Stable Isotope Laboratory, Tatyana Dokuchayeva at the Cornell Nutrient Analysis Laboratory, and Andrew Masterson at the Stable Isotope Laboratory of the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Northwestern University for helping me with sample measurements. This work made use of the IMSERC PCM facility at Northwestern University, which has received support from the Soft and Hybrid Nanotechnology Experimental (SHyNE) Resource (NSF ECCS-2025633), and from Northwestern University. I wish to thank both Dr. Christos Malliakas and Dr. Yuyang Wu of the IMSERC facility at Northwestern for their experimental guidance and technical expertise. I am thankful to my funding sources both at Cornell University and Northwestern University including the NSF Graduate Research and Training (IGERT) program, the National Science Foundation (Dr. Ludmilla Aristilde CAREER award, etc.), the Chateaubriand Fellowship from the Embassy of France in the United States, the Cornell Graduate School, and the Mario Einaudi Center for International Studies at Cornell University. Thank you to my lab mates, past and present. It has been more than any graduate student could ask for working alongside such brilliant and talented people. Special shout out to Rebecca Wilkes for being with me since Day 1 of the graduate program and going through even step of the PhD journey together. It does not seem real, but we made it!! Thank you to my family for steadfast support and unconditional love. Thank you to Carolyn Sutter for being the best role model any women could ask for. Thank you to Bruce Sutter for never letting my car go a winter unwaxed or unmaintained. Thank you to Marty Kelch for calling to inform me about every potential weather event that approached the Ithaca or Chicago area. Thank you to Sarah Mellor for the commiseration, laughs, and overall keeping me down to Earth. Thank you to my cat Tabby for traveling with me to several European countries for my research and extracting no retribution from my person. Lastly, thank you to Dakota Price; there is no me without you..

Abstract = {The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) came
   into force in 2008. People with disabilities, including people with
   psychosocial disabilities, were instrumental to its development. Article
   12 and Article 14 of the CRPD, which respectively affirm the universal
   legal capacity and right to liberty of persons with disabilities, were
   viewed as key victories by disability rights movements. These provisions
   are particularly important for people with psychosocial disabilities who
   are routinely subjected to human rights violations through psychiatric
   detainment and involuntary treatment authorized under domestic mental
   health legislation in many states. We aim to advance discourse
   surrounding the CRPD and its development by centring mad peoples' voices
   and individuals with lived experience through a literature review and
   interviews with key disability rights advocates. Using Canada as a case
   study, we critically examine the implementation of the CRPD and the need
   to align mental health acts with our international human rights
   obligations. We argue that forced psychiatric interventions violate the
   rights of persons with psychosocial disabilities and cause inherent
   harm. There is an urgent need to move towards new paradigms of care that
   promote the dignity and autonomy of people with psychosocial
   disabilities.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},

Abstract = {After the trials for crimes against humanity began and in the context of
   a political polarization between Kirchnerism and the rising right wing
   in Argentina, a memorial reconfiguration of the disputes about the
   dictatorial past has taken place since 2008. In those years, a
   heterogeneous set of discourses, actors and practices emerged
   questioning the memorial narrative about the recent past that was
   sustained by human rights organizations and was part of state policy
   during the Kirchnerist administrations (2003-2015). During the
   government of the Alianza Cambiemos (2015-2019), these discourses,
   actors and practices acquired greater visibility and projection in the
   public space through government initiatives and public statements by
   some of its officials. The interest of this article is to analyze
   reconfiguration of the disputes of memories focusing on the appearance
   of a new memorial plot that questions and strains the meanings and
   representations of the dictatorial past. Indeed, the aim is to
   understand what is remembered of the past and what modes of elaboration
   it proposes, how it redefines the limits of what can be said and made
   visible in a given relationship of forces, and what are the continuities
   and ruptures with respect to previous moments. The interweaving of these
   elements will allow us, in short, to understand the complex dynamics of
   the construction of memories of state terrorism between 2008-2019 in the
   context of the rise of rightwing political forces in Argentina.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes a set of problems related to the mutual influence
   of three global challenges of our time, which will determine the
   configuration of modern society in the medium and long term: climate
   change, nuclear arms control and cyber threats. The study reveals the
   role of each of the components and the prospects for their
   transformation for Russia, the United States and European states.
   Priority scenarios of state policy within the framework of nuclear
   deterrence and information security are substantiated. The experience of
   recent decades reveals that the rejection of security treaties, as a
   rule, weakens the security of States, rather than strengthens it. Thus,
   in the course of the study, strategic objectives, the content side and
   policy options of the Russian Federation in the current international
   situation were considered, conclusions were drawn regarding the
   optimality of the chosen strategies for interaction with European
   partners in the field of arms control, the climate agenda and cyber
   threats. The authors conclude that it is necessary to create a new
   generation security architecture through informal consultations on
   strategic stability, which determine the negotiation plan to be
   discussed at official negotiations between Russia and the United States.
   In addition, the authors prove that in the foreseeable future, climate
   change will have a negative impact on the activities of armies and
   increase the frequency of their deployment in crisis situations. For
   this reason, competitive advantages in the defense sector will be
   determined by the ability of the command to adapt to climate change,
   reduce damage to military infrastructure and minimise the risks of
   resource losses due to natural disasters and extreme weather conditions.},

Title = {MERGING THE INTERESTS OF GOVERNMENTS AND WESTERN MONOPOLIES IN THE FIELD

Year = {2024},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {The events in Ukraine have become evidence of a radical transformation
   of ideas about what armed conflicts are and who participates in them.
   The issue of the legal and political status of technology companies as
   participants in armed conflicts and actors in international politics has
   become especially acute. Unfortunately, in the modern scientific
   literature, this issue is not only not resolved, but also not properly
   posed. The exponential growth of the foreign policy influence of large
   IT enterprises leaves no doubt that they are closely merging with the
   public sector and at the same time developing their own geopolitical
   agenda. In the context of the active development of the digital economy
   and the formation of a global information field of non-governmental
   actors, there is a demand for an analysis of the synergy of states and
   corporations with an outlet for forecasts of the development of various
   strategies for merging governments with technology giants. In the
   dialectic of relations between Western public authorities and IT giants,
   both sides have effective resources to contain each other. However, much
   more valuable and important for political analysis is the search for
   their ``common interests{''} and an assessment of the prospects for
   cooperation within the framework of the ``win/win{''} strategy. Such an
   analysis allows not only to assess the ``boundaries of friendship{''}
   between Western business and government, but also to use the
   contradictions in their geopolitical rhetoric to promote the Russian
   international digital agenda. The author analyzes various concepts of
   public authority transformation in the context of the digital economy,
   offers an original vision of strategies for merging the interests of
   Western IT giants and governments both in areas of activity and in
   geopolitical tasks, and predicts possible scenarios for such
   cooperation.},

Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2024},
Number = {33},
Abstract = {The ``Fasci siciliani dei lavoratori{''} (1892-1894) represent one of
   the most innovative and radical social experiments of post-unification
   Mezzogiorno, whereby the experiences of the peasants'uprisings during
   the Risorgimento connect with new socialist political instances. The
   first Fascidei lavoratori consisted of agricultural workers, who were
   united by the same demands, particularly those concerning latifundiary
   farming systems. It wasn't by chance that the experience of the Sicilian
   Fasci comes up many times in Antonio Gramsci's analyses from his workon
   the Questione meridionale (Italy's Southern Question) to the concepts
   discussed in his Prison Notebooks and his opinions, as well as in his
   reflections on politics and the culture of Southern Italian society. The
   aim of the article is to explore the main historical and theoretical
   questions regarding the Sicilian Fasci, analysing from a
   historical-political perspective their organisation and demands, through
   which the subaltern social groups of the island found representation. At
   the same time there will be room for Gramsci's observations,
   highlighting a philological connection between the Sicilian events and
   some of the main concepts contained in the Notebooks concerning
   subalternity.},

   THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of new formats of nuclear cooperation
   launched by the United States with its allies on the international
   nonproliferation regime established by the Treaty on the
   Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The two examples of such
   cooperation outlined in this article are the AUKUS partnership between
   Australia, United Kingdom and Untitled States that involves transfer to
   Canberra of a large amount of highly-enriched uranium for use in
   nuclear-powered submarines, as well as the extended deterrence between
   the United States and the Republic of Korea. This material presents the
   analysis of how (if at all) these initiatives are compatible with the
   NPT and what the most problematic elements are in each case in relation
   to the Treaty and its regime. It derives from the research that has been
   conducted that the new formats of United States' nuclear cooperation are
   undermining the NPT regime and its international standing. As a result
   of such cooperation the NPT loses its unique international legal core
   that for more than half a century has allowed to stop proliferation of
   nuclear weapons. The norms that lied in the basis of the Treaty are also
   being eroded. Such tendencies create a completely new environment and
   inevitably affect security calculus of other States Parties to the NPT.
   Against this backdrop further decrease of the political weight of the
   Treaty cannot be excluded, together with its role in upholding
   international peace and stability. Such transformations may require a
   brand new look at and approach to the international nonproliferation
   regime in the future.},

Title = {Greece's 2015 Eurozone Bailout ``Renegotiation{''}: Beware of Greeks
   Bearing ``Unpolitics{''}?},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {In January 2015, Greece witnessed a political earthquake with the
   election of the populist anti-austerity/EU bailout coalition of the
   left-wing party SYRIZA and the far-right party ANEL. It is argued that
   during January-July 2015, the SYRIZA-ANEL coalition engaged in a
   protracted process of renegotiation of Greece's bailout terms that were
   agreed between previous Greek governments and the so-called Troika
   (European Commission, European Central Bank, and International Monetary
   Fund) adopting a behaviour ruled by ``unpolitics.{''} First, the
   SYRIZA-ANEL government immediately rejected formal and informal rules of
   EU decision-making. Second, the SYRIZA-ANEL government rejected
   traditional means of compromise, such as package deals and side
   payments. Third, when Greece's creditors presented their last-minute
   bailout offer in June 2015 to avoid Greece leaving the eurozone
   (Grexit), the SYRIZA-ANEL government rejected the suggested solution and
   tried to exploit the ensuing deadlock by calling a rashly organised
   referendum asking Greeks to vote against the suggested deal. This period
   of ``unpolitics{''} ended almost immediately after the referendum when,
   in a sudden and unexpected volte-face, Tsipras interpreted the
   referendum result as a call for compromise with the Troika and accepted
   the previously intolerable bailout deal.},

Abstract = {Political parties's choices of who leads them can have a major bearing
   on politics. Recent research shows that selection procedures exhibit
   considerable variation, even among parties in broadly comparable
   European parliamentary democracies. The most common analytical approach
   is to focus on the `official story' - that is, what the parties'
   statutes say that they do when selecting a leader. This, in turn,
   implies a heavy emphasis on the final stage of the selection procedure,
   in which the decision about who will lead the party is made by the
   `selectorate'. Yet this, the `official story', is only a part of the
   process, and quite often not even the most important part. In this
   article, we seek to make the classification of selection processes more
   manageable and meaningful. We propose a typology of the `mode' of
   selection, in which the emphasis is on the management of competition for
   the leader's position before the decision reaches the selectorate. We
   identify five modes of competition: open, enclosed, filtered, enclosed
   and filtered, and managed.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 25},
Abstract = {This study examines the impact of health crisis threats on political
   participation. Health crises impose psychological costs, such as
   elevated threat perception and fear, and physical costs, including the
   bodily impact of diseases and reduced mobility, which can affect voting
   behavior. We use the case of Israel, which held three election cycles in
   less than a year, with the last election occurring shortly after the
   onset of COVID-19 but before the pandemic's full economic and political
   consequences were evident. Using a difference-in-differences approach
   that leverages the geographic variation of populations more vulnerable
   to and potentially more concerned about the disease, and the temporal
   variation of the three close elections. Our findings show that the
   health crisis negatively impacted voter turnout among vulnerable groups.
   Areas with higher proportions of vulnerable voters exhibited relatively
   lower participation rates, indicating that even the early phases of a
   health crisis, or health crises with little physical impact, are a
   hurdle to in-person voter turnout. We use individual-level data to
   confirm the connection between concerns about health and diminishing
   intention to participate in elections.},

Abstract = {Citizens' legislative initiatives (CLIs) are vital instruments of direct
   democracy that allow citizens to participate in decision-making and
   influence the legislative agenda. Despite the growing interest globally,
   there has been limited scholarly attention on Portugal, which
   implemented this tool in 2003. This study conducts an in-depth case
   analysis of CLIs in Portugal, examining their legal evolution,
   institutional design within the European context, and their usage and
   success. An original dataset characterizes the initiatives, proponents,
   and subscribers to provide comprehensive insights. While efforts have
   been made to make CLIs more accessible in Portugal, the existing
   requirements and procedures remain moderately accessible, with high
   signature-to-population ratios and lengthy processing times. The study
   also finds that most CLIs face rejection, expiration, or withdrawal.
   Successful CLIs, which result in legislation, often lead to laws that
   are significantly different from the original proposals. This
   discrepancy arises because parties substantially modify the original
   texts during the parliamentary discussion and citizens have little
   influence over the final version of the law. This research highlights
   the challenges and limitations faced by CLIs emphasizing the need for
   reforms to enhance citizen influence in the legislative process and the
   importance of balancing parliamentary control with genuine and
   meaningful citizen participation.},

Abstract = {Given the worldwide pattern that women leaders are often constrained by
   expectations to demonstrate proof of masculinity to be considered
   effective, this study explores whether it is possible for these
   expectations-and the leadership styles they promote-to change over time.
   I develop a new methodological tool to measure stereotypically masculine
   leadership style called the Ferrous Scale and apply the Scale to the
   three female prime ministers of New Zealand, where I find that Ferrous
   scores decline with each female prime minister. I conduct interviews
   with the three women leaders and examine a set of hypotheses on the
   causal mechanisms behind the apparent erosion of the association between
   executive office and masculinity in New Zealand, building a theory
   called the Succession Effect: that a succession of female prime
   ministers-rather than societal gender progressiveness or partisan
   affiliation-was the prerequisite in New Zealand to loosen the
   association between executive office and masculinity.},

   The varying role of generalised trust at different governmental levels},

Abstract = {In this paper, we position generalised trust as central to the debate on
   elites' assessments of trust in EU multi-level governance. We leverage
   one of the most influential factors in explaining political trust in
   single-government studies to understand variations in trust towards
   political authorities at various levels. Departing from existing
   studies, we hypothesise the dual nature of generalised trust: while it
   influences how individuals assess their trust in political authorities,
   its impact varies depending on different degrees of perceived similarity
   of these authorities at either the national or the EU level. To test our
   hypotheses, we conducted an elite vignette experiment involving 567
   decision-makers from public and private stakeholders within regulatory
   regimes in eight countries. The results reveal a significant positive
   effect of generalised trust on political trust when evaluating a
   national-level regulatory agency. However, trust assessments of EU-level
   regulatory agencies appear to be largely unaffected by generalised trust
   levels. Furthermore, we observed notable differences in trust assessment
   between private and public stakeholders, reinforcing our argument that
   similarity and community belonging underlie the influence of generalised
   trust on political trust. Our study suggests that EU-level political
   authorities may derive less benefit from high levels of generalised
   trust, compared to national political authorities. However, in instances
   where generalised trust is low, political authorities at the EU level
   have comparatively more opportunities to cultivate trust in them.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the multifaceted dynamics of T \& uuml;rkiye-India
   relations from 2000 to 2023, exploring their bilateral interactions
   across diplomatic, economic, scientific, and cultural spheres. It delves
   into both nations' foreign policy strategies, considering the historical
   context and evolving geopolitical landscapes. Despite historical
   tensions and differing stances on issues like Kashmir and Cyprus, the
   research highlights a trajectory of improving relations, particularly in
   economic engagements and cultural exchanges. The study underscores the
   influence of global shifts and internal political changes on their
   diplomatic approaches, with T \& uuml;rkiye's strategic pivot under the
   AK Party (since 2002) and India's assertive foreign policy under the BJP
   (since 2014) shaping their international postures. By examining trade
   patterns, institutional collaborations, and societal interactions, the
   article articulates a complex yet progressively cooperative relationship
   between T \& uuml;rkiye and India, pointing toward a future where
   economic diplomacy and mutual interests may further solidify their ties
   amid regional and global challenges.},

Abstract = {This work aims to address two alleged ways of thinking Enlightenment and
   its destructive potentials. It intends to explore, then, the type of
   self-destruction incardinated in the concept of Enlightenment in the
   version of Adorno and Horkheimer and the type of self-destruction
   incardinated in the Hegelian concept of Enlightenment. The difference
   primarily concerns a different type of concept of the negative, a
   concept that in Hegel would involve a kind of ontotheological closure
   that Adorno, but also Heidegger, for different reasons, seeks to avoid.},

Abstract = {This research explored the challenges and solutions to governing
   Indonesian border areas, with a particular focused on Temajuk Village in
   Sambas Regency, West Kalimantan Province. The research highlighted two
   critical issues: increased smuggling of illegal goods and
   socioenvironmental vulnerabilities, particularly regarding the
   conservation of endangered sea turtles. The research identified systemic
   weaknesses, including inadequate state capacity, limited law enforcement
   and socio-economic disparity factors that exacerbate transnational
   challenges. The findings exposed potential national threats caused by
   geographic isolation, and porous borders that facilitate illicit
   activities, such as drug and alcoholic drinks smuggling, with serious
   social consequences, including youth delinquency, early marriage,
   declining education levels, and increased health risks, such as the
   spread of HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, unsustainable exploitation of sea
   turtles for cultural and economic purposes also threatens biodiversity.
   This article proposes a multifaceted strategy to address these
   interrelated issues, prioritizing effective border management,
   sustainable economic development, and strong community engagement.
   Strengthening institutional and individual capacities at the village
   level, improving law enforcement and encouraging cross-sectoral
   cooperation between village, district, provincial and national
   governments are essential. Highlighting the threats to Temajuk Village,
   this research promotes evidence-based local strategies that align
   national security with ecological and social well-being and offers
   insights into sustainable governance in border areas.},

Abstract = {Why did the Liberal Party of Canada (LPC) and the New Democratic Party
   (NDP)enter into a supply-and-confidence agreement in March 2022?
   Interparty cooperationamong federal parties is rare during minority
   governments, and yet the agreement cre-ated a formal alliance in the
   House of Commons. In this article, we argue that idea-tional factors led
   to the 2022 agreement. We examine the role of programmaticbeliefs and
   strategic learning during the COVID-19 crisis and the 2019-2021
   electionsequence to shed light on changes in federal parliamentary
   strategies in Canada.From ad-hoc voting coalitions to
   extendedcooperation on social policymaking, theLPC and the NDP learned
   how to work together in the House of Commons whileusing the agreement as
   a tool to compete with each other in anticipation of the nextfederal

Abstract = {Radicalisation towards violent extremism within educational settings has
   emerged as a high profile and critical issue in many contemporary
   societies. Debates around the appropriate role of educational
   institutions should play in this regard have attracted intense media and
   public debate both in the UK and internationally. This research involved
   face-to-face interviews with 51 education sector professionals in Europe
   and the Middle East to establish an evidence base regarding current
   practice regarding the understanding of radicalisation and building
   young people's resilience to violent extremism through Citizenship
   Education (CE). The results highlighted a range of the limitations and
   shortfalls perceived by staff in CE provision and delivery including
   failings with how CE was delivered; the negative impact of limited time
   allocation on CE activity; and staff apprehension regarding their role
   and the role CE potentially plays in countering extremist behaviour.
   Some implications in terms of policy and practice in this area are
   identified.},

Abstract = {Women were identified as key targets in the 2024 British general
   election. There was much speculation as to whether `Whitby' or
   `Waitrose' women would swing the result for Labour. This interest in
   women voters stemmed, at least partially, from the fact that the 2017
   and 2019 British general elections were the first where a modern gender
   gap-a greater proportion of women voting Labour than men and a greater
   proportion of men voting Conservative than women-was evident in the UK.
   This article assesses whether the parties' attempts to target women
   voters were successful and whether a modern gender gap was a feature of
   the 2024 general election. Moving beyond analysis of the traditional two
   largest parties and their associated gender gaps, it is discussed how
   the gender gap in the UK might be changing as the party system
   fragments, with a smaller Labour-Conservative gap, but a large
   left-right gap persisting.},

Abstract = {What are the most challenging ethical dilemmas for politicians, and how
   do they handle them? The classicalliterature on ethical dilemmas in
   politics has mainly explored them as conflicts between ethical
   principles inhigh-stakes decisions. However, empirical evidence ofthe
   extent to which such dilemmas accurately reflect theexperience of most
   politicians is scarce. Drawing on extensive in-depth interviews with
   Swedish parliamentar-ians, I show that their dilemmas stem mainly from
   powerlessness. Powerlessness in politics manifests itself inprimarily
   two ways: relational powerlessness, which is driven by constraints like
   party and constituency loy-alties, and inherent powerlessness due to
   formal and informal barriers like constitutional mandates and
   limitedtime and resources. This study contributes to the field of
   political ethics by anchoring political dilemmas ineveryday democratic
   politics and by introducing powerlessness as a new central concept. In
   doing so, itsupplements our understanding of ethical dilemmas in
   politics with insights from those confronting them},

Abstract = {High profile court-curbing episodes from around the world are usually
   justified by populists who seek to minimize public backlash and
   legitimize their attacks on courts. Yet we do not know their effect on
   public trust in the target of reform. In this study we evaluate (1)
   whether different forms of court-curbing policies affect public
   confidence in their pinnacle court; (2) how populists' justifications
   for these institutional attacks impact citizens' trust; and (3) how
   support for the incumbent government condition public responses to (1)
   and (2). We fielded a face-to-face, nationally representative survey
   experiment with 1014 respondents in Turkey, where court-curbing is
   common, and the public support of the populist incumbent varies. We find
   that irrespective of its form, court-curbing of any kind undermines the
   public's confidence in the constitutional court, although presenting the
   citizens with justifications does not affect their trust. Nevertheless,
   we observe that these effects are highly dependent on pre-existing
   government support or opposition, a fact that aligns with extant
   research on the instrumental foundations of public support for courts.},

Abstract = {As the global economy experiences significant changes marked by
   increased disruptions and escalating geopolitical tensions, the Belt and
   Road Initiative (BRI) is expected to assume a crucial role in reshaping
   global supply chains. This research adds to the existing knowledge about
   the BRI by looking into how it affects supply chain resilience in the
   clean energy sector, which is gaining new prominence within the BRI. The
   study examines various BRI projects and finds that despite hurdles and
   challenges, they can potentially boost the resilience of clean energy
   supply chains by improving infrastructure, creating diverse routes,
   fostering technological advancements, and encouraging collaboration
   among different stakeholders. Additionally, the research delves into how
   BRI clean energy projects impact China's relationships with both BRI
   partner countries and Western nations. It suggests that while these
   projects generally benefit China's ties with BRI countries, they can
   lead to a mix of positive and zero-sum games in China's relations with
   the West.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to examine the political economy of the Hambantota Port
   project in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and how it
   was used (incorrectly) as a case study for Debt Trap Diplomacy (DTD).
   Our analysis shows that the port construction pre-dated the BRI and was
   a result of strong domestic electoral political incentives, not driven
   by the BRI. The Port lease, however, was motivated by domestic economic
   incentives as opposed to domestic political gains. Leasing Hambantota
   port to China was not a debt-equity swap and was a response to Sri
   Lanka's external economic vulnerabilities and provided a short-term
   solution to foreign currency liquidity constraints and fiscal
   constraints. Although it was not driven by BRI plans, the port deal is
   portrayed as an example of DTD. We reconfirm the existing literature
   which argues that Hambantota port is not an example for DTD and provide
   documentary evidence to show that lease and loan were two different
   transactions and port lease was not an asset seizure. DTD narrative was
   largely driven by geopolitical rivalries and domestic political
   sentiments in US and India. Misinterpreting the Hambantota Port lease as
   a case study provided much-needed validation for the DTD narrative.},

Abstract = {A crisis is a decisive moment that can provide an opportunity for a
   change, but also reaffirm power asymmetries. This conceptual article
   highlights the Janus-faced character of declaring a climate emergency.
   More than 2,300 municipalities worldwide have done so. On the one hand,
   climate crisis and emergency narratives imply a disruption in which the
   dominant economic system is collectively challenged, enabling citizens
   to exercise power with others for greater sustainability. On the other
   hand, climate knowledge is often perceived as conclusive, paving the way
   for greater power over citizens and towards authoritarianism.},

Abstract = {Covert foreign influence, particularly from China, poses a serious and
   inadequately addressed threat to the integrity of UK politics. The UK's
   new Foreign Influence Registration Scheme should be a core part of the
   new Labour government's response to countering foreign interference, yet
   it remains unimplemented. Tristan Yip draws lessons from registration
   schemes in Australia and the US, and calls for immediate action to
   launch the UK's scheme.},

Abstract = {Representative democracy is perceived to be in crisis in many Western
   countries. Increasing citizen participation is often considered to be a
   remedy to close this gap between government and the people. Which
   instruments should be used to realize this remains, however, open for
   discussion. In this article, we compare attitudes of citizens,
   politicians and civil servants towards a number of participatory
   instruments. We assess to what extent these attitudes are influenced by
   `interests' (operationalized as the formal position one takes: either
   politician, citizen or civil servant) and `ideas' (measured as
   ideological beliefs), while holding the institutional context constant
   (the local level in Flanders {[}Belgium]). Analyses based on a
   large-scale survey (N = 4,168) show that although the ideological
   position of the respondents to some extent affects attitudes towards
   particular participatory instruments, especially their formal position
   has a considerable impact on how participatory instruments are
   appreciated. Indeed, different stakeholders distinctly advance different
   instruments as the best way to enhance citizen participation. This
   raises questions about the potential of citizen participation to narrow
   the gap between citizens and policymakers, as diverging attitudes
   towards particular instruments might create a new gap rather than
   closing one.},

   Intention in Nonparty Political Contexts - Insights from Bangkok},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 6},
Abstract = {Understanding voters as consumers is a fundamental factor contributing
   to campaign success. This study aims to investigate whether personal
   political brand characteristics (PPBC) significantly influence voting
   intention (VI) and whether self-image congruence (SC) mediates this
   association within a nonparty context in a developing country, an area
   that has been relatively underexamined. Using a sample size of 465
   Bangkok voters, the study reveals that personal political brand
   characteristics have a positive and significant effect on self-image
   congruence, subsequently leading to higher voting intention. Notably,
   competence and charisma emerge as crucial characteristics in this
   context. The findings of this study make a valuable contribution to the
   field of political marketing and offer practical insights for
   politicians, particularly political leaders, to strategically build
   their personal brands.},

Title = {A turn towards post-neoliberalism? Housing policy paradigm crisis in
   Europe},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 4},
Abstract = {Housing policy in the twenty first century has been characterised as
   following a neoliberal, asset-driven paradigm. Are signs of a policy
   paradigm crisis emerging? Combining political economy research on
   institutional and ideational change, this article develops a theoretical
   and analytical framework to map and assess change and continuity. It
   applies the framework to a comparative case study of 147 housing policy
   measures introduced in the Netherlands (56), Spain (47), and Germany
   (44) from 2009 to 2022. We find evidence that, while key tenets of the
   neoliberal paradigm remain resilient, a renewed role of the state has
   led to a policy paradigm crisis in the three countries, albeit to
   different degrees. The outcome of the crisis sets the stage for either a
   more socially embedded readaptation of the existing `housing-as-asset'
   paradigm or a major shift towards one characterised by
   `housing-as-social-right'.},

Abstract = {Over the last decade, the phenomenon of mis- and disinformation has come
   to the fore of popular, academic and political discourse. It is widely
   seen as a scourge to civil society and a challenge to democratic
   governance, but policy solutions seem as contentious as ever, showing no
   signs of broad agreement on what can be done to enhance cognitive and
   societal resilience, particularly without treading upon precious liberal
   principles like free speech. David V Gioe, Robin Brinkworth and Marina
   Miron offer a suite of policy options that are humanities-based to
   complement the more frequently researched technological approaches to
   combating mis- and disinformation.},

   mechanism). The modes' relative presence indicates the theories'
   relative causal validity. The Integrated Structurational Analysis method
   analyzes (hundreds of) actor dyads to find evidence on the relative
   presence of the modes. The results indicate a shifting, multidimensional
   causal timescape driving the field and its outcome. Findings from a
   Japanese case study illustrate the method.},

Abstract = {The Wagner Group is often described as private military company,
   criminal organization or even a terrorist group, yet the vague
   descriptions of its nature are not sufficient to understand its
   activities. Using typologies of violent non-state actors, the article
   develops a conceptual study aiming at placing the group in the existing
   systems. It is being analyzed on cases from southern Africa, the
   triangle of Libya, Sudan and the Central African Republic, and the
   Western and central Sahel. the group's activities resemble those of a
   PMSC, a paramilitary organization, and a criminal organization but given
   the specifics of the Russian environment, it is the closest to the
   paramilitary organization.},

Abstract = {Prior to devolution, a significant majority of Scots believed that their
   new parliament would greatly improve the performance of the Scottish
   economy. We show that, in the subsequent twenty-five years, performance
   has been mixed. In some areas, Scotland's relative economic performance
   has improved particularly relative to an increasingly unequal UK
   economic model. But against key international competitors, and in areas
   where the parliament has levers to improve performance - such as in
   exports, business growth, investment, and entrepreneurship - Scotland's
   economy continues to lag. This is despite a raft of strategies, working
   groups and action plans. In reality beyond the presentation, policy
   agendas have remained remarkably similar to where they were back in
   1999. Some exceptions exist, including most notably a greater weight
   upon the environment. But the lack of rigorous evaluation or review of
   delivery of strategy suggests that, in many ways, the economics of
   devolution has been more about style than substance.},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, governors preempted local governments at
   unprecedented levels. A rich literature examines state preemption of
   local governments, but gubernatorial preemption - and the strategies
   governors use to do so - remain understudied. This paper examines what
   institutional and political factors influenced governors' preemption
   style during the pandemic by analyzing a dataset of over 1,200 COVID-19
   executive orders, classified by their style of preemption: ceiling,
   floor, or vacuum. Governors in states with high local autonomy rely on
   ceiling and floor preemptions. Republican governors are likelier to
   issue ceiling preemptions that bind local governments' hands. Governors
   in states with ideologically dissimilar local governments tend to issue
   vacuum preemptions. When non-preempting previsions are dropped from the
   analysis, local autonomy does not significantly affect issuing one type
   of preemption over another. On the other hand, Republican governors are
   more likely to issue both ceiling and floor preemptions over vacuum
   preemptions. Governors in states with high ideological asymmetry are
   less likely to issue ceiling and floor preemptions over vacuum
   preemptions. These findings provide insight into gubernatorial behavior,
   interactions between state and local governments, and how theories of
   federalism can teach us more about how governments respond to crises.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do rebels succeed in establishing functional
   institutions in state-dominated areas? Canonical theories of rebel
   governance and state formation insist that territorial control is a
   necessary precondition for the development of governing institutions.
   Yet despite growing recognition that this claim is empirically incorrect
   and theoretically limiting, we lack knowledge about the conditions under
   which rebels succeed in governing civilians in areas where the state
   dominates. We argue that low state governance responsiveness towards
   rebel constituencies enables insurgents to overcome the challenges
   associated with establishing institutions in state-dominated areas. Low
   state responsiveness increases popular demand for insurgent
   institutions, decreases the costs associated with governing, and enables
   insurgents to collude with civilians to hide their institutions. Case
   studies from Ireland, South Africa, and Algeria illustrate our
   propositions. Our findings deepen knowledge on how rebels govern and
   expand their territorial reach, and shed light on alternative
   trajectories of state formation.},

Abstract = {Studies of voting behavior in some settings may be hampered by poor data
   availability or unsuitably large units of aggregation for reported
   turnout. We propose and demonstrate a practical big-data solution to
   these kinds of challenges, using fine-grained cell-phone mobility data
   on millions of GPS locations for more than 300,000 eligible voters in
   Tokyo. Our approach uses the geolocations of polling stations, combined
   with GPS data points recorded on election day and a reference day, to
   measure patterns in individual-level (but anonymized) voting behavior.
   We first test the validity of the measure by comparing it to official
   aggregated data on turnout, and then illustrate its substantive utility
   with an application exploring the well-known relationship between
   turnout decisions and the cost of voting, proxied by the distance
   between a voter's residence and the polling station. Finally, we discuss
   the potential limitations of the approach and provide step-by-step
   instructions for other researchers.},

   the 2016 Trump and Clinton campaigns at informing voters by giving
   respondents an opportunity to name policy positions of candidates that
   they felt would make them better off. The relatively high rates of
   respondents' ability to name a Trump policy that would make them better
   off suggests that the success of his campaign can be partly attributed
   to its ability to communicate memorable information. Our evidence also
   suggests that cable television informed voters: respondents exposed to
   higher levels of liberal news were more likely to be able to name
   Clinton policies, and voters exposed to higher levels of conservative
   news were more likely to name Trump policies; these effects hold even
   conditioning on respondents' ideology and exposure to mainstream media.
   Our results demonstrate the advantages of using novel survey questions
   and provide additional insights into the 2016 campaign that challenge
   one part of the conventional narrative about the presumed non-importance
   of operational ideology.},

Abstract = {This article models the rise of populism in a country as a sequential
   recursive system driven by the interaction of voters' contextual demands
   and the supply of populist political responses. We introduce to this
   literature high-frequency media event data extracted from a corpus of
   two terabytes of articles drawn from 72 countries over six years using
   natural language processing. Further, we introduce vector autoregression
   to the study of populism, which allows us to model the way voters'
   grievances and politicians' rhetoric and policy responses influence each
   other bidirectionally over time. Our analysis reveals that voter demands
   and political responses are best modelled as a recursive system. Given
   the positive feedback loop, efforts to curb the growth of populism and
   limit democratic backsliding will require both addressing underlying
   grievances (i.e. demand) and weakening or substituting for the efficacy
   of existing populist rhetoric (i.e. supply).},

Title = {Constituent power and independence movements: On the founding and
   foundation of political orders and the meaning of political independence},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},

Abstract = {This paper links the debates on constituent power and European
   independence movements in order to develop a theoretically compelling
   and empirically grounded conception of constituent power, as well as to
   assess in how far constituent power contributes to the meaning of
   political independence. In its first part, it builds upon recent
   republican contributions to the debates on corporate, joint and
   collective agency and argues that, even on individualist grounds,
   constituent power can convincingly be understood as a surplus of
   collective agency that corporate agency cannot encompass. In the second
   part of the paper, these preliminary theoretical considerations are
   confronted with the debates about Scotland's constitutional future and
   the 2014 independence referendum. This examination suggests further
   differentiation, but also facilitates insights into the interplay of the
   constituent power of the people with corporate forms of agency, as well
   as into changes of constituent peoples. In the final part, the paper
   inverts the perspective of inquiry to show that, once one is conscious
   of the complex relation between popular sovereignty and sovereignty that
   conceptions of corporate and collective agency help us to grasp,
   constituent power also proves to be an element of a compelling political
   conception of political independence.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {92},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {How do parties target campaign ads online? Despite the growing
   importance of digital campaigns, only a few recent studies have analyzed
   whom parties are targeting. Do parties aim to persuade or mobilize
   voters? This paper analyzes how parties target and how they differ in
   their use of targeting using a new and comprehensive dataset, matching
   data from the Facebook Ad Library with EES survey responses. The dataset
   contains over 100,000 Facebook and Instagram ads from 148 parties for
   the 2019 European Parliament elections. The results show that smaller
   and niche parties have targeting strategies more narrowly focused on
   their supporters, whereas larger parties target a broader audience. My
   findings have important implications for research on voter targeting and
   the ongoing debate about the regulation of campaigns online.},

   abolitionism},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {390-407},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The present article is a sympathetic critique of the most prominent
   contemporary articulations of family abolitionism. It examines whether
   queer communist family abolitionism is successful in linking an account
   of reasons for abolition, with an account of the means of abolition, and
   finally with an account of the ends of abolition in the form of
   speculation on a possible world without families. Recent work by M.E.
   O'Brien has developed these connections in ways that have never been
   done so thoroughly before; but the rejection of states as an
   institutional form of political power leaves it unclear what forms of
   equality we could expect in such a world, and why coercive power would
   be unnecessary there. Family abolition is a utopian political agenda;
   but that utopianism needs to be constrained by a realist concern with
   issues of power, resources, and human capacities. This will require
   confronting trade-offs and imperfections within possible worlds without
   families. The recognition that there are many paths to a world without
   families, and many possible such worlds, is the first step towards
   aligning reasons, means, and ends and confronting the social and
   political trade-offs that this entails.},

Title = {The national network of US state legislators on Twitter},
Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 16},
Abstract = {Networks among legislators shape politics and policymaking within
   legislative institutions. In past work on legislative networks, the ties
   between legislators have been defined on those who serve in the same
   legislature or chamber. Online information networks, which have been
   found to play important roles in legislative communication at the
   national level, are not bounded by individual legislative bodies. We
   collect original data for over four thousand US state legislators and
   study patterns of connection among them on Twitter. We look at three
   types of Twitter networks-follower, retweets, and mentions. We describe
   these networks and estimate the relationships between ties and salient
   attributes of legislators. We find that networks are organized largely
   along geographic and partisan lines and that identity attributes-namely
   gender and race-exhibit strong associations with the formation of ties.},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Subnational variations in political culture and policy attitudes are a
   hallmark feature of multilevel systems of government, yet we know
   comparatively little about how and why citizens of these systems
   subjectively perceive regional differences in political values. Using
   data from a specially commissioned survey under the auspices of the
   Provincial Diversity Project, this article analyses subjective
   perceptions of difference across provinces in Canada. It shows that
   individuals believe their regions have distinct political values, but
   also that they systematically overestimate that difference. In their
   estimations of regional distinctiveness, individuals are informed by the
   value profiles of the regions in which they live, but also by their own
   policy preferences. The findings clarify the salience of internal
   boundaries within multilevel or federal states, and enable us to
   understand how myths of distinctiveness flourish, but also provide an
   important extension on debates about misperceptions in politics.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I examine cognitive reflection, i.e., the ability to
   suppress one's spontaneous intuition to engage in higher-level
   analytical thinking, as a predictor of populist attitudes and candidate
   preferences. I develop a set of hypotheses which link the ideological
   content of populism to lower levels of cognitive reflection. I test
   these hypotheses with an original survey conducted on a representative
   sample of the UK population, in which respondents were asked to complete
   a cognitive reflection test, answer questions from a scale of populist
   attitudes, and respond to a conjoint experiment of hypothetical
   parliamentary candidates whose populist ideology is randomly attributed.
   I find that populist attitudes are negatively associated with cognitive
   reflection (p < 0.05). Furthermore, I also find suggestive evidence that
   anti-elite and conflict-seeking conjoint attributes interact negatively
   with respondent-level cognitive reflection on the formation of conjoint
   preferences (p < 0.1). However, I find no such interaction with respect
   to people centric attributes.},

   Pakistan's energy security and evaluates the way forward for Pakistan to
   counter security threats. The study contends the Abraham Accord and
   Middle Eastern QUAD have extended the influence of India and Israel from
   the Middle East to the Indian Ocean, thereby increasing the risk to
   Pakistan's energy supplies. Meanwhile, expanded and intensified
   securitization of the Strait of Hormuz has likewise increased the
   vulnerability of energy supplies from the Middle East. Pakistan imports
   72\% of its energy from the Middle East via the Strait of Hormuz, and
   any disruption in energy supplies or blockade of maritime routes would
   severely undermine Pakistan's socioeconomic and political stability.
   Pakistan, we argue, must therefore diversify its energy imports from
   Russia, Central Asia, and Iran to safeguard its energy interests.},

Abstract = {Studies of public opinion on welfare policies implement increasingly
   concrete and complex survey measures that frequently assume relative
   preferences on the part of respondents. Yet, we lack evidence on whether
   voters hold such structured attitudes toward welfare policies. We rely
   on novel survey data from eight West European countries to study
   horizontal attitudinal constraint in welfare policy preferences.
   Addressing both logical and relational consistency, we find that most
   respondents hold structured welfare belief systems and relative
   preferences about where reform is more important, even when confronted
   with complex questions and explicit trade-offs. Moreover, by addressing
   individual-level heterogeneity, we show that differences related to
   sociodemographic factors and political attitudes are rather minor.
   Consistent welfare preferences are not exclusive to highly sophisticated
   individuals. These results have important implications for survey
   research implementing increasingly complex measures of preferences, such
   as explicit trade-offs or rating tasks, in social policy as well as in
   other policy areas.},

Abstract = {Interstate and intrastate conflicts are nested in broader networks of
   rivalry and cooperation and can be modeled as such. An intergroup
   security dilemma logic points to trade-offs states face as they
   cultivate ``support groups{''}-receiving security assistance has the
   potential to attract aggression and subversion from other states.
   Hypotheses from this logic are evaluated using stochastic actor-oriented
   models treating support ties, interstate threat ties, and intrastate
   conflict as mutually constitutive. The results show that support groups
   with high military capacity but low levels of interest congruence are
   associated with higher propensities for interstate threat and intrastate
   conflict. Support groups with both high levels of interest congruence
   and high military capacity do not experience an increase in propensity
   for interstate threat or intrastate conflict. A novel finding emerges:
   the same types of support relationships that are associated with
   interstate threats also are associated with intrastate conflict.},

Abstract = {On the one hand, it seems important to bring real citizens into the
   constitutional processes of making and amending constitutions. This is
   important in order to foster a sense of ownership and commitment to
   constitutional principles, have those documents reflect the interests
   and concerns of ordinary people, and fulfill the principles of popular
   sovereignty and constituent authority of the people. On the other hand,
   there are many misgivings about handing over decisional power to the
   people (for example through referendums) on constitutional issues. The
   worry here is that these means of bringing citizen into the process are
   easily hijacked by majoritarian or populist forces and may be used to
   undermine rather than strengthen principles of constitutional democracy.
   Constitutions are, among other things, supposed to protect individuals
   and minorities from majorities. This is the classic tension between
   democracy and constitutionalism. One solution is to shift ideas of
   popular sovereignty away from voting and towards fostering public
   dialogue. In this paper, I argue that one of the most effective ways to
   foster public dialogue about constitutional essentials is through
   initiating a referendum. Thus I defend constitutional referendums on the
   counterintuitive grounds that if properly structured they are effective
   in promoting the recognition of the limits of majoritarianism.},

Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between crimes attributed to
   immigrants and hate crimes against refugees at the local level. We argue
   that local crime events can lead natives to engage in vicarious
   retribution against uninvolved out-group members-refugees in our
   setting. Our empirical analysis relies on fine-grained geocoded data on
   more than 9,400 hate crimes and 17,600 immigrant-attributed crime events
   that occurred in Germany between 2015 and 2019. Using a regression
   discontinuity in time design, we show that the daily probability of a
   hate crime against refugees rises sharply in the immediate aftermath of
   an immigrant-attributed crime event in a local community. Additional
   analyses suggest that immigrant-attributed crime acts as an emotional
   ``trigger,{''} particularly in areas with strong radical-right support
   and recent demographic change. Our findings imply that individual
   commonplace crime incidents can give rise to intergroup conflict
   dynamics at the local level.},

Title = {Explaining Variation in Political Leadership by Marginalized Groups:
   Black Office-Holding and Contraband Camps},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Abstract = {What explains variation in rates of political office-holding by
   marginalized groups? We argue that a certain social infrastructure
   facilitates office-holding, but dominant social groups tend to
   monopolize this infrastructure and in turn office-holding. In places
   exposed to a limitation on dominant groups' monopolization of this
   social infrastructure, marginalized groups can access it and hold office
   at higher rates than marginalized groups who were not exposed to this
   limitation. We test our argument using the creation of ``contraband
   camps{''} during the US Civil War. These camps limited White men's
   monopolization of the social infrastructure of political participation.
   We therefore expect higher rates of Black office-holding in counties
   exposed to contraband camps, relative to counties in the same state
   without camps. Quantitative results relying on existing and original
   data indicate that counties with camps produced almost twice as many
   Black political leaders as similar counties in the same state without a
   camp.},

Abstract = {Across Western democracies, education levels are predictive of
   immigration attitudes and voting for new left or far right parties. What
   explains education-based political divides? This article proposes that
   social closure of higher- and lower-educated citizens strengthens and
   reinforces differences in political attitudes and voting between them.
   Using social network data from the Netherlands, and ESS data, we show
   that large proportions of higher- and lower-educated citizens report no
   close relationships with different education levels. Network education
   levels, in turn, are predictive of immigration attitudes and voting
   behaviour. Difference-in-differences models show that a change in
   network education levels is associated with change in these outcomes.
   Our findings contribute to literatures on educational divides and peer
   effects. Moreover, they support an interpretation of political
   competition on the universalist-particularist dimension as durably
   rooted in social structure. Sizable, distinct and insulated educational
   groups can crystallize contemporary divides and predictably shape
   political reality.},

Abstract = {This forum article provides an overview of the sampling and survey
   design of the publicly available InterCov dataset. The two-wave
   cross-country survey includes items on lobbying mobilisation,
   strategies, access and influence after the outbreak of the COVID-19
   pandemic, and other measures of organisational factors. We discuss
   design choices considering our interest in lobbying dynamics following a
   focusing event, the responsiveness of organisations and political
   gatekeepers to external shocks, and the role of timing in lobbying. We
   address our bottom-up sampling approach, draw lessons from the
   implementation of a second survey wave and provide an overview of survey
   items. We hope that this forum article is useful for scholars aiming to
   use our dataset and those starting new data collection efforts.},

Title = {Why governments want to learn about citizens' preferences. Explaining
   the representational logic behind government polling},

Abstract = {While it is generally admitted that governments in most democracies make
   extensive use of public opinion research, we do not know much about the
   way they mobilize this resource. When and why do they want to learn
   about public opinion? What determines differences in the intensity of
   government polling over the electoral cycle? Are government opinion
   polls primarily a tool for testing the reception of government proposals
   or for learning more about issues that are important to citizens? And
   what does this tell us about the way political representation works?
   Understanding governments as actors in the production of public opinion,
   not just as passive consumers, our focus is on polls commissioned
   directly by governments. We argue that government polls can help us to
   better understand how contemporary political representation works since
   they can play an important role as `update instrument' in anticipatory
   representation or as a decision-making aid in promissory representation.
   By studying government polls as dependent variable, we develop an
   innovative research design and systematically analyse the factors that
   explain whether the intensity of government polling (the number of
   questions asked) varies across different stages of the electoral cycle
   and whether the issues they ask about correspond more to the
   government's priorities or those of the public. We present evidence from
   Germany, mobilizing an original database of all survey questions
   directly commissioned by the German government during the 18th and 19th
   legislative periods (2013-2021). Our findings help to better understand
   the factors that determine the intensity of government polling at
   different moments of the electoral cycle and to identify the different
   logic of representation behind this activity. The transition from the
   post-election period to the routine period and from the routine period
   to the pre-election period correspond to turning points in the German
   government's use of this instrument. While we could not observe any
   direct effects of the electoral cycle on the intensity of government
   polling, the interplay between the former and different types of policy
   issues proves to be insightful. The government commissions significantly
   more survey questions on government priorities during the first 3 months
   in office than during routine times and significantly more survey
   questions on salient issues as federal elections approach. Moreover, we
   show that governments commission fewer questions on issues they `own',
   which points in the same direction as previous studies showing that
   governments are less interested in public opinion on these issues.},

Abstract = {The Social Security Act of 1935 and its 1939 amendments included federal
   programs for maternal and infant welfare, child welfare services, and
   Aid to Dependent Children (ADC). Inclusion of these programs is largely
   owing to women reformers' long advocacy for public assistance to
   families in need. The Social Security Act nationalized aspects of the
   program championed by the Children's Bureau, itself a product of women's
   civic organization and institution building. These advances laid the
   ground for crucial components of the contemporary American welfare
   state, which included surveillance and intrusion into the lives of ADC
   families and the perpetuation of a system of subnational administration
   that reproduced racial inequality. Yet critics of these female reformers
   have not fully considered the institutional constraints they faced and
   the policy transformations they did not control. This article considers
   the policy achievement of maternalists in terms of its policy failures
   by considering the bureaucratic struggles of female reformers once they
   reached access to federal policymaking, culminating in the Committee on
   Economic Security that led to the Social Security Act. We consider the
   strategies from a place of both access and marginalization as they
   jockeyed for bureaucratic territory with others with different claims to
   expertise.},

Abstract = {Affective polarization is increasingly evident around the world. This
   has been attributed in part to residential segregation by partisanship.
   The `Big Sort' has meant that neighbourhoods in the United States, and
   elsewhere, have become more homogenous in terms of vote. Yet there is
   little systematic evidence on the relationship between homogenous
   partisan neighbourhoods and affective polarization. Does living among
   fellow partisans make people more negative towards the other side? In
   this Research Note, we use unique data from Britain to show that while
   people accurately recognize that their local area is more or less
   politically homogenous, neighbourhood political homogeneity is not
   correlated with any measure of affective polarization. These findings
   are robust to the type of political divide (partisanship or Brexit
   identity), the level of geography, length of residence and controls for
   ideology and social characteristics. We therefore suggest that while
   geographical sorting is an important phenomenon, it is unlikely to be a
   major cause of affective polarization.},

Abstract = {The role of civil society during and after the Presidential Elections of
   2015 in Sri Lanka created a new era in democracy-building. Civil society
   played a decisive role in bringing the National Unity Government (NUG)
   into power in 2015 and revived the space for civil society to
   consolidate democracy with much waited reforms in the political and
   governance spheres amidst challenges on the part of ethno-religious
   forces. The article thus explores the role played by CSOs in building
   democracy during NUG (2015-2019). The article demonstrates that, while
   Sri Lanka's CSOs made significant progress toward democratic
   consolidation during the NUG, there is still a long way to go to ensure
   that a democratic political culture pervades all aspects of citizens'
   lives which is possible only through political institutionalization.
   Despite Sri Lanka's democratic accomplishments since 1931, efforts to
   consolidate democracy face challenges that have the potential to derail
   the gains made in the democratic consolidation process. The article
   claims that the single most critical factor in the consolidation of
   democracy is not only civil society but also political
   institutionalization. Though the article focuses on Sri Lanka, it does
   provide lessons for other developing countries that encounter democratic
   recession.},

Abstract = {Although presidential vetoes are central to the legislative process, the
   role of total versus line item vetoes (LIV) is largely unclear. While
   total vetoes are a sign of conflict between the branches, as the
   literature has emphasized, we argue that LIV function as a negative
   agenda setting mechanism that enables presidents to coordinate within
   their coalition. To test our argument, we use an original dataset on all
   statutes and executive decrees approved and vetoed in Brazil for the
   period 1988-2010. In both, statutes and decrees, we show that while
   total vetoes occur when conflict between branches is stronger, LIV
   happen when such conflict is minimal and presidents have tight control
   over their coalition. The results are robust across dependent variables,
   model specifications, and estimation strategies. Our findings highlight
   that while the total veto is a blunt bargaining mechanism, the LIV
   provides a scalpel, a much finer tool that helps presidents manage and
   sustain their congressional coalition.},

Abstract = {In this article, we compare the voter profile of Trump, Erdogan and
   Bolsonaro voters to decipher if the voter profile for any of the three
   leaders matches their type of right-wing populism. Through original
   survey research in the US, Brazil and Turkey conducted in October 2021
   with 1000 participants in each country, we find support for this
   proposition; that is, the voter profile for any of the three presidents
   is distinct with the exception that voters of all three populists are
   morally conservative in terms of their views on homosexuality and
   abortion. Trump voters tend to be ethnically driven and reject
   minorities. For Bolsonaro voters, moral conservativism and their
   increased age are their main features. Finally, the Erdogan voter is
   culturally motivated rather than ethnically motivated and younger.},
