Title = {A Chip War Made in Germany? US Techno-Dependencies, China Chokepoints,
   and the German Semiconductor Industry},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {As geo-economic and geopolitical rivalries intensify, the US is
   weaponizing its power in global semiconductor supply chains to restrict
   Chinese technological development. To win this chip war against China,
   the US must compel key foreign firms in Asia and Europe not to supply
   its adversary with the materials, tools, and know-how needed to make
   advanced semiconductors. But will these firms agree to follow the US
   chip embargo and avoid the lucrative Chinese market? This article
   examines Germany's ``China chokepoint{''} firms, whose identity and
   behavior remain critically understudied. Drawing on novel data sets and
   annual company reports, we show that German firms across three case
   studies are highly ``techno-dependent{''} on the US. Despite this
   techno-dependence, German firms have so far sought to circumnavigate US
   export controls. This constitutes a puzzle because Germany's
   semiconductor firms are no more involved in the Chinese market than are
   firms in Japan and South Korea-which have frequently signaled voluntary
   compliance or even withdrawn from China in anticipation of harsher US
   sanctions. To resolve this puzzle, we map out Germany's semiconductor
   network and demonstrate that it is tightly articulated with Germany's
   auto industry-which is in turn heavily exposed to Chinese markets. We
   propose that this secondary exposure, through firms' embeddedness in
   Germany's ``national production regime,{''} encourages them to resist
   the US chip embargo. In this way, we contribute empirical and conceptual
   insights to international political economy scholarship on firms as
   geo-economic actors, actively engaged in a protracted and contentious
   policy process with US authorities.},

Abstract = {Given the importance that the issue of climate change has acquired in
   envi-ronmental policy, concerns are increasing about the effects of
   trade between nations of so-called ``Carbon Leakage{''}. The objective
   of this research is to examine the impact of US Foreign Direct
   Investment (FDI), Gross Domes-tic Product (GDP), trade openness (AC) and
   the consumption of renewable energy (RE), on carbon dioxide emissions
   (CO2) in Mexico during the period 1990 - 2019. For this, econometric
   tools were used. The main results show that the variables are of
   integration order I(1) and there is a long-term equili-brium
   relationship between the variables. Long-term models were estimated,
   demonstrating that there is a positive relationship between FDI, GDP and
   AC with CO2 emissions, so that an increase in FDI, GDP and AC
   contri-bute to the increase in CO2 emissions. And a negative
   relationship between RE consumption with CO2 emissions, so an increase
   in RE consumption will help reduce CO2 emissions. The results validate
   the Pollution Paradise Hypothesis because US FDI contributed to the
   increase in CO2 emissions, generating environmental degradation, turning
   Mexico into a pollution pa-radise country},

Title = {Left Behind Economically or Politically? Economic Grievances,
   Representation, and Populist Attitudes},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Research on the relationship between discontent and populist attitudes
   abounds. However, whether this discontent arises in response to economic
   grievances or a perceived lack of representation remains understudied.
   While previous research has considered both as independent factors, we
   assume their interaction drives populist attitudes. We argue that
   deprivation and sentiments of being left behind exacerbate the feeling
   that one's policy positions are not recognized and represented in
   politics. To test this claim empirically, we draw on recent data from
   the German Longitudinal Election Study of 2021. We combine egocentric
   and sociotropic indicators of being left behind and interact these with
   the perceived distance of one's own policy positions to the positions of
   the opposition and government parties represented in parliament. We find
   that both perceptions of personal and societal deprivation, as well as a
   greater perceived distance from the government, are associated with
   populist attitudes. Furthermore, we find that the effect of distance
   from the government is contingent on someone's economic position, albeit
   the direction of the interaction effect contradicts our initial
   expectations: The effect of perceived ideological distance from the
   government on populist attitudes is primarily reinforced among those who
   are better off rather than for those who struggle economically. This
   implies that populist attitudes ought to be addressed depending on the
   source of discontent rather than treating populism as a general
   expression of indiscriminate protest. Our analysis contributes to
   understanding the various origins of populist attitudes and to
   developing possible ways of mitigation.},

Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},

Abstract = {This paper describes two analytical categories that inform the set of
   behavioral rules and value precepts of agents in the Brazilian legal
   field, thus contributing to their operational ethics. The categories
   analyzed are the bricoleur and the disputatio mindset. Using Claude
   Levi-Strauss's approach to the bricoleur, the research explores how
   Brazilian legal agents decontextualize and recontextualize signs to
   create new and unique meanings, shaping the production of legal
   knowledge. The disputatio mindset is examined as a fundamental practice
   that regulates interactions and decisions within the legal field,
   highlighting the complexity and political dimension of judicial
   decisions.},

   ``case-based thinking{''}, the article sheds light on the changes in
   local educational policies based on associative uses, approached from
   the double angle of costs and (relative) profits derived from
   partnership involvement. Firstly, the article identifies the
   socio-professional and activist profiles of the associative workers
   involved in partnerships as well as the forms of professionalization
   ``in small steps{''} and ``in tension{''} reinforced by the
   rapprochement with the school and educational sphere. Secondly, the
   article identifies three types of ``partnership trials{''}. It thus
   sheds light on the structuring recompositions of public partnership
   action: by discreetly encouraging the processes of subcontracting and
   gratuity, commodification and flexibilisation of educational work, local
   educational policies embrace a neo-managerial approach to handling
   educational problems.},

Abstract = {In Russia, over 120 other languages from 11 language families are spoken
   alongside the state language, Russian. However, the majority of these
   languages are endangered or moribund. Even languages spoken by tens of
   thousands of people are being displaced by Russian and other major
   languages. Only a few languages, such as Tatar, Chechen, and Bashkir,
   are stable. With the extinction of each language, humanity loses part of
   its cultural heritage, which is preserved in stories, verses, epics, and
   creation myths that for the most part have been passed down orally.
   Specific ways of talking about the world and human experience are
   disappearing. This current linguistic overview gives an impression of
   the diversity of the Russian world of languages, but also of the
   dimension of the loss.},

   Media: Descriptive Analysis of the Echo Chamber Effect},
Journal = {SIYASAL-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The echo chamber effect is a phenomenon where people with similar ideas,
   beliefs, and manners intensify their ideas and thoughts with the
   pleasure of being approved, whereas people with opposing ideas and
   beliefs sink into silence. This is one of the biggest barriers to the
   development of a free and democratic environment for ideas and beliefs,
   and it is crucial for the democratic perspective on the freedom of
   expression on social media. This issue is a serious problem because the
   oppressive view and opinion environment strengthens practices that
   exclude diversity. This research aimed to descriptively examine tweets
   in terms of their significant hints provided through the creation of the
   echo chamber. The hashtag ``\#SUSyalMedyaYasas \& imath;{''}
   (\#Socialmedialaw)-related tweets were selected as the trending topics.
   Through descriptive analysis, this study also attempted to describe how
   the echo chamber concept affected and shaped the belief and idea posts
   on X. According to the analysis's findings, the new regulation on social
   media intensified the echo chamber effect by strengthening some
   predetermined attitudes and beliefs and weakening others by separating
   the legislation from its context and content.},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {This article addresses not only the family consequences but also the
   social and economic ones that take place after the divorce or separation
   of couples with children. The judicial sentences from the family courts
   in the Provincial Courts of the Autonomous Community of Galicia (Spain)
   between the years 2009 and 2020 have been reviewed, resulting in a total
   of 776 sentences. The analysis of custody reveals a persistent and
   traditional distribution of roles, in which the woman continues to be
   assumed as the primary caregiver of the children. Alimony constitutes
   one of the cornerstones of this process, with the payment predominantly
   falling on the father as the non-custodial parent. The results regarding
   alimony are particularly relevant, as a high percentage of the cases
   analyzed show a low amount of alimony awarded. The absence of a binding
   formula in our country for determining the amount of alimony does not
   facilitate the dignification of this primary responsibility and legal
   obligation of the non-custodial after or divorce.},

Title = {SECURITY MARKET IN AFRICA: THE PLACE OF RUSSIA AND NEW OPPORTUNITIES},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {4},
Pages = {23-37},
Abstract = {The article analyses the market of security services in Africa also
   examining the position which Russia holds in the current structure of
   supply and demand. Thus, a key goal is to determine the most promising
   directions within which Russian influence in terms of security provision
   can be widened. For this particular reason, the authors focus on supply
   and demand in the market of security services in Africa. In other words,
   the article consistently examines the main security challenges faced by
   regional governments and, at the same time, Russia's successful
   experience in the security provision in Africa. In order to provide for
   the structural examination of customers' preferences the authors
   highlight six groups of African states. Such a classification is based
   on the specific features, the severeness and the number of threats faced
   by the government and allows to study demand characteristics in details.
   At the same time the analysis of the Russian approach to cooperation
   with African states illustrates both advantages and disadvantages of the
   security services provided by Moscow. Suchwise, the key factors which
   predetermine the Kremlin's attractiveness as a security provider are the
   adherence to the three-noes concept, including non-interference in the
   internal affairs of security partners, readiness to find compromises and
   to adopt a realistic approach to goal-setting. Russia's successful
   experience in combatting rebels as well as the export of weapons are two
   components that also play an important role in the strategy adopted by
   Moscow. However current prospects are limited by the foreign pressure
   put on Russian allies in the region. As a result, the most promising
   direction to expand Russian influence in Africa in terms of security
   provision relates to the cooperation with the states that face a crisis
   affecting all the spheres of social life and that suffer from
   neo-colonial policies of former colonial powers. Moreover, it seems
   essential to develop forms and tools of military assistance for African
   security forces},

Abstract = {The objective of this proposal focuses on examining current capitalism
   and its tense relationship with democracy, proposing a socio-historical
   and political reflection on whether we should understand its latest
   transformation, and current economic liberalism, as one of the risks and
   significant challenges in the 21( st ). Two main ideas would support it.
   On the one hand, the political crisis of the last capitalism reflects
   the general crisis of Western culture, manifested in the growing
   political disaffection not unrelated to the collapse of the Welfare
   State and the era of Fordism, in a globalized context of
   proletarianization, deregulation, non -job and privatization. On the
   other hand, the main argument of this work attempts to examine the
   present time, emphasizing the changes and the social and political
   consequences of the latest capitalism, focussing the arguments in the
   unexpected characters forgotten by abundance, the middle class, now very
   distant from the bourgeois ideal (a crisis referred here as the shock of
   the gentle people). In fact, never have hear us democracy possible
   without that middle class and without Enlightenment bourgeois' ideal.},

Abstract = {The Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region is a remote and underdeveloped
   high mountain region in eastern Tajikistan. The Pamiri living there are
   Ismailis, unlike the Tajik majority population. After the civil war in
   the 1990s, the central government in Dushanbe tried several times to
   take control of Gorno-Badakhshan. But the local population supported the
   local authorities, and the precarious balance was always restored after
   violent escalations. Since May 2022, however, state forces have been
   cracking down on the Pamiri. The regime in Dushanbe is in the process of
   making the Pamiri people disappear.},

   THE QUALITY OF LIFE},
Journal = {REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE PENSAMIENTO POLITICO},
Year = {2024},
Number = {19},
Abstract = {The importance of environmental law and its relationship with civil law
   for the conservation and improvement of the environment as a human right
   to quality of life is highlighted in this paper. As a legal discipline,
   Enviromental Law promotes the effective protection of the human right to
   quality of life by regulating aspects such as the conservation of
   natural resources and liability for environmental damage. The right to a
   healthy environment is fully identified with the right to quality of
   life in its connection with human dignity. This implies considering the
   environment as a set of interrelated elements, such as natural resources
   and biodiversity, which must be conserved and protected to ensure a
   sustainable environment. Civil law plays a key role by establishing
   liability environmental damage and the reparation thereof, as well as
   regulating cessation of harmful activities and compensation to victims.
   Furthermore, essential to review existing legislation to strengthen
   these aspects and promote greater environmental protection through
   private law, including the possibility of collective actions and the
   clarification of prescription periods.},

Title = {Russia's Clashing Ambitions: Arctic Status Quo and World-Order Revision},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Moscow explicitly challenges what it depicts as a Western-led world
   order amid shifts in the global balance of power. However, while Russia
   has emerged as a fundamentally revisionist power in the global system,
   it has sought to maintain the status quo in Arctic regional governance,
   that is, to preserve the institutions and arrangements that have
   cemented its status as a great regional power on top of the world. This
   study, challenging the notions of Arctic exceptionalism and a distinct
   Arctic regional order, points out an obvious inconsistency in Russia's
   approach. It argues that Moscow's attempt at dismantling the world order
   while maintaining the status quo in the Arctic seems bound to fail
   simply because the current rules-based, liberal international order has
   also been the order of the Arctic. In conclusion, this study finds that
   Russia so far has been more successful in diminishing its own Arctic
   status and isolating itself from formal as well as informal arrangements
   than revising them.},

Abstract = {In this paper we seek to contribute to the study of the political party
   Vox, through an analysis of the identification process of its adherents
   and activists. Based on a series of in-depth interviews with Vox
   adherents, audiovisual records in social networks and observations of
   proselytising activities during the campaign for the governorship of the
   Community of Madrid between March and May 2021, we will scrutinise the
   social, political and phantasmatic logics articulated in the Voxite
   identification from an analytical perspective articulated by the
   Political Theory of Discourse and some elements of psychoanalysis
   (Glynos and Howarth, 2007). Based on the analysis of the three logics,
   we will argue that Vox's public message interpellates its adherents on
   concrete issues, promoting the claim of a full and free subject. This
   subject is threatened, on the one hand, by new social demands that
   challenge the conservative nationalist and traditional status quo, and
   frustrated, on the other hand, by the proliferation of economic and
   social inequalities. In this way, through this exploration of voxite
   identification, we aim to contribute to the vast existing bibliography
   on this political actor that highlights the importance of the collective
   identity that Vox constructs, or pretends to construct, as an
   explanatory factor for its relative rise on the Spanish scene. At the
   same time, through this specific case, we are interested in contributing
   to the debate on the transformations of contemporary ideological
   dynamics.},

Title = {The origins of Mexican violence (2007-2023)},
Journal = {REVISTA DE CIENCIA POLITICA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Starting from the decline in intentional homicide in Mexico during 2023,
   this article an-alyzes the roots of the violence crisis that has plagued
   the country for more than fifteen years. In particular, it seeks to
   answer the question of the factors, events, or conditions that triggered
   homicidal violence in Mexico starting in 2007. The article collects the
   main hy-potheses proposed on this issue and reviews their explanatory
   scope. These hypotheses are divided into three groups. The first
   consists of government actions that had unintended ef-fects. These
   include the deployment of military operations in various regions of the
   country starting in December 2006, the implementation of the kingpin
   strategy, which involves tar-geting and arresting high-level drug cartel
   leaders, and the tightening of drug interdiction mechanisms for drugs
   coming from South America. The second group consists of specific events
   related to the proximity to the United States. These include the
   increase in ex-con-victs deported from the United States, the rise in
   the number of firearms coming from the United States, and the increase
   in the price of cocaine. Finally, references are made to more structural
   conditions that preceded 2007. Specifically, political alternation and
   the crisis of local order manifested by the poor state of local police
   forces and long-term socio-economic explanations. To bring the
   discussion to the present moment, specifically to the year 2023, the
   last part of the text offers a reflection on the persistence of these
   factors and the future challenges that Mexico faces. This section
   focuses on two issues that are added to the topics reviewed in the first
   part of the article: the wave of migration that spread throughout 2023
   and the incursion of fentanyl into the national drug market, which was
   exacerbated in the years following the COVID-19 epidemic.},

Abstract = {The essay reconstructs the specificity of the algorithmic constellation
   that has established itself globally since 2001. It identifies platforms
   as asymmetric configurations of power that enable accumulation while
   operating a centralisation that allows for an original reconfiguration
   of the social. Through them, algorithms perform two specific political
   functions: the mediation between computational and cultural content and
   a command function that establishes the behaviour that digital
   individuals can and should engage in. Platforms are therefore not only a
   new form of enterprise, but also a political model that invests the
   state, which, by renouncing certain elements of its sovereignty,
   reaffirms its specific role within the algorithmic political form.},

Journal = {DESAFIOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},

Abstract = {When investigating social outbursts, the analysis tends to focus on
   social mobilization. Taking the case of the social outburst in Bolivia
   in 2019, this article instead explores the links between social
   movements and political parties, and their effect on electoral
   performance. Social movements played an important role in setting the
   scene for the outburst and in bringing the subsequent crisis to an end.
   Given their proximity in time, the 2019 and 2020 elections offer a
   singular opportunity to exam - ine the electoral effect of social
   movements -political parties links in the context of social outburst.
   The article analyses four connections between social movements and
   political parties: Movimiento al Socialismo, Comunidad Ciudadana,
   Bolivia dice No and Creemos. It identifies and explores the qualitative
   differences among the linkages built in these four cases, which range
   from organic party, movement party to circumstantial alliances. These
   are related to the dissimilar electoral results while considering the
   political scenario in which they operate. The analysis suggests that the
   linking of political parties with social movements and civil society
   organizations has become a condition for electoral success in Bolivia,
   in a scenario in which social protest constitutes a conventional channel
   for political participation and articulation of citizen demands},

Abstract = {The article compares the reckless socio-political dynamics in Russia in
   the 1990s, manifested in a series of crises and turning events, with the
   concept of mechanisms of the Russian historical cycles. The paper lists
   the main stages of dynamics - complexes of interrelated events that
   change he balance of power, structural conditions and the direction of
   subsequent processes. The author also lists the main actors and social
   groups involved in the political dynamics of that time period: supreme
   power, reformers, insiders, oligarchs, representatives of special
   services, ``pro-soviet{''} and democratic opposition, urban educated
   class, workers and miners' movements,{''}ordinary people{''}. The author
   concludes that the rapid sweeping changes in the politics of the 1990s
   took place, as they did before, in the parametric space with the axes of
   ``state success{''} and ``freedom{''}. Transitions occurred between the
   phases that were typical for much longer cycles of the Russian
   historical past - ``crisis{''}, ``liberalization{''}, ``authoritarian
   rollback{''}, ``state collapse{''}, ``military-political triumph{''}. At
   the same time, the mechanism of the general democratic backsliding trend
   and the growth of authoritarian tendencies calls for clarification. The
   authors propose a phase model that explains this change through the
   patterns of response strategies of the supreme power to challenges and
   threats under different conditions. Weakness and failures of the state
   policy coupled with a shortage of resources led to mass disillusionment,
   delegitimization of the supreme power and reform policy, which
   manifested itself in elections and inspired the adherents of the
   restoration. The increase in the corresponding threats placed a premium
   on administrative and violent measures. Once sufficient resources were
   accumulated, those measures were becoming successful and received
   positive reinforcement. With each crisis, the supreme power took an
   upper hand, while the collegial separation of powers was reduced, and
   the reforms lost their original focus on economic freedom, the rise of
   small and medium-sized businesses, and the growth of democracy. As a
   result, the opportunities for the political modernization were missed,
   giving way to the authoritarian trends.},

   Development, his critique of neoliberal economic dogmatism and its
   language, particularly parameters like Gross Domestic Product and the
   principle of economic growth. It also examines the proposition of
   barefoot economics and its redefinition of needs, among other related
   aspects. Similarly, it advocates for the need for a vital endogenous
   development that allows the articulation of the local and the national,
   the particular and the universal, facilitating the construction of a
   more comprehensive and environmentally respectful economic model. Over
   four years after his death, this text aims to serve as a call to review
   his work and appreciate his contributions, which fall within the realm
   of Latin American critical and alternative thought as a decolonial
   alternative.},

Abstract = {Almost a year after the expulsion of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh,
   Armenia is still under massive pressure. The violent end to the conflict
   over the exclave may well have increased the possibility of a settlement
   with Azerbaijan. The government of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan is
   seeking such a compromise. But the autocratic regime in Baku continues
   to act aggressively and is constantly putting forward new demands. Even
   if it comes to a compromise, there is no one to guarantee the agreement.
   The former security guarantor Russia is having a destabilising effect,
   the EU is paralysed and toothless, and the United States is acting with
   restraint. The desperate situation is leading to social tensions. A
   protest movement has formed against the government. The fears of the
   protest movement are justified, it has no solutions, and radical slogans
   worsen the situation.},

Title = {NATIONAL SCHOOLS OF DIPLOMATIC TRAINING: DIVERGENCES IN THE GLOBAL
   EPISTEMOLOGY OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},

Pages = {121-135},
Abstract = {The proposition of establishing ``global international relations{''}
   (Global IR) as an amalgamation of diverse national epistemologies in the
   field of international relations, potentially superseding the
   Western-centric paradigm, presents significant challenges. A critical
   inquiry emerges: Is it possible to form a discipline based on the
   polyphony of national approaches, despite the fact that the ontology of
   international relations has remained fundamentally unchanged since the
   mid-17th century? This study evaluates the thesis of extant national
   epistemologies in international relations by examining national
   traditions of diplomatic training. The primary research question is
   formulated as follows: What are the foundational approaches employed by
   leading states in the training of IR specialists, and can these
   approaches be considered reflective of national epistemologies regarding
   the nature of international relations? The research methodology involves
   a synthesis of findings from an examination of diplomatic training
   institutions across a diverse sample of countries. This sample
   encompasses Western nations (United Kingdom, Hungary, Poland, United
   States, Finland, France, and Germany), Asian countries (Vietnam,
   Indonesia, India, China, and the Republic of Korea), Middle Eastern
   states (Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey), African nations (Nigeria
   and South Africa), and Latin American countries (Brazil, Mexico, and
   Cuba). The article is structured in two principal sections. The
   theoretical section explores the hypothesis of ``global international
   relations{''} within the context of existing literature and theoretical
   frameworks. The second section synthesizes the empirical findings from
   the study of national approaches to diplomatic training, testing the
   hypothesis of its correlation with national epistemologies in the field
   of international relations.},

Abstract = {This article explores the level of digital competence of young people in
   Poland, with the indirect aim being to show the differences in the level
   of digital competence for adolescents living in rural and urban areas.
   The research covered a sample of 985 respondents, from 11-18 years old,
   from Poland. The research was carried out within the EU Kids Online
   network. The survey tool related to the assessment of digital
   competences covered issues of installation of software on mobile
   devices, configuration of internet access as pertains to confidential
   information, information security awareness, management of information
   downloaded from the internet, configuration of social networks, e
   -shopping, verification of costs related to the use of additional
   software, advanced information search, checking the reliability of
   information, and editing online content. Descriptive statistics, k
   -means cluster analysis, one-way analysis of variance (non -parametric
   test), and correlations were used to show the differences between rural
   and urban adolescents in the indicated areas. The collected data offer
   several postulates for education and education policy, being not only
   diagnostic but also implementational. Based on the analysis of the data,
   it was noted that: (a) Eleven areas related to basic digital competence
   strongly differentiate between urban and rural young people; (b) rural
   young people rate their own digital competence lower than urban young
   people do; (c) a small percentage of young people from both rural and
   urban areas have low digital competence; (d) one well -developed area of
   key competence does not always co-occur with another well -developed
   area; and (e) the style of using new media among rural and urban young
   people is similar.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this work is to show the change in migratory flows that
   occurred in some countries in the South American region with respect to
   Venezuelan migration. For this, two types of analysis were carried out;
   firstly, a documentary on the measures adopted in immigration matters;
   and, secondly, semi-structured interviews with fifty-five Venezuelans
   returning from seven different countries. Among the main results, it is
   evidentthatfrom several South American countries there is a tendency for
   Venezuelan migrants to return to their country. This return has occurred
   in two modalities: the assisted voluntary return through the Vuelta a la
   Patria Plan, and the unassisted voluntary return, the latter being the
   largest.},

Abstract = {This study analyses T \& uuml;rkiye's policy towards Syrian asylum
   seekers in light of the normative power of the European Union (EU) and
   Carl Schmitt's critique of liberal democracy. The article hypothesises
   that T \& uuml;rkiye, under the influence of the EU's normative power,
   prioritised the collectivist discourse in its Syrian asylum seeker
   policy, pushing universal principles to the background, and finally
   politicising and bringing them to the bargaining process. This
   hypothesis was tested, using a qualitative research design, with
   semi-structured interviews conducted with officials from the T \&
   uuml;rkiye Red Crescent (TRCO), the Presidency of Migration Management
   Officer (PMMO), and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of T
   \& uuml;rkiye (MFAO). Furthermore, data was collected through a
   quantitative survey with non-random sampling from 390 Turkish citizens
   who were affected by these policies, residing in the Istanbul/Fatih,
   Mersin/Mezitli, and Kilis city centres, to determine their perceptions.
   The data shows that Schmitt's concerns about liberal democracy are
   reflected in EUoriented T \& uuml;rkiye's asylum seeker policies. The
   conflict between the legal texts covering universal human rights and the
   national interests of EU Members and T \& uuml;rkiye should only be
   resolved by harmonized universal principles and collectivist consent.},

Title = {INCORPORATING EQUITABLE CARBON ACCESS INTO CARBON TAXES},
Journal = {REVISTA DE CIENCIA POLITICA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {As climate change mitigation measures, carbon taxes ought to assign the
   burdens associated with decarbonization equitably and should at least
   aim to avoid perpetuating wide inequities in carbon access. While
   several popular carbon taxation schemes incorporate ``feebate{''} or
   other redistribute adjustments designed to offset the regressive impacts
   of rising energy costs, seeking to neutralize the burden-sharing
   inequity of such policies, they can also contribute to inequities in
   carbon access, which constitute a second kind of inequity that
   offsetting schemes may not neutralize. Attention to resource-sharing
   principles that capture this latter equity objective suggests a
   comparison between downstream rationing schemes that allocate carbon
   access among persons and at the point of consumption, thereby
   instantiating resource-sharing equity, and the carbon pricing schemes
   that require extensive modifications in order to approximate such equity
   ideals. In this paper, I compare the two for purposes of focusing on
   this neglected second equity concern in the design of carbon pricing
   schemes like carbon taxes as well as on incorporating other
   justice-related advantages of downstream rationing into such a scheme.},

Abstract = {Reggae and dancehall represent popular taste in Jamaica. Black
   nationalist discourses advocate that authentic Jamaican music be tied to
   the experiences of poor Blacks and local resistances to Western
   imperialism. Unfortunately, the local rock music scene's affinity for
   `foreign' music styles kept the community on the fringes of the music
   industry. To secure distinction, rock musicians reimagined and imitated
   `ideal' Black tropes in conceptualizing lyrics and their family tree,
   villainizing Whiteness and justifying their taste. This paper outlines
   the complexities of Black taste in Jamaica to highlight the barriers
   Black nationalism has engineered in the production of local music.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {China has sustained double-digit economic growth over three decades. A
   literature has emerged with one possible explanation: meritocratic
   promotion, where officials at the same level compete with each other on
   the basis of relative GDP growth, and the winners are rewarded with
   promotion up the administrative hierarchy. This tournament competition
   generates strong incentives for politicians to boost growth. I reanalyze
   this literature, focusing on prefecture-level leaders. I select three
   papers that study different research questions, but each reports
   secondary results on meritocratic promotion of prefecture leaders.
   Reanalyzing these results, I find that the evidence is not robust to
   alternative control variables, regression specifications, or outcome
   variables. Overall, I provide an example of a literature seeming to
   converge on a finding, but where each piece of evidence is unreliable.},

Title = {THE HISTORY OF POST-SOVIET ARMENIA THROUGH ITS POLITICAL MYTHS AND
   SYMBOLS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {5},
Pages = {82-101},
Abstract = {We address the semiotics of conceptual shifts in the dominant discursive
   political and sociocultural practices of the Post-Soviet Armenia. The
   political history of independent Armenia is expressed through dominant
   political symbols and concepts, with a heterogeneous mixture of
   mythologized ancient history, Soviet and anti-Soviet ideologies.
   Attempts to create new symbols or re-interpret old ones led to
   significant transformations in the main discursive practices, which
   could form the foundation for the legitimization of the Armenian
   political identity. In general, if we depart from the substantive
   aspects, semiotic operations are governed by two main transformational
   principles: recursion and inversion, precisely those that Levi-Strauss
   described in relation to myth. At the same time, different cycles of
   this process can coexist in the same socio-cultural space. The political
   post-Soviet history of Armenia is divided into four periods, each of
   which is associated with a specific political regime (1990 - 1998; 1998
   - 2018; 2018 - 2020; 2020 - up to present). Each of them gives rise to
   different political myths, both dominant (official) and oppositional,
   but in general, they are all based on the basic vocabulary that was
   formed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Therefore, from the point of
   view of symbolic conceptual patterns, they are all based on the
   transformation (negation, inversion, and recursion) of the previous
   stages. Thus, the initial stage was characterized by a revaluation of
   values: everything Soviet was to be denied, and the Republic of Armenia
   of 1918-1920 was considered as a model. However, the new authorities
   intended to establish themselves through the myth of the creation of a
   fundamentally new - namely, a political nation, therefore, a tension has
   emerged between the concepts of reincarnation and creation. Soviet
   Armenia is contrasted with non-Soviet Armenia, which is then split into
   two opposed concepts: the First vs. the Third Republic. Then their
   ``reconciliation{''} took place. It is reflected in the metanarrative of
   the Three Republics, and the Soviet Armenia occupies a worthy place as
   an intermediate link from incomplete to full-fledged independent
   statehood. In the 1900s, primordial narratives were revived, asserting
   the immutability of Armenia, starting with the legendary progenitor
   Hayk. At present, there is an obvious attempt to create the concept of
   the ``Fourth Republic{''} based on the negation of the previous ones, up
   to the rejection of the Declaration of Independence as a Soviet legacy
   and the annulment of previous symbols (the coat of arms, the anthem, the
   Mount Ararat)},

Abstract = {To achieve foreign policy goals and boost prestige, states try to
   influence how foreign publics perceive them. Particularly during crises,
   the imperative to mitigate a negative image may see states mobilize
   resources to change the global narrative. This paper investigates
   whether China's `mask diplomacy' efforts influenced portrayals of the
   country in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. We validate and
   apply a semi-supervised scaling method to 1.5 million English statements
   in newspapers around the world mentioning China and Covid-19.
   Multi-period difference-in-differences models reveal that media tone
   improved significantly after mask diplomacy engagement. Using its
   Covid-19 White Paper to determine China's preferred external narratives,
   we also find that a country's domestic media reproduced key terms more
   after the country received PRC support.},

Title = {What do we mean when we talk about constituency service? A scoping
   literature review of four decades of research},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},

Abstract = {Constituency service is a crucial concept for understanding the nature
   and intensity of the links between representatives and their
   constituents. However, studies have been inconsistent about the meaning
   of constituency service, its causes and consequences, justifying a
   systematic analysis of where we stand in this field of studies. This
   article conducts a scoping literature review of 198 studies on
   constituency service published between 1975 and 2021. It aims to answer
   the following questions: how has constituency service been defined?
   Which research designs are commonly used when studying it? And what are
   its driving factors and political effects? These questions are answered
   using a dataset that codes each study along several dimensions tapping
   into conceptualization, research design, explanatory factors, and
   effects. The analysis shows that this field of research has grown
   significantly over the last decade, covering more activities (inside and
   outside the geographic constituency) and countries, with increased
   methodological pluralism. This review makes an original contribution by
   charting the main trends in the study of constituency service, advancing
   a dynamic conceptualization of constituency service, and opening up new
   avenues for research on the subject.},

Abstract = {This article examines how bulk interception regimes are legitimized in
   parliamentary proceedings, and more broadly, explores how illiberal
   security policy is produced in digitalized, democratic states. Focusing
   on the Norwegian case, the study finds that proponents of the bulk
   interception bill successfully legitimized its passing through four
   interrelated discursive strategies: establishing bulk interception as a
   liberty/security-problem, lowering the liberty-stakes, raising the
   security stakes and representing digitalization as a threat multiplier
   and as a threat in itself. The findings indicate that digital threats
   enable the combination of exceptional and diffuse securitization, which
   legitimizes the expedient processing and at the same time permanent
   validity of new intelligence legislation.},

Abstract = {Whereas the existing literature on political Islam has often examined
   post-Islamism in relation to political and economic liberalism, this
   intervention foregrounds a variety of post-Islamism that is decidedly
   Leftist in its political and economic commitments. In so doing, the
   present article moves away from a conception of post-Islamism as a
   monolithic project. Instead, the article uses the term in relation to a
   plurality of conditions and projects in and by which some Muslim
   individuals and groups, having become disenchanted with the project of
   establishing an Islamic political order (nizam Islami) as an instrument
   for the implementation of Islamic law (sharia), continue to draw on
   their religious faith in order to advance a range of competing - at
   times clashing - political projects and socioeconomic agendas. By
   focusing on examples from Turkey and Iran, the article provides an
   alternative to the hitherto existing conception of post-Islamism as a
   project with a predominantly neoliberal economic orientation and an
   ambivalent position on democratic politics. It argues that the
   post-Islamist Muslim Left in Turkey and Iran has contributed to the
   articulation in these countries of a democratic and socialist conception
   of Islamic public religiosity.},

Title = {Charivari 2.0: The Striking Resurgence of an Old Contentious Tactic},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 16},
Abstract = {In recent years, an old contentious tactic in which protesters besiege
   and harass public officials in their private homes has
   resurged.Discontented sectors of all stripes have employed what is most
   commonly called charivari or{''}rough music.{''}To elucidate
   thissurprising reappearance, this reflection highlights the rise of
   conflict over cultural and moral values, affective polarization, and
   thepersonalization of politics. Moreover, the proliferation of social
   media has eroded the boundary between the public and privatesphere and
   thus propelled the resurgence of privacy-breaching direct action. This
   interpretive essay compares the special features ofrevived charivari
   with its earlier incarnations in premodern times and in the revolutions
   of the long nineteenth century, and with theinternet harassment of the
   twenty-first century. By analyzing the reappearance of a contentious
   tactic with premodern roots, thisessay seeks to shed light on broader
   trends of sociopolitical development in the postmodern age.},

Abstract = {On December 17, 2023, another cycle of extraordinary parliamentary
   elections was held in Serbia, this time simultaneously with early
   provincial elections in the northern autonomous province of Vojvodina
   and early local elections in over 60 cities and municipalities.
   Elections for nearly 90 other cities and municipalities in the country
   have been conducted 6 months later, in June 2024, coinciding with the
   expiration of local assembly mandates. Both votes were preceded by
   political crises; however, as with all elections since 2014, they
   resulted in a decisive victory for the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).
   In this paper, we will present an overall framework of the elections,
   including electoral rules, main actors and their campaign strategies,
   and results. Additionally, we will employ theoretical concepts of hybrid
   regime, stabilitocracy, and nationalization of elections to explain the
   frequent extraordinary elections in Serbia and their outcomes.},

Title = {Rethinking the imperative mandate: Toward a better balance between
   independence and accountability},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 14},
Abstract = {Two of the founding principles of representative governments-the
   independence of elected representatives and popular accountability-are
   notoriously in tension. The more independent representatives are, the
   less citizens can exercise control over them. This article defends an
   institutional proposal-semi-directed mandates-aiming to capture the main
   concerns of both advocates and critics of imperative mandates and to
   strike a better balance between independence and accountability than the
   one usually prevailing in contemporary representative governments. The
   proposal consists of (i) asking candidates or parties to put forward key
   priorities before the election; (ii) allowing voters to give a more
   specific mandate to their representatives, and (iii) allowing them to
   revoke the mandate in case of betrayal of key promises unless they can
   offer convincing justifications for departing from their mandate. More
   flexible than the traditional imperative mandate, this proposal also
   preserves the benefits of a partial division of political labor. It,
   therefore, seems better suited to the typical circumstances of mass
   democracies.},

Abstract = {Do social influencers affect election outcomes? Social influencers can
   reach millions of people through social media platforms such as
   Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. However, research on social
   influencers is scarce and it is unclear whether they can affect
   elections. I argue that social influencers can influence elections
   through their role as digital opinion leaders and their power to shape
   the public agenda. Empirically, this study leverages an event that
   occurred during the 2019 European election campaign. Eight days before
   the 2019 EP election, the social influencer Rezo published a video in
   which he severely attacks the christian democratic CDU/CSU which was
   watched by over 11.5 million users until the election. Based on a
   differences-in-differences design, it is shown that the video had a
   sizeable effect on the election resulting in considerable vote losses
   for the CDU/CSU. The results are important for the debate on electoral
   competition and social media.},

Abstract = {Scholars have shown that activists use the Internet for political
   purposes more often than passive rank-and-file members. Previous
   research indicates activists engage in different types of activities and
   with various levels of intensity. However, it is unclear to what extent
   such modes of party activism are linked to different uses of digital
   resources. Our paper contributes to the existing research by explaining
   what drives party website usage as an informational tool among different
   groups of party activists. Building on survey data from delegates
   attending party conferences between 2008 and 2017 in Spain, we test
   three main organisational drivers of party website use: the modes of
   internal activism, holding party offices, and ideological congruence.
   Our results confirm that those activists engaging in a wider range of
   activities, holding a party office, and being more ideologically
   congruent with their parties are more likely to use the party website
   frequently than the rest.},

Abstract = {Intergenerational transmission of culture and language across Native
   American communities in the United States has been obstructed by more
   than 520 years of sustained cultural genocide and attempts of linguicide
   which, in turn, inflicted intergenerational trauma that still impacts
   Native American communities today. This article intentionally bridges
   understandings of language revitalization efforts in a North American
   Ojibwe community employing Indigenous research methods. The community
   efforts are reflected upon by an Ojibwe Elder and longtime language
   teacher, which is then responded to by two colleagues and friends of the
   Elder who come from a Western perspective. This ``two-eyed{''} approach
   illustrates the importance of Indigenization in education and
   communities as a process of truth, reconciliation, and healing after
   genocide. Once the historical context is given, the Elder's reflections
   of language revitalization are understood through mapping the Medicine
   Wheel and as having mental, spiritual, emotional, and physical impacts.
   Further, the work of the community to reclaim and recenter the schools
   and community to the Ojibwe worldview is viewed as weaving together the
   Seven Grandfather Teachings of Love, Respect, Honesty, Truth, Wisdom,
   Humility, and Bravery as acts of resistance to continued actions of the
   dominant US culture that degrade and dishonor Native American nations
   and communities.},

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 2},
Abstract = {An unresolved aspect of women's underrepresentation in politics is the
   media portrayal of female candi-dates. This paper studies how advocacy
   campaigns may affect potential bias, leveraging the 2019 Swissfederal
   elections, which were shaped by two nation-wide, cross-party campaigns
   advocating for genderequality. The empirical analysis compares the 2015
   and 2019 election campaigns, relying on an originaldataset of the
   mentions that all candidates (over 3,700 respectively 4,600) received in
   over 2.2 million newsarticles. The analysis produces three main results.
   First, although in both elections male candidatesreceived more media
   attention than female candidates did, the gender gap was significantly
   smaller in2019 than in 2015. Second, in both elections, male and female
   candidates tended to be mentioned in con-junction with
   gender-stereotypical topics. Third, the gender gap in media attention
   before and after a keywomen's rights event was similar to that between
   the corresponding periods in 2015. These findings sug-gest that the
   differences observed between 2015 and 2019 are linked to the political
   campaign at largerather than to a specific event, despite its historical
   dimensions. The results contribute to the understand-ing of how advocacy
   campaigns can change bias in media coverage and, methodologically, to
   measuringand understanding gendered media coverage of politics.},

Abstract = {How can we ensure that global public institutions such as those
   associated with the United Nations will address the pressing global
   problems of our time without committing abuses of power? In
   republicanism, participation by citizens is the primary condition for
   the protection of liberty. In particular, citizens are expected to be
   vigilant-to maintain awareness of and protest domination when and where
   it occurs. Global republican scholars such as James Bohman (2007) have
   been sensitive to this demanding ideal of citizenship. However, the
   grounds and mechanisms for fostering allegiance to the state-such as a
   joint history or language, public education, and the practice of joint
   participation in political decision making-are still largely absent at
   the global level, and this has implications for the robustness of
   non-dominating global public institutions. This article considers
   whether and how globally vigilant citizenship may be encouraged or
   cultivated in the short- to medium-term.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the main defense activities between China and Russia
   since 2014 that led to the growing ties between Chinese and Russian
   militaries, manifested by increasing arms trade, technology transfer,
   and bilateral military exercises. Closer cooperation has resulted in
   deeper integration of the two armies into a common defense space, paving
   the way for a quasi-military union between Russia and China in the
   future, as the two countries' threat perceptions have worsened. Their
   continued military and defense collaboration and shared interests in a
   less-American order will have far-reaching implications for the security
   architectures in both Asia-Pacific and Eastern Europe.},

Abstract = {H \& eacute;l \& egrave;ne Landemore's Open Democracy (2020) offers both
   a normative conception of popular rule and an institutional schema
   intended to advance it. This schema is grounded in a normative
   conception of popular rule that associates democracy with the values of
   inclusion and equality. But this association misses a historically
   important dimension of popular rule- popular sovereignty-which requires
   the people as a whole to play a critical part in decision making.
   Landemore's dismissal of popular sovereignty informs her institutional
   schema, which relies upon both sortition and self-selection. It leaves
   no significant room for the people as a whole to act, either directly
   (via referenda) or indirectly (via election). Landemore never explicitly
   defends this dismissal of popular sovereignty from her conception of
   popular rule. Given the historical importance of this dimension of
   popular rule, and its continuing intuitive appeal, any such dismissal
   requires careful justification.},

Title = {Populism and the rule of law: The importance of institutional legacies},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 29},
Abstract = {Existing work sees populist governments undermining the rule of law
   because they seek to dismantle institutional constraints on their
   personalistic plebiscitarian rule. We argue that populist rulers pose a
   greater threat to legal impartiality, equality, and compliance when they
   face a legacy of weak rule of law. We find empirical support for this
   assertion after applying synthetic control methods to a cross-country
   sample that includes up to 51 populist events spanning the period from
   1920 to 2019. Our results remain consistent across a range of robustness
   checks including, the consideration of a set of contextual variables
   that can potentially determine the capacity of populist governments to
   sweep away institutional constraints, different populist event
   classifications, and different ways of measuring the rule of law. In
   countries, like the United States, with a robust rule of law tradition,
   the deleterious impact of populists on institutions will be limited but
   not negligible.},

Abstract = {Politicians, activists, and the rich themselves variously describe rich
   people as hard workers, greedy tax avoiders, generous philanthropists,
   and more. Occasionally, such descriptions are wielded in attempts to
   legitimize or delegitimize high income taxes on the rich. However, we do
   not have a good understanding of which of these appeals are most
   successful. This article explores which attributes of the rich affect
   support for progressive taxation. First, I use an inductive approach to
   derive relevant attributes from open-ended survey responses and prior
   literature. Then, pre-registered experiments in the United States and
   Denmark show that when the rich exhibit pro-social behaviors (e.g.,
   treating workers well, not using tax loopholes), this reduces public
   support for taxing them. In comparison, indicators of merit (e.g.,
   working hard) are of secondary or even insignificant importance. I
   conclude that in redistributive politics, the perceived pro-social
   behavior of the rich is a key consideration for the public.},

Abstract = {Despite the proliferation of rooftop solar in the United States, its
   deployment and associated benefits have not been distributed equitably.
   Many states have adopted targeted incentives to improve access to
   rooftop solar and increase its uptake among low- and moderate-income
   (LMI) communities. This article examines the policy feedback effects of
   energy efficiency policies and electricity-sector portfolio standards on
   the adoption and diffusion of LMI solar incentives across states. Event
   History Analyses indicate that between 2010 and 2019, the adoption and
   diffusion of the incentives have been conditional on a state's portfolio
   standards but independent of energy efficiency policies. Feedback
   effects from the portfolio standards in neighboring states are found to
   have a regressive impact on the likelihood of adoption. Hence, the
   feedback effects of previously adopted renewable energy policies are
   helping states to better serve vulnerable communities. However, there is
   no evidence of geographic clustering in the diffusion of incentives.},

Abstract = {In the field of American state politics, the tension between
   majoritarian institutions and equality has largely been ignored. Do
   state institutions that empower majority preferences exacerbate
   disparities in social outcomes? Under what conditions do majoritarian
   institutions exacerbate inequalities in the American states? Our
   argument is that equality is most likely to be threatened under
   majoritarian institutions when (1) there are systemic participatory
   biases and/or (2) there are widespread prejudices about particular
   groups in society. We find that more majoritarian institutions are
   associated with larger disparities between White and Black life
   expectancy and poverty rates across the American states, but not
   differences in educational attainment. We also find that this effect is
   moderated by racial context, with majoritarian institutions being
   associated with greater disparities for states with diverse racial
   contexts and smaller disparities in more homogenous states. These
   findings suggest that majoritarian institutions operate to the benefit
   of the White majority, while coming at the cost of minority population
   outcomes when a racial threat is perceived, and presumably, public
   opinion is biased.},

Abstract = {Governments use a variety of tools to discourage, impede, or limit the
   ability of foreign adversaries to purse their ambitions. Some of these
   measures seek to constrain an opponent's capacity, while others seek to
   deter an opponent to take (or not) a particular action. We develop a
   theory to study how constraining and coercive threats interact
   strategically. Building on canonical models of deterrence, we first
   identify how coercive measures, in isolation, curb an aggressor's
   transgressions. We then identify when constraining measures and the
   threat of coercion (deterrence) are substitutes and when they are
   complements. In some cases, constraining measures make deterrence
   effective when it would otherwise fail (constraining to deter). Our
   results offer insights about measuring the effectiveness of various
   diplomatic tools. We highlight a series of novel empirical challenges
   stemming from the interaction of selection effects and ecological
   features of a sample of country dyads, and discuss potential solutions.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the emergent scholarship on European Union
   (EU) external differentiated integration (EDI). Zooming in on aviation
   and trade, two of the most salient sectors of cooperation in the EU's
   European Neighbourhood Policy, it examines why EDI with EU southern
   neighbours emerged in aviation, but not in trade despite high degrees of
   interdependence. Adopting an outside-in perspective to the study of EDI
   that treats EU southern neighbours as units of analysis, this article
   applies three logics revolving around economic, identity and regime
   security considerations. It argues that it was either individual logics
   or a convergence of all three logics, together with variegated domestic
   scope conditions, that explain why EU southern neighbours committed to
   rule-taking in aviation but rejected EU regulatory extension in trade.},

Abstract = {As more laws emerge in the EU's member states that regulate lobbying,
   this growing trend also warrants a closer look at how lobbying
   regulation at EU level has evolved, not least since some of the new
   lobbying registers have looked to the EU's system for inspiration. The
   European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European
   Commission signed an inter-institutional agreement on a mandatory
   transparency register on 20 May 2021 (OJ L 207, 11.6.2021, p. 1-17) with
   an accompanying political statement (OJ L 207, 11.6.2021, p. 18-18),
   effectively making prior registration a condition for certain interest
   representation activities. Since the Parliament and the Commission first
   joined forces in their efforts to shed light on interest representation,
   advocacy and all other types of lobbying in 2011, their goal has not
   changed fundamentally. However, the appetite for transparent
   decision-making and accountability both on the side of the
   decision-makers and on the public scrutiny side has grown alongside
   wider efforts to ensure the resilience of democratic structures and
   processes in uncertain times. In this context, this paper examines what
   the EU institutions' transparency register can and cannot do, how the
   EU's institutions achieve compliance with their carrot and stick
   approach and how the new conditionality principle introduced in 2021
   makes registration de facto mandatory for interest representatives
   seeking to influence policy and decision-making of the Parliament, the
   Council and the Commission.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses Italian party positions on the EU's response to the
   Russo-Ukrainian war, singling out the adoption of sanctions against
   Russia, the provision of military support to Kiev, enlargement to
   Ukraine and the welcoming of Ukrainian refugees into the Union's
   territory as the four main dimension of such a response. The paper draws
   on the literatures on cleavage politics, the inverted U curve and the
   differentiated forms of politicisation, thereby testing theory-driven
   research hypotheses through a qualitative content analysis of Italian
   parties' Facebook posts in the three months following the outbreak of
   the conflict, combining an inductive and a deductive approach. The
   findings show that party families are a good explanatory factor behind
   Italian party positions vis-\& agrave;-vis the EU's response to the war
   outbreak as parties belonging to the same family shared a similar stance
   on the four dimensions of such a response. On the contrary, the
   Europeanism/Euroscepticism divide does not explain Italian party
   positions on the EU's reaction to the Ukrainian conflict as Europeanist
   parties split over the EU's provision of weapons to Ukraine about as
   much as Eurosceptic partis split over the adoption of sanctions against
   Moscow. Finally, the paper shows that policy issues in the EU's response
   to the war (such as sanctions and arms delivery) were much more salient
   for and contested by Italian political parties than constitutive issues
   (such as enlargement and asylum).},

Title = {Death dealers: Dynamics of Israel's permanent war economy},
Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 8},
Abstract = {This study critically explores Israel's permanent war economy, examining
   its core principles and strategic impacts. It analyzes how the war
   economy is integral to Israel's settler-colonial structures and
   functions, fulfilling various ideological, geopolitical, and financial
   goals through a sustained conflict footing, rather than being a
   transient occurrence. To this end, the study identifies and analyzes
   four key dynamics underpinning Israel's war economy: First, acute
   societal militarism serves as an economic growth engine, nurturing
   skilled military capital and advanced technologies that feed the war
   economy system. Second, the role of American patronage is examined as a
   key enabler of the Israeli war economy. In the absence of a traditional
   colonial metropole, the United States functions as an imperial sponsor,
   providing extensive military aid, technological transfers, financial
   assistance, and diplomatic backing-without which Israel's military
   posture would be inconceivable. Third, the article investigates Israel's
   exploitation of the occupied Palestinian territories as a laboratory for
   testing, optimizing and marketing military systems' performance to
   international clients. Fourth, examines how Israel's arms export
   multiplies revenues for the Israeli war economy while also providing
   diplomatic leverage to advance Israel's geopolitical agendas and foreign
   policy objectives.},

   Armed Conflict and Mass Atrocity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 7},
Abstract = {In many jurisdictions, the criminal responsibility of adults is
   demarcated from pre-adults (adolescents, pre-adolescents, and children)
   based on a threshold criterion - one is either an adult or a pre-adult,
   and different levels of responsibility are accordingly inferred and
   imputed. But in a world where complexity is growingly acknowledged, and
   by that token, nuance and variety, there has been a predilection for the
   spectrum over the binary - or the scalar over the threshold. In the
   context of juvenile justice, this has manifested in a move away from the
   binary demarcation between adults and pre-adults through a growing faith
   in brain developmental science, which in turn, focuses on the
   developmental stages of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In pre-adults,
   especially in adolescents, immature PFCs account for impulsiveness,
   volatility, and influence by peers, which in turn impact judgment and
   decision-making. These findings have been introduced in a few state and
   federal US courts trying juveniles, and recently, in the ICC trial and
   appeal of Dominic Ongwen, a child soldier. This paper assesses the
   nature, scope, and treatment of neuroscientific evidence, and lays down
   guidelines about its anticipated application in international trials
   involving vulnerable perpetrators such as juveniles.},

   Discourse in the Face of the Russia-Ukraine War},

Abstract = {The initial response of the European Union (EU) to people fleeing
   Ukraine was unusually univocal and welcoming, culminating in the swift
   activation of the Temporary Protection Directive. This predominantly
   humanitarian response represents a special case and an outlier in terms
   of how the EU and its member states have responded to previous
   displacements. This paper explores the discursive construction that made
   this response possible, by looking at how forced migration from Ukraine
   has been characterised in the EUropean political discourses. Drawing on
   discourse theory and critical migration studies, we assume that the
   discourse is marked by differences drawn along the lines of ``race,{''}
   ``gender,{''} and ``distance,{''} which are linked to ideas about
   national identity and European values. In order to reflect the
   multilevel European discourse, we reconstruct the political discourse on
   the EU level as well as in two diverse cases, Poland and Germany. Our
   findings suggest that despite national differences and the presence of
   well-established tropes of deservingness, the EUropean discourse is not
   only based on ideas surrounding vulnerability of the Ukrainian Other and
   the European Self but is also influenced by the perception of the
   threatening Russian Other. Especially in Poland, welcoming refugees from
   Ukraine is linked to security concerns, while the EU and German
   discourses stress the role of European values and solidarity. Thus, the
   acceptance of Ukrainian refugees should be seen as part of the overall
   European response to Russian aggression and not as a departure from its
   previous stance on migration.
   Die anf \& auml;ngliche Reaktion der Europ \& auml;ischen Union (EU) auf
   die aus der Ukraine fliehenden Menschen war ungew \& ouml;hnlich
   einstimmig und einladend und gipfelte in der raschen Aktivierung der
   Richtlinie \& uuml;ber vor \& uuml;bergehenden Schutz. Diese \&
   uuml;berwiegend humanit \& auml;re Reaktion stellt einen Sonderfall und
   Ausrei ss er in Bezug auf die Art und Weise dar, wie die EU und ihre
   Mitgliedstaaten auf bisherige Vertreibungen reagiert haben. In diesem
   Beitrag werden die diskursiven Konstruktionen analysiert, die diese
   Reaktion erm \& ouml;glichten. Hierzu wird untersucht, wie die
   erzwungene Migration aus der Ukraine in den europ \& auml;ischen
   politischen Diskursen beschrieben wurde. Ausgehend von
   diskurstheoretischen Ans \& auml;tzen und der kritischen
   Migrationsforschung nehmen wir an, dass der Diskurs von den Kategorien
   ,,Ethnie{''}, ,,Geschlecht{''} und ,,Distanz{''} gepr \& auml;gt ist,
   die mit Vorstellungen von nationaler Identit \& auml;t und europ \&
   auml;ischen Werten verbunden sind. Um den europ \& auml;ischen Diskurs
   auf mehreren Ebenen abzubilden, rekonstruieren wir den politischen
   Diskurs auf EU-Ebene sowie in zwei unterschiedlichen F \& auml;llen,
   Polen und Deutschland. Unsere Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass der
   europ \& auml;ische Diskurs trotz nationaler Unterschiede und des
   Vorhandenseins etablierter Tropen der Schutzw \& uuml;rdigkeit nicht nur
   auf Vorstellungen \& uuml;ber die Verletzlichkeit des ukrainischen
   Anderen und des europ \& auml;ischen Selbst beruht, sondern auch von der
   Wahrnehmung des bedrohlichen russischen Anderen beeinflusst wird. Vor
   allem in Polen wird die Aufnahme von Fl \& uuml;chtlingen aus der
   Ukraine mit Sicherheitsbedenken in Verbindung gebracht, w \& auml;hrend
   die EU und der deutsche Diskurs die Rolle der europ \& auml;ischen Werte
   und der Solidarit \& auml;t betonen. Daher sollte die Aufnahme
   ukrainischer Fl \& uuml;chtlinge als Teil der europ \& auml;ischen
   Antwort auf die russische Aggression verstanden werden und nicht als
   Abkehr von der bisherigen Haltung zur Migration.},

Abstract = {The paper introduces a deep-learning model fine-tuned for detecting
   authoritarian discourse in political speeches. Set up as a regression
   problem with weak supervision logic, the model is trained for the task
   of classification of segments of text for being/not being associated
   with authoritarian discourse. Rather than trying to define what an
   authoritarian discourse is, the model builds on the assumption that
   authoritarian leaders inherently define it. In other words,
   authoritarian leaders talk like authoritarians. When combined with the
   discourse defined by democratic leaders, the model learns the instances
   that are more often associated with authoritarians on the one hand and
   democrats on the other. The paper discusses several evaluation tests
   using the model and advocates for its usefulness in a broad range of
   research problems. It presents a new methodology for studying latent
   political concepts and positions as an alternative to more traditional
   research strategies.},

Abstract = {Freedom of information (FOI) rose to saliency in the early Cold War
   period as the presidency grappled with controlling what government
   information was made public or available to Congress. A lack of formal
   structures and authority provided presidents with the opportunity to
   unilaterally shape new policies and structures. One such structure was
   the Office of Strategic Information (OSI), created by a National
   Security Council directive and housed in the Commerce Department.
   Congress utilized its oversight power by creating the Moss Subcommittee
   on Government Information to investigate these new policies and
   structures. Over a 4-year period in the mid-1950s, an interbranch power
   struggle emerged over what authority existed within the executive branch
   to deny information and testimony to Congress. OSI is one example in a
   larger context of FOI that left Congress seeking to clarify executive
   authority within existing statutes and among new structures, leading to
   the passage of the first freedom of information law in 1958. Original
   archival research is used to provide insight into the complexities of
   governing in a separation of powers system. This early case study
   informs contemporary politics on congressional access to executive
   information.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that policymakers and policy outcomes in
   advanced democracies are biased against the preferences of less affluent
   and working-class citizens. One reason for this inequality in
   substantive representation might be that most policymakers are well-off
   themselves. In this paper, we explore the effect of shared class
   background on the congruence between legislators' and citizens' policy
   preferences. To do so, we rely on original data from surveys conducted
   among citizens and active legislators in Switzerland. We focus on six
   economic and welfare policy proposals where we find differences in
   opinion between social classes. When we match legislators' and citizens'
   opinion in a one-to-many relationship, we find that social class matters
   more for lower social classes than for the more affluent, at least for
   some policy proposals.
   J \& uuml;ngste Studien haben gezeigt, dass die politischen
   Entscheidungstr \& auml;gerInnen und die Ergebnisse \& ouml;ffentlicher
   Politiken in fortgeschrittenen Demokratien die Pr \& auml;ferenzen der
   weniger wohlhabenden und arbeitenden B \& uuml;rgerInnen weniger bzw.
   nicht ber \& uuml;cksichtigen. Ein Grund f \& uuml;r diese Ungleichheit
   in der inhaltlichen politischen Vertretung k \& ouml;nnte darin liegen,
   dass die meisten PolitikerInnen selbst sehr wohlhabend sind. Unsere
   Studie untersucht die Auswirkungen des gemeinsamen Klassenhintergrunds
   auf die \& Uuml;bereinstimmung zwischen den politischen Pr \&
   auml;ferenzen der PolitikerInnen und der B \& uuml;rgerInnen. Dabei st
   \& uuml;tzen wir uns auf Originaldaten aus Umfragen, die unter B \&
   uuml;rgerInnen und aktiven ParlamentarierInnen in der Schweiz durchgef
   \& uuml;hrt wurden. Wir konzentrieren uns auf sechs wirtschafts- und
   sozialpolitische Vorschl \& auml;ge, bei denen wir Meinungsunterschiede
   zwischen den sozialen Schichten feststellen. Wenn wir die Meinungen von
   PolitikerInnen und B \& uuml;rgerInnen in einer Eins-zu-Viel-Beziehung
   abgleichen, stellen wir fest, dass die soziale Schicht f \& uuml;r
   untere soziale Schichten eine gr \& ouml;ss ere Rolle spielt als f \&
   uuml;r wohlhabendere, zumindest bei einigen politischen Vorschl \&
   auml;gen.

   opinions des parlementaires et des citoyens dans une relation de type <<

   Studi recenti hanno dimostrato che i politici e i risultati delle
   politiche pubbliche nelle democrazie avanzate hanno un bias contrario
   alle preferenze dei cittadini meno abbienti e della classe operaia. Una
   delle ragioni di questa disuguaglianza nella rappresentanza sostanziale
   potrebbe essere che la maggior parte dei politici sono essi stessi
   benestanti. In questo articolo esploriamo l'effetto della condivisione
   del background di classe sulla congruenza tra le preferenze politiche
   dei legislatori e dei cittadini. Per farlo, ci basiamo su dati originali
   provenienti da sondaggi condotti tra cittadini e legislatori attivi in
   Svizzera. Ci concentriamo su sei proposte di politica economica e di
   welfare per le quali riscontriamo differenze di opinione tra le classi
   sociali. Quando abbiniamo le opinioni dei legislatori e dei cittadini in
   una relazione uno-a-molti, scopriamo che la classe sociale conta di pi
   \& ugrave; per le classi sociali pi \& ugrave; basse che per quelle pi
   \& ugrave; agiate, almeno per alcune proposte politiche.},

Abstract = {The UK's 2024 general election was the least proportional of modern
   times. Labour's substantial parliamentary majority rested on the
   smallest ever winning party vote share. The Conservatives, meanwhile,
   suffered one of their worst ever results. While political and economic
   events during the 2019-2024 Parliament were key to the outcome, the
   operation of the first past the post electoral system was also
   important. In 2024, it was strongly biased in Labour's favour and
   against the Conservatives, contributing substantially to the scale of
   their defeat and of Labour's victory, allowing Labour to parlay modest
   support into a large majority. This pro-Labour bias was to a large
   extent a result of the much greater efficiency of Labour's geography of
   support. We place the relative Conservative-Labour bias at the 2024
   contest into a longer historical perspective, demonstrating that it
   marked the abrupt end of a ten-year period in which electoral bias had
   favoured the Conservatives.},

Abstract = {Guatemala ranks last in the region in terms of the penetration and
   perception of state corruption ranking 149th out of 180 countries.
   Therefore it has promoted anti-corruption initiatives such as the
   International Commission Against Impunity (CICIG 2007-2019). The CICIG
   was a unique public policy initiative worldwide with international
   community support and significant progress in reducing corruption.
   However what were the main failures encountered during the
   implementation process of the CICIG? This comparative individual case
   study analyzes two factors: sustainability and capacity building. The
   explanations for the CICIG's disruptions are not understood exclusively
   as the absence of state capacity much less because of its design. My
   qualitative research delves into endogenous political contexts (client
   networks resilience). The research identifies some fissures in
   implementation and draws lessons that can be extrapolated to public
   policy in Latin America.},

Abstract = {During crises, executives are empowered at the expense of legislatures.
   This applied also to the COVID period. Focusing on two stable yet
   different European democracies, France and Finland, this article
   examines the internal and external factors affecting the ability of
   parliaments to control the executive during the pandemic. The empirical
   analysis considers institutional developments affecting parliaments as
   well as the behaviour of MPs. The benefit of hindsight enables us to
   assess the entire COVID period, showing that in both countries the
   initial dominance of the executive was followed by more assertive
   parliamentary behaviour. The results indicate that, despite difficult
   conditions, parliaments in both countries displayed adaptability and
   resilience, but power constellations pre-dating the COVID period
   impacted on the respective roles of the French and Finnish parliaments.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic created special challenges for faculty members
   whose classes were ones relying heavily on in-person interaction,
   including those whose courses involve active citizenship and community
   engagement. Here, I present my use of digital graphic novels in online
   pedagogy as a way I managed to accomplish this in a digital, socially
   distanced environment. The digital graphic novels provided a way for
   students to engage in digital citizenship and a hands-on activity in
   which they learned and created visual digital communication-one of the
   most dominant forms of modern-day civic communication. It also pulled in
   a wildly popular format with ``Generation Z{''} students. Faculty
   members, though, should make sure that what they do is rooted in course
   outcomes and emphasize that though this activity may be fun, graphic
   novels are tools and not the subject matter itself.},

Abstract = {We study the implications of post-treatment bias in the context of the
   globalization backlash. We discuss whether horse-race regressions can
   inform about the relative role of economic versus cultural drivers. We
   make three methodological points: (1) if and insofar as cultural
   variables are post-treatment with respect to economic factors, the
   estimates of the effect of economic shocks on voting are biased in
   regressions that include cultural controls (and vice versa); (2) for the
   same reason, such horse-race regressions do not allow to accurately
   estimate the relative role of economic versus cultural factors; (3) one
   cannot infer mediation effects from changes in regression coefficients
   for a given factor of interest before and after including post-treatment
   controls. We accompany the methodological discussion with empirical
   evidence on the relevance of post-treatment bias in studies of the
   globalization backlash, both by replicating and expanding on earlier
   studies, and by presenting novel cross-country results on the
   culture-economy nexus.},

   education and attitudinal predictors on support for the Finns Party},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study explores support for the populist far-right Finns Party in
   the 2023 Finnish parliamentary election. In the 2023 election, the Finns
   Party obtained their largest historical vote share, which led to the
   party's inclusion in the current coalition government. Utilizing an
   original, nationally representative survey, we find that Finns Party
   support can mainly be explained by political entrepreneurship and the
   attraction of voters holding antiimmigrant sentiment. While we find that
   other attitudes had some relationship with Finns Party support, the
   substantive impact of these attitudes is far less substantial than are
   attitudes towards immigrants. Further, we find that the impact of
   attitudes towards immigrants and Finns Party vote choice intention is
   conditional on education level. Attitudes towards immigrants have a more
   limited impact on Finns Party support for respondents at higher
   education levels when compared with those at lower levels. The findings
   hold significance for the broader literature on populist parties,
   demonstrating that education can significantly diminish the translation
   of anti-immigration attitudes into support for far-right parties.},

Title = {Partisan (A) Symmetries in Hardball: Mass Level Support of Hardball
   Equivalent Across Party and Race},

Abstract = {Constitutional hardball is when partisan actors engage in legal tactics
   that violate democratic norms for political advantage. The Republican
   Party seems to have engaged in hardball more than the Democratic Party
   in recent years, which is surprising as both parties should be similarly
   incentivized to use hardball. This asymmetry in elite behavior could
   reflect differences in what each parties' coalitions tolerate. For
   example, non-white voters might oppose hardball tactics more than white
   voters for reasons such as hardball historically being used to enforce
   racial hierarchies. If true, that could constrain on Democratic elites'
   actions more Republican elites due to Democrats' more racially diverse
   base. I draw on a long line of research on partisanship and group
   interest to argue instead that both white and non-white voters of both
   parties should be similarly disposed towards hardball. This article then
   marshals data from the American National Election Survey (ANES) and
   original surveys to test that argument. In support of my hypotheses, I
   find white and non-white members of both parties have similar levels of
   support and similar motivations for hardball. Political elites are
   likely free to engage in undemocratic acts such as hardball with little
   fear of backlash from their supporters.},

   question in a non-western context},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {92},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Since the late 1970s, intergovernmental relationships worldwide have
   undergone an unequivocal transformation, with powers increasingly
   shifting toward subnational governments. One of the expected outcomes of
   decentralization reforms is a (re)vitalization of participation in
   subnational decision-making. If available empirical evidence tends to
   support this claim, it has remained primarily restricted to Western
   countries. This article leverages asymmetric decentralization
   arrangements in Ukraine to re-examine the effect of decentralization on
   voter turnout in a diverging setting. It conducts matching and
   regression analyses using an original city-level dataset that combines
   electoral, census, administrative, financial and geospatial data. The
   results converge on a significantly positive effect on voter turnout in
   local elections of more than 4 percentage points. Additional analyses
   concerning the mechanisms suggest that the effect might be driven by
   citizens' awareness of electoral stakes. Interestingly, the increase in
   voter turnout appears concomitant with lower perceived local government
   performance.},

Abstract = {This article examines the narrative framework in European Union (EU)
   research and innovation projects, focusing on symbolic practices and
   terminology. The analysis includes over five years of ethnographic
   research, and 20 European projects funded by Horizon 2020, Horizon
   Europe, and Erasmus+ programs. It explores different ways project actors
   internalize and reproduce the EU's symbolic power through its policies,
   particularly the ambiguous concept of ``innovation.{''} Using Bourdieu's
   theory of practice, the research highlights the way social structures
   within the ``project field{''} influence dynamics and outcomes, often
   resulting in a gap between rhetoric and reality. The study also uncovers
   broader political and social implications of these practices, calling
   for critical reflection of their impact. In its conclusion, the authors
   discuss the challenges of maintaining genuine innovation amidst
   bureaucratic requirements and the EU's symbolic power, advocating for
   more nuanced and context-aware project practices.},

Abstract = {The article revolves around various perspectives pertaining to India's
   infatuation with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). With the
   number of opportunities that the corridor seeks to present for Pakistan,
   from infrastructure and energy to numerous employment opportunities,
   this report showcases instances of India's hybrid intervention and
   continued stance opposing CPEC. While India has held its ground
   strategically which encompasses a resilient attention and budget to the
   cause of intervening in the corridor, it could become a major obstacle
   in Pakistan's need for the multifaceted opportunities that it has
   presented. With the creation of innumerable employment, energy and
   taxes, this corridor has helped boost Pakistan's economy substantially.
   Moreover, the second phase of the corridor, which is known as CPEC 2.0,
   is being initiated and implemented, which presents a multitude of
   opportunities including agricultural and industrial ones. Therefore, any
   obstacle that is put in the way of this corridor could in turn affect
   the economic growth of Pakistan. While discussing the trajectory of
   India's `obsession', its deep-rooted history with Pakistan and China is
   immensely significant. Therefore, the aforementioned facets could
   present a number of implications not only for Pakistan but also for the
   entire region considering India's recent policies and hegemonic designs.},

Abstract = {The entrance into the Anthropocene Epoch has pushed historians and
   social scientists to reconsider human history through new lenses and
   along an entirely different timeline. For historians, the notion of the
   Anthropocene can be seen as an overarching category superimposed on the
   usual chronological divisions into ancient, medieval, modern, and
   contemporary history. In social sciences in general, the notion of the
   Anthropocene has been embraced, often critically, by enlarging its
   semantic field through a series of neologisms, which this article aims
   to analyze and contribute to. Originating from within stratigraphy and
   geology, the new coining for a (not yet official) epoch acts as a
   tectonic shift by bringing geology into history, as well as into
   humanities and social sciences. Paradoxically, it could be said that
   humans are being ``ejected from history{''} just as geology enriches
   itself with a human-centered eponym, Anthropocene, that is, when
   specific actions carried out by a single biological species, homo
   sapiens, have spawned consequences so deep and everlasting that an
   imprint upon the Earth's stratigraphy has been impressed forever. These
   specific actions can be encapsulated in a single term: overconsumption,
   possibly accompanied by its twin dimension, overexploitation (of
   resources) (Nature,588(7838), 442-444. 2020; Communications Earth \&
   Environment,1(1), 32. 2020). This article sets out to identify the
   period and sequence of events leading to the shift from consumption to
   overconsumption and from exploitation to overexploitation. Identifying
   the moment these transitions occurred is essential, as the double excess
   of ``over{''} patterns has characterized what is commonly understood as
   the Anthropocene Epoch.},

Abstract = {In 1938, Congress enacted the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) as a
   tool to identify and potentially combat Nazi propaganda. In the 1960s,
   FARA was amended to shift its focus from capturing propaganda to
   documenting the advocacy relationship between foreign principals (e.g.,
   governments, political parties, and corporations) and the US government.
   Today, foreign agents-those hired by foreign principals to represent
   their interests-are required to register with the Department of Justice
   unless they meet one of the eight statutory exemptions, including one
   that allows for the registration under the Lobbying Disclosure Act
   (LDA), a 1995 law that requires lobbyists to register with Congress.
   This paper provides background on FARA, LDA, and how they interact.
   Using data from both laws, three logit regression models test the
   importance of American foreign assistances and international alliance
   connections on a countries decision to hire an advocate in the USA. The
   analysis demonstrates that countries that receive have more
   international alliance connections with the USA are more likely to hire
   a foreign agent, lobbyist, or both. Those that receive more foreign
   assistance are more likely to hire a lobbyist or a lobbyist and a
   foreign agent.},

Abstract = {One reason given for declining levels of trust in politicians and
   institutions is the incidence of scandals involving voters'
   representatives. Politicians implicated in scandals, especially
   financial scandals, typically see their constituents' support for them
   decrease. It has been suggested that these specific negative judgements
   about a representative's misconduct spill over onto diffuse political
   trust in the system as a whole. We argue that the 2009 Parliamentary
   expenses scandal in the United Kingdom is a strong test of these scandal
   spillover effects in a non-experimental context. Yet, using a multilevel
   analysis of survey and representative implication data, we find no
   evidence for these effects. This is despite voters being aware of their
   MP's scandal implication, and this awareness affecting voters' support
   for their own MP. We conclude that voters' judgements about their
   constituency representatives are unlikely to affect their diffuse
   political trust.},

Title = {Kenya: Socio-Demographic Determinants of Intractable Communal Land Use
   Conflicts in the Squatter Enclaves of Mount Elgon Region},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Number = {49},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the post-Cold War world order, the African Continent has been a stage
   for some of the most violent intra-state conflicts arising from natural
   resources and land distribution. These contestations have often been
   inter-communal and take the violent extremism route. The consequences of
   these devastating contestations have been apocalyptic in most of these
   conflicts. In Kenya's Mount Elgon Region, the emergence of extremism
   Sabaot Land Defence Forces and counter-extremist groups is rooted in a
   long historical struggle for equitable distribution of land rights.
   Despite efforts by state and non-state actors, sustainable peace remains
   a distant mirage. Socio-economic determinants have emerged as
   fundamental determinants in these extremist contestations, yet, extant
   literature has been silent on this subject matter. This paper sought to
   interrogate socio-demographic determinants as pathways for homegrown
   extremism in the Mount Elgon Region. Study findings revealed strong
   support for the interplay between ownership of land, source of income,
   level of education, and sustenance of homegrown extremism over land-use
   conflicts in the study area. The paper recommends the need for the
   Ministry of Lands to expedite the management of the historical land
   question to contain the socio-demographic determinants as pathways for
   homegrown extremism in the study area. The findings underscore the
   importance of land tenure security in pursuit of peaceful, just, and
   inclusive societies as advocated for in the Sustainable Development
   Agenda 2030.},

   (RDM) . A third suit against MTN was also filed in the Eastern District
   of New York in Zobay et al. v. MTN Group Limited et al., No.
   1:21-cv-03503-CBA. The suit was filed by 67 American Gold Star family
   members, servicemembers, and their families, who were involved in
   several attacks by the Taliban which left many US soldiers dead and
   others injured between 2009 and 2017. In the case filed in the Eastern
   District of New York, the claimants averred that MTN violated the US
   Anti-Terrorism Act by making payments to the Taliban to protect its
   cellular towers and other infrastructure from being attacked and
   destroyed by the Taliban militants. The claimants allege that the
   payments arrangement between MTN and the Taliban began in 2006 which has
   since continued and adds up to hundreds of millions of dollars. The
   claimants further aver that these sums have been a major source of
   funding the Taliban's attacks against the United States troops. These
   cases have another geo-political dimension as the court documents
   referred to a joint venture between MTN and the Iranian Islamic
   Revolutionary Guard Corps (the ``IRGC{''}) under a formal agreement to
   support the security need of IRGC which the plaintiff considers to be
   terrorist activities.},

Abstract = {Despite the importance of authoritarian and nationalist values in
   military culture, we know little about the link between the military and
   the far right. In this article we argue that there is an ideological
   affinity between the military and far-right parties, strengthened by
   occupational socialization. Moreover, the presence of military
   institutions also helps mobilizing far-right support among the
   surrounding population. We test this argument using data from Spain. We
   show both that military personnel are substantially more likely than
   civilians to support the far right and that the location of military
   facilities in Spain is linked to higher far-right support. We also
   discuss the generalizability of the results and provide tentative
   evidence that a similar link is likely to be observed in countries where
   the armed forces have been historically focused on controlling internal
   dissent and where national sovereignty has been threatened by either
   internal or external challengers.},

Abstract = {British values were formally defined and institutionalised in the
   aftermath of the Trojan Horse Affair in 2014 and as part of the UK's
   counterterrorism strategy. In this article, I analyse the idea of
   ``British values{''} as an element of coloniality and ask why the UK's
   counterterrorism rhetoric, of which Prevent is a part, is centred on the
   concept of ``British values{''}. The article shows how the discourse,
   and the promotion of British values, serves as a securitising and
   categorising agent which essentialises specific groups of people. In the
   contemporary context, this affects Muslims in particular, who are
   constructed as ``other{''} and naturally hostile to or incompatible with
   British values. It argues that the rhetoric of the concept of ``British
   values{''} and its application has been used as a form of distinction,
   not just today but also historically; this distinction has been built on
   colonialism and is sustained through coloniality. Through ``British
   values{''}, the civilising mission lives on within the UK's
   counterterrorism strategy and within Prevent more specifically.},

Abstract = {Political marketing is a major trend in politics, and election campaigns
   are no exception. This article analyzes the online political branding
   strategies of La R \& eacute;publique En Marche (LREM) candidates to the
   French legislative elections in 2017. News media has been quick to
   characterize these candidates as political outsiders determined to
   overturn traditional political codes. Considering this narrative toward
   their candidacy, this paper seeks to assess what influence this
   positioning has on their political branding behavior. Given the media
   hybrid system, we are particularly interested in their use of media news
   shared on their Facebook pages. How do they mobilize this content to
   build a personal brand? We show that LREM candidates are particularly
   inclined to relay content from the local press in order to make their
   personalities better known to voters. Our results point to an equalizing
   (or even catching-up) effect of this practice in the personal branding
   work between candidates.},

Abstract = {In multiethnic societies, domestic minority groups are frequently
   associated with external adversaries. In such situations, external
   confrontations may potentially exacerbate internal ethnic conflict by
   increasing intolerance toward the domestic minority. Alternatively, they
   may result in rallying the public around a common superordinate national
   identity. We examine the case of India, which has a long-running rivalry
   with Muslim-majority Pakistan. Through a large (n = 7052) survey
   experiment, we find little evidence that a hypothetical crisis with
   Pakistan worsens attitudes toward India's large Muslim minority.
   Instead, we find that such a crisis may improve intergroup cohesion
   within India, improving tolerance towards Muslim minorities.},

Title = {The Bank of England and conservative sound money politics: economic
   ideas in a contested political sphere},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {74-94},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Over the course of the 2010s, Conservative politicians criticised the
   Bank of England for meddling in markets and punishing `prudent' savers.
   Partly in response to this, Bank officials risked their own reputations
   by adopting new forms of communicative engagement with the public and
   attempting to defend the prevailing consensus on monetary policy. This
   paper draws on both qualitative coding of transcripts of Treasury
   Committee hearings and 11 interviews with Bank staff and officials to
   support its central claim that the politics of monetary policy takes
   place in a conflictual political sphere in which different interests,
   values and identities are mobilised in opposed ideologies of monetary
   governance. This qualitative approach helps to identify the ideological
   substance of public debates about monetary policy. The conflict between
   Conservative sound money and Bank monetary policy orthodoxy is
   conceptualised as a divide within the neoliberal consensus, with more
   progressive views marginalised or absent. Central bankers do not merely
   seek to publicly defend their reputations, while relegating the politics
   of economic ideas to abstruse debates among technocrats. Rather, central
   bankers are political actors in a relatively open, public and
   conflictual political sphere.},

Abstract = {Governments across the Global South have begun introducing biometric IDs
   (eIDs) in an attempt to improve citizen-state legibility. While such
   initiatives can improve government efficiency, they also raise important
   questions about citizen privacy, especially for groups with a history of
   mistrust in the state. If concerns about increased legibility produce
   differential uptake or changes in political behavior, eID initiatives
   may exacerbate societal inequalities. In a conjoint experiment with
   2,072 respondents from four Kenyan regions, we examine how perceptions
   of and willingness to register for eID under different policy conditions
   vary across politically dominant, opposition, and ``securitized{''}
   (heavily policed) ethnic groups. We find meaningful group-level
   variation in support for specific policy features, and suggestive
   evidence that policies facilitating surveillance may discourage
   opposition political participation. Our most surprising finding,
   however, is that there is such broad support for expanded legibility.
   The promise of access to government services appears to outweigh other
   considerations.},

Abstract = {This article examines the domestic political dynamics surrounding the
   negotiations between Switzerland and the European Union (EU) on the
   Institutional Framework Agreement. It identifies the main domestic
   difficulties that prevented an agreement from being reached. The
   empirical reconstruction of the negotiations suggests that domestic
   consensus became very difficult because the issues under negotiation
   were two-dimensional, activating both the anti-EU and the left-right
   dimensions. Moreover, the data suggest two main factors that prevented
   this difficulty from being resolved. First, political parties across the
   political spectrum were internally divided on the issues under
   negotiation. Second, the worsening corporatist dynamic between the
   Confederation and the social partners, as well as between the social
   partners themselves, made it very difficult to activate the concessions
   to the trade unions that had been used in previous EU negotiations to
   secure their agreement.},

Abstract = {The rise of new financial transaction schemes enabled new forms of tax
   fraud in Europe in the 2010s. Despite extensive public attention to this
   issue, the political measures adopted to strengthen taxation control
   have remained remarkably lax. The article analyses the emergence and
   spread of US neoliberal problematisations of administrative burdens to
   the OECD, and how these problematisations coalesced with the development
   of standardized regulatory cost-benefit techniques. Focusing on the
   Danish case, this constellation of problematizations and techniques is
   argued to have worked as an economic tribunal, effectively obstructing
   the control of tax dividend reclaims.},

Abstract = {Despite the stalling of enlargement countries' accession to the EU,
   these countries have been recurrently involved in EU policies. There is,
   however, little knowledge about their participation in EU policies short
   of membership. This article conceptualises such participation as a
   manifestation of external differentiated cooperation. It offers a
   theoretical approach accounting for the unfolding of external
   differentiated cooperation in EU interactions with enlargement countries
   as a strategy of system maintenance. External differentiated
   cooperation, the article argues, serves as a strategy for the EU to
   address increased mutual dependences with enlargement countries
   triggered by crises-induced shocks to the EU system of regional
   integration. By examining EU-Western Balkans' interactions from 2014 to
   2023, the article shows that the EU and its relevant actors have
   resorted to external differentiated cooperation to ensure the
   functioning of the EU system of regional integration against the
   backdrop of member states' reluctance towards EU enlargement.},

Abstract = {Fact-checks have been shown to be effective in correcting specific false
   beliefs, but do they also cause people to update their broader views
   about the phenomenon in question? We consider this question in the
   context of the 2022 Arizona governor's race, testing the effect of
   debunking false claims of fraud on specific beliefs about that election
   as well as general confidence in the 2022 and 2020 U.S. elections and
   beliefs about the prevalence of fraud. Our results indicate that
   fact-checks reduce false beliefs about the election in Arizona, but we
   find no evidence that participants extrapolate these findings to their
   general beliefs about fraud or their confidence in the 2022 or 2020
   elections. These results suggest that methods of combating
   misinformation that rely on case-by-case corrections of specific
   falsehoods may not be effective in changing broader false beliefs.},

Abstract = {Center-region relations in Russia experienced several zigzags in the
   process of consolidation of the central control over the regions,
   influenced by a complex interplay between formal and informal
   institutions and practices. Through the lenses of neopatrimonialism, the
   study explores the challenges Russian governors face in the process of
   consolidation of their personal power at the regional level. l. Drawing
   on empirical research conducted in Sverdlovsk and Perm Krai, the study
   contends that, despite the establishment of the so-called `power
   vertical', the neo-patrimonial equilibrium in Russia is marked by
   multiple tensions. In this system, personal style and skills, the
   constellation of actors at the central and regional levels, and the
   horizontal interaction between networks play an important role, making
   center-region relations more dynamic and complex. Hence the hierarchical
   model of territorial control appears less stable and predictable in the
   long run.},

Abstract = {Social theory debates over the ecological crisis have long hinged on the
   realism/constructivism dichotomy. More recently a different divide has
   taken hold, mostly in connection with the rise of new materialisms: that
   between dualism and anti-dualism. A new season has also opened in the
   traditional materialist standpoint in social theory, namely Marxism.
   Here the dualism/anti-dualism dichotomy dovetails with the question of
   the dialectic between society and nature. Against this backdrop, the
   question the paper addresses is: what ontology does an effective
   critique of late capitalism's take on nature need? To answer, the
   salient features of new materialisms are considered first. Their
   convergence with what may be called capitalism's own ontological turn is
   highlighted. Subsequently eco-Marxist debates are addressed, where Luk
   \& aacute;cs's view of the dialectic of nature has been gaining
   salience. The paper dwells especially on a contribution by Kohei Saito.
   Though innovative, it is argued, it does not adequately capture the
   terms of late capitalism's assault on nature, just like most eco-Marxist
   approaches. Adorno's theory provides a promising approach in this
   regard, also offering a ground for confrontation between new
   materialisms and Marxist materialism and a way to effectively address
   unresolved Marxist diatribes.},

Journal = {DYNAMICS OF ASYMMETRIC CONFLICT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Geopolitical transformations have drastic effects in many spheres of
   public life. Their most prominent manifestations are observed with
   regard to ethno-political conflicts and their settlement processes,
   particularly when they are accompanied by serious regional
   rearrangements. The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and the process of its
   settlement are among the most typical cases in this regard. After the
   2018 change of power in Armenia, the normally developing process of the
   Nagorno-Karabakh conflict settlement within the framework of the main
   principles of international law ended up in sharp upheavals, succumbing
   to the logic of the sharply heated West-Russia geopolitical
   confrontation. The formation of antagonistic relations between the
   Co-Chair states of the OSCE Minsk Group undermined their mediation
   efforts, leaving two options for the resolution of the conflict: the
   realization of people's right to self-determination with the support of
   international community or the genocide of the Nagorno-Karabakh people.
   The article considers the threats of a catastrophic development of
   events due to changes in the positions of powerful actors regarding the
   conflict settlement under the influence of geopolitical transformations,
   as well as the possibility of preventing such a development.},

   case of Chile},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 29},
Abstract = {This article seeks to test empirically to what extent localist behavior
   by legislators is influenced by electoral vulnerability in Chile,
   following a recent electoral reform. Our results show that such a
   relationship exists in the case of non-legislative speeches delivered in
   the Chamber of Deputies, but not in the case of personal meetings held
   by parliamentarians with constituents. Furthermore, we found that the
   relationship between electoral vulnerability and a focus on local issues
   depends on district magnitude. By examining pre- and post-reform
   periods, after district magnitude was increased while preserving
   proportional rules, we also show that incentives to cultivate personal
   votes are more nuanced under the reformed system.},

Abstract = {No politician in Italy has embodied the characteristics of the Second
   Republic more profoundly than Silvio Berlusconi. This is not only
   because he served as Prime Minister on four occasions over three
   decades, and, along with Alcide De Gasperi, is the only leader to have
   completed an entire legislature. Nor is it solely due to the fact that
   Berlusconi's mandates appeared to have been bestowed directly, by the
   people, an impression facilitated by the bipolarization of the party
   system he helped establish and which paved the way for the processes of
   Italian presidentialization. Most significantly, it is because
   Berlusconi adopted a personal presidency, navigating the tension between
   two elements. On one hand, he increasingly sought more powers for
   himself, showing great impatience with the perceived procedural delays
   of Parliament and oversight bodies; on the other hand, he never fully
   institutionalized a new role for the leader of the Government, leaving
   it inextricably tied to and dependent on his persona. This article aims
   to explore the role Silvio Berlusconi played as Presidente del Consiglio
   dei Ministri (President of the Council of Ministers) and to examine his
   political-institutional legacy.},

Abstract = {This article contextualizes Hong Kong's Umbrella Movement that emerged
   in the fall of 2014. We argue that first, the Umbrella Movement was not
   merely about democracy but must be understood in the context of widening
   inequality and an ongoing housing and wage crisis; second, that it is
   part of a broader epoch of contention informed by, third, a distinct
   ``rhizomatic movement logic{''} that is defined by a diversity of actors
   and struggles, use of social media, leaderless and grassroots
   mobilizing, distrust of institutional actors. Fueled by shifts in
   capital accumulation and changes in communication technologies, the
   currently dominant movement logic is distinct from previous movement
   politics. Since the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, Mexico, in 1994, it
   has informed movements such as Occupy, the Arab Spring, and more
   recently the Gilets Jaunes as well as the Umbrella Movement. To be sure,
   we are not claiming that all these struggles are the same. We stress the
   similarities exhibited by these movements' ``deep grammar,{''} so to
   speak, while recognizing that each must be understood in its
   particularities. We thus specify the context of Hong Kong and provide
   illustrations of how this logic has impacted the Umbrella Movement's
   actors, organizing, and movement-building dynamics.},

Volume = {95},

Abstract = {This article reviews the record of Germany's current coalition
   government consisting of the SPD, Greens and liberal FDP under
   chancellor Olaf Scholz, a member of the SPD. Since 2021, the coalition's
   failure to set a coherent policy agenda, permanent infighting and
   external challenges, such as the Ukraine war and immigration, have led
   to a dramatic decay in support for the governing parties. The opposition
   CDU/CSU has profited little from the government's weakness, while the
   rightist AfD rides high in opinion polls and elections. Conversely, Die
   Linke experienced a split in December 2023 when a group of its
   legislators-led by Sahra Wagenknecht, the former co-chair of the left's
   parliamentary group, decided to found a new political party, the
   `Alliance Sahra Wagenknecht-Reason and Justice'. The article evaluates
   Wagenknecht's political discourse which aims to combine progressive
   welfare and conservative migration policies. It is suggested that
   Wagenknecht's `left conservatism' is a promising electoral project
   filling a representation gap in German politics.},

Abstract = {Several disciplines, such as economics, law, and political science,
   emphasize the importance of legislative quality, namely well-written
   legislation. Low-quality legislation cannot be easily implemented
   because the texts create interpretation problems. To measure the quality
   of legal texts, we use information from the syntactic and lexical
   features of their language and apply these measures to a dataset of
   European Union legislation that contains detailed information on its
   transposition and decision-making process. We find that syntactic
   complexity and vagueness are negatively related to member states'
   compliance with legislation. The finding on vagueness is robust to
   controlling for member states' preferences, administrative resources,
   length of texts, and discretion. However, the results for syntactic
   complexity are less robust.},

   monthly council meetings in each borough, we highlight how people define
   politics within the institutions and identify the social categories
   (social class, race, or others) on which processes of politicization
   underlie. We conceive politicization as a filter determining whether and
   how an issue is discussed. To this end, our theoretical framework links
   processes of politicization to an increase in generality and refers to
   the notion of symbolic and social boundaries. Our observation of city
   council meetings challenges the apolitical character of Canadian and
   Quebec municipalities. First, people participating in the councils'
   meetings take politics seriously, even if they distrust institutions.
   Second, two types of politicization are distinguished. A politicization
   through rules reflects a widening of democratic practices, and a
   politicization in substance intersects classes, territories, and races.
   Politicization through rules helps contain conflict but also risks
   depoliticizing the issues. Politicization in substance reflects
   contemporary debates about the construction of justice and, thus, about
   the intersection of social categories.},

Abstract = {Political parties often mobilise issues that can improve their electoral
   fortunes by splitting existing coalitions. We argue that by adopting a
   distinctively adversarial stance, radical right-wing parties have
   increasingly politicised climate change policies as a wedge issue. This
   strategy challenges the mainstream party consensus and seeks to mobilise
   voter concerns over green initiatives. Relying on state-of-the-art
   multilingual large language models, we empirically examine nearly half a
   million press releases from 76 political parties across nine European
   democracies to support this argument. Our findings demonstrate that the
   radical right's oppositional climate policy rhetoric diverges
   significantly from the mainstream consensus. Survey data further reveal
   climate policy scepticism among voters across the political spectrum,
   highlighting the mobilising potential of climate policies as a wedge
   issue. This research advances our understanding of issue competition and
   the politicisation of climate change.},

Abstract = {Education is one of the strongest predictors of political participation
   at the individual level. However, the association between education and
   participation varies across countries, which previous studies attribute
   mainly to institutions like electoral systems. Drawing on policy
   feedback and political socialization theories, we suggest an alternative
   explanation: education policies generate powerful and lasting policy
   feedback effects in adolescence, which continue to influence patterns of
   participation among adults. More concretely, we argue that policies
   aimed at de-stratifying secondary education (i.e., promoting more
   comprehensive models of education) are associated with a decrease in
   political inequality. We empirically investigate our argument in
   Germany, where education policies vary across sub-national units (L \&
   auml;nder) and over time. We leverage this variation by combining data
   on Land-level policies with data on individual's participation. Our
   results show that de-stratifying education policies have reduced in
   inequality in various forms of political participation, interest, and
   efficacy, but not in turnout.},

Abstract = {Prior research finds that women earn fewer citations than men for their
   publications, and it offers various reasons why this is the case. This
   study provides new evidence on these citation differences from two
   datasets on career citations earned by male and female political

   research. Most notably, we find that older cohorts of women demonstrate
   substantial progress toward citation equity with their male peers.},

Abstract = {This study explores the sources of regional favoritism in
   government-invested infrastructure projects. We built an original
   county-level dataset that matches the biographies of 1614 retired
   communist revolutionaries with information on the expansion of China's
   state-directed high-speed railway program. Our findings indicate that a
   surviving revolutionary makes his birth county significantly more likely
   to receive the central government's approval for railway investment.
   This pattern is robust after accounting for a wide range of alternative
   explanations and a natural experiment design that exploits variations in
   the timings of revolutionaries' natural deaths. Additional evidence
   suggests that the empowering effect of the retired revolutionaries stems
   most likely from their assistance in their birth counties' bottom-up
   lobbying of the central government. Their moral authority as the
   founders of the regime helps boost local requests for investment in the
   eyes of central policymakers. Our findings highlight a bottom-up
   intergovernmental dynamic that translates personal influence into policy
   benefits.},

Abstract = {Genocide and mass violence research is predominantly focused on
   asymmetric, large-scale, deliberately targeted physical violence over
   relatively short timespans and involving stable perpetrator and victim
   groups. Recent attempts, such as Dirk Moses's, to redefine the field in
   order to be more inclusive of politically targeted groups, persecuted
   over longer time-spans within and across states go in the right
   direction but still fall short I argue. Instead, I propose a
   capability-based approach, following Amartya Sen, that enables
   consideration of a far broader range of violence's consequences such as
   starvation, systemic malnutrition, excess mortality from disease, and
   economic deprivation. After outlining the capability approach, I apply
   it to two case studies: (1) patterns of depopulation under (asymmetric)
   colonial violence that deprived indigenous communities of the capability
   to sustain their populations through violence, disease, and famines, a
   case which is already being scrutinized by genocide researchers; (2)
   sustained and much less asymmetric violence in the Central African
   Republic with high mortality, malnutrition, and economic deprivation. In
   both cases, the toll of physical violence is substantial, but violence's
   indirect consequences are far more lethal. I argue, that if we are to
   take seriously victims' suffering and loss of lives - a concern that
   ultimately normatively underwrites atrocity and conflict research - only
   the capability approach can encompass these cases.},

Abstract = {Many political scientists hold that vitriolic speech against
   high-profile women has only negligible effects on other women in
   politics. They also contend that the prevalence of such vitriol is
   consistent with gender bias having no significant negative impact on
   most women in politics. This article argues that these sanguine
   positions rest on inadequate and untested assumptions regarding
   misogyny, and the role it plays in politics. In the service of putting
   us in a position to test the relationship between gendered discourse in
   particular elections and the structural obstacles faced by women in
   politics, this article develops a conceptualization of political
   misogyny: nasty claim-making that instills repugnant connotations into
   women's collective political identities (e.g., their partisan
   identities). Attention is also paid to how political misogyny can
   distribute hatred burdens disproportionately among different groups of
   women.},

Abstract = {Under conditions of anarchy, the predominant assumption is that scarcity
   leads to conflict. I contrast traditional Inuit walrus hunt practices to
   Rousseau's stag hunt to demonstrate how mainstream international
   relations has it wrong on three counts: (1) radical scarcity need not
   lead to conflict-prone outcomes, (2) the historical eighteenth-century
   context of the stag hunt does not prove a predisposition against
   cooperation, and (3) the conditions of anarchy are irreducible to
   cultural institutions or to material constraints alone. I leverage
   Latour's ``symmetrical anthropology{''} to demonstrate that ideas and
   things have an equal potential to structure the culture of anarchical
   relations and to build on the literature which has established that
   comparative cultural data can be used to theorize anarchy. Rethinking
   the logic of anarchy is especially important in the age of the
   Anthropocene, given the prospects for radical ecological change in the
   near future.},

Abstract = {Can nativist attitudes condition support for LGBT+ rights? The sustained
   advance in pro-LGBT+ attitudes in the West often contrasts with the
   greening of anti-immigrant sentiment propagated by nativist supply-side
   actors. We argue that these parallel trends are causally connected,
   theorizing that exposure to sexually conservative ethnic out-groups can
   provoke an instrumental increase in LGBT+ inclusion, particularly among
   those hostile toward immigration. Leveraging experiments in Britain and
   Spain, we provide causal evidence that citizens strategically liberalize
   their levels of support for LGBT+ rights when opponents of these
   measures are from the ethnic out-group. In a context where
   sexuality-based liberalism is nationalized, increasing tolerance toward
   LGBT+ citizens is driven by a desire among nativist citizens to socially
   disidentify from those out-groups perceived as inimical to these
   nationalized norms. Our analyses provide a critical interpretation of
   positive trends in LGBT+ tolerance with instrumental liberalism masking
   lower rates of genuine shifts in LGBT+ inclusion.},

Abstract = {How does the political discourse about refugees influence their
   attitudes in the host country? Relying on an online survey and
   experiment conducted with Syrian refugees in Turkey and Germany, this
   study explores the relationship between political discourse and
   refugees' two potential attitudinal responses: political integration and
   return. Our observational analysis demonstrates that refugees'
   perception of the political discourses about them is the variable most
   consistently associated with attitudes in these domains. Our
   experimental results reveal that hostile political discourse, compared
   to a welcoming political discourse, undermines refugees' political
   integration, weakening both their political interest and willingness to
   participate in host country politics. However, our experimental findings
   suggest that political discourse does not significantly impact refugees'
   intentions to return. Overall, our results demonstrate that refugees'
   perceptions of political discourse are an important determinant of their
   attitudes toward host country politics, and more research is warranted
   on the topic.},

Abstract = {Should emigrants be allowed to participate in elections in their country
   of origin? In an era of increasing mobility and migration, the number of
   countries that allow their citizens abroad to vote has increased
   exponentially over the last half century. Relatively little is known,
   however, about how citizens living in countries with external voting
   perceive the extension of voting rights to emigrants. We theorize that
   when external voting might determine the results of an election, voters
   in the origin country will question the election's legitimacy and take
   political stances in favor of limiting the enfranchisement of citizens
   living abroad. We test this theory within the context of Colombian
   politics through an original survey experiment that varies the perceived
   threat of external voters. Specifically, we manipulate both (1)
   information about the size of the electorate abroad, and (2) information
   about the differences in preferences between the electorates in the
   country of origin and abroad. We find that, in general, Colombians
   living in Colombia strongly support voting by citizens living abroad,
   even when primed about the possible political consequences. Our results
   suggest that normative approval of the electoral institution of external
   voting supersedes strategic incentives to support or oppose it.},

Title = {Beyond disdain: Measurement and consequences of negative partisanship as
   a social identity},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {90},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Negative partisanship, voters' rejection of a party, increasingly
   garners scholarly attention. Yet we lack robust empirical evidence on
   the nature of the concept and how it shapes attitudes towards citizens
   of the ``other side{''}of politics. In this paper I argue negative
   partisanship should be conceptualised as a type of social identity,
   beyond a mere ``dislike{''}of a party. Leveraging a three-wave online
   panel administered during the 2021 German federal elections, I test the
   measurement properties of a multi-item scale measuring negative party
   identification. Further, I examine the effects of negative identities on
   attitudes towards other citizens by combining the online panel with a
   nine-country survey. I find that negative identification is at least as
   stable as (positive) partisanship and it predicts hostile attitudes
   towards out-voters. These findings suggest that, when dislike of a party
   becomes part of one's sense of self, the consequences for social
   cohesion are particularly egregious.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 10},
Abstract = {Since the Lisbon Treaty, research on parliaments in EU affairs turned to
   the regional level, but few studies ask how subnational legislators
   engage with the substance of EU policies. We examine this topic based on
   statements by the parliamentary groups in all German Landtage concerning
   the reform of the Posted Workers Directive, which became particularly
   salient when the European Court of Justice liberalized wage clauses in
   state procurement law. Under which conditions did the parliamentary
   groups support the reform? Our configurational analysis reveals that a
   left party identity is the only necessary attribute for support, and
   that it becomes sufficient in conjunction with the group being in
   opposition or with state policy being affected by European
   jurisprudence. We find little evidence that the local economic context
   mattered. The results partly confirm research on the Europeanization of
   state procurement law but highlight the importance of policy shaping
   from below.},

Abstract = {Migration is a social and historical phenomenon with multiple
   dimensions, but transit migration received little research attention.
   This article focuses on characterizing shelters and houses for Central
   American migrants in transit through Mexico, highlighting the crucial
   role of civil society organizations in their care and assistance. Using
   a qualitative methodology and a documentary approach, the study aims to
   promote more rigorous and theoretically grounded work, moving beyond
   mere assistance. The study examines how these organizations provide
   essential services such as food, accommodation, health care, and legal
   advice, improving the quality of life for migrants. Additionally, it
   emphasizes the need for collaboration among stakeholders and the
   importance training personnel. The relevance of researching migrants'
   living conditions to inform public policies and advocate for their
   rights is underscored, advocating for an interdisciplinary approach that
   involves civil society, academia, and the state.},

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {21-24},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {The aim of the text is to reflect on the different paradoxical forms in
   which violence is expressed in a democratic Rule of Law; a Rule of Law
   that, paradoxically, claims to be defined by the non-violent resolution
   of conflicts and by the exclusive monopoly of force in the hands of the
   State (Max Weber). A State that is subject to the principle of legality,
   balance of powers, organic distribution of functions, control and
   division of competences in the exercise of power, in order to avoid any
   form of arbitrariness or abuse. However, it is not only empirical
   evidence that allows us to question this premise, but, at a theoretical
   level, various thinkers such as Foucault, Butler, Agamben, among others,
   have argued how power - unlike violence - circulates in diffuse or
   exceptional forms that - far from being contained in the principle of
   state sovereignty and the rule of law - makes use of this normative
   illusion, making it possible for it to be exercised abusively. It is
   perhaps in Arendt's work where this tension and questioning between
   power and violence is most strongly expressed. The aim of this paper is
   precisely to delve deeper into this opposition in order to attempt a
   cross-critique between power and violence.},

Abstract = {Police killings of individuals with mental illness have prompted calls
   for greater funding of mental health services to shift responsibilities
   away from the police. Such investments can reduce police interactions
   with vulnerable populations but are unlikely to eliminate them entirely,
   particularly in cases in which individuals with mental illness have a
   weapon or are otherwise dangerous. It remains a pressing question, then,
   how police should respond to these and other vulnerable aggressors with
   diminished culpability. This article considers and ultimately rejects
   three potential approaches from the ethics of defensive force
   literature. It looks to improve on them by developing what I call the
   fusion account, which explains how vulnerability and diminished
   culpability fit together to provide moral grounds for extra protections
   from deadly force. The article's final sections explore the policy
   implications of the fusion account for police administrators, officers,
   and the law.},

Abstract = {Environmental degradation can threaten not only the environment and its
   resources but also the very sustainability of the human species. This
   paper sheds light on these interlinked concerns by analyzing the
   evolution and specific regulations of Colombia's Law 2327 of 2023 within
   the broader context of environmental liability management policy.
   Utilizing a document analysis approach, the paper draws upon information
   from specialized databases and legal/ jurisprudential search engines. It
   combines historical and teleological interpretation to shed light on the
   development of environmental liability regulations as a critical concept
   in environmental law and policy. By delving into Law 2327/2023, the
   paper identifies novel features within the framework of environmental
   liability management policy. As a contribution to the ongoing
   discussion, the paper highlights key points of the law, such as the
   restoration of violated rights, the prioritization of environmental
   protection as a supreme legal interest, and areas pending further
   regulation in Colombia within this specific policy.},

   causal effect of successful coups on national incomes. We find that real
   per capita gross domestic product (GDP) decreases by 10\%-12\% 5 years
   after a coup and the effect has not begun to diminish at that point.
   When we investigate the economic and political mechanisms behind this
   outcome, we find that our result is mostly driven by a fall in
   investment and in the rule of law, along with an increase in repression.
   Given the size of the effect, preventing coups can be seen as a
   significant development issue, and though the international community
   has taken steps to discourage coups, further consideration of anticoup
   policies seems well-warranted.},

Abstract = {Parliamentary administration is integral to supporting the work of
   elected politicians. How is it held to account? This article focuses on
   parliamentary questions-one means of scrutinizing parliamentary
   administration. The article uses a qualitative analysis of written and
   oral questions MPs have asked the House of Commons Commission (the body
   responsible for parliamentary administration). It asks three
   sub-questions: (1) Who asks the questions?; (2) What questions are
   asked?; and (3) How are these questions answered? Interrogating these
   questions also provides a window into the internal governance challenges
   of the House of Commons.},

Abstract = {Our ethical responsibilities as researchers within or related to the
   study of ``terrorism{''} could not be clearer than in moments when the
   ``terrorism{''} label is used to justify mass killing and destruction.
   The state of Israel has relentlessly continued to bombard Gaza since 7
   October 2023 and, with the support of Western nations, built consensus
   around framing all Palestinians as (potential) terrorists. In light of
   the horrors that the world is witnessing today, and the lack of
   engagement with Palestine in Critical Terrorism Studies research, we
   ask, how does - and should - Palestine feature in Critical Terrorism
   Studies scholarship? How can we, as researchers and educators,
   facilitate deeper conversations that challenge hegemonic and racist
   framings of ``terrorism{''}? This roundtable discussion brings critical,
   anti-colonial, anti-racist, feminist, and queer scholars together to
   discuss 1) the exclusion of Palestine from the critical study of
   ``terrorism{''} and 2) the significance of the Palestinian struggle for
   liberation for all researchers invested in the critical study of
   ``terrorism{''}. We call for more serious engagement with Palestine and
   acknowledge that such a call is inseparable from a commitment to
   anti-colonial scholarship and activism.(1)},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Religious and regional cleavages have been key for understanding
   Canadian elections, and particularly the domination of the Liberal Party
   of Canada. While the conventional wisdom has been that these two
   cleavages are the most important sociodemographic factors in explaining
   citizens' vote choice, scholars have not paid a lot of attention to
   religious voting in recent elections. In this research note, we provide
   the first systematic post-2011 analysis of religious voting in Canada.
   We do so by leveraging recent Canadian Election Studies. We examine the
   relationship between voters' religious affiliation and level of
   religiosity and vote choice. We show that both facets of religious
   voting matter, but that their impacts vary across parties and regions.
   The findings inform scholarship on Canadian politics as well as
   comparative analyses of sociodemographic cleavages in electoral
   democracies.},

Title = {The case for associational self-regulation of lobbying in the United
   States},
Journal = {INTEREST GROUPS \& ADVOCACY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {478-497},

Abstract = {While governments frequently regulate many trades, businesses, and
   professions, there are limits to which lobbying and advocacy can be
   controlled. This is especially true in the United States where lobbying
   is understood to be a constitutional right and thus protected by the
   courts from significant regulation. I therefore propose that the
   lobbying profession regulate itself through a set of codes of ethics and
   good conduct. There is a long tradition in the United States of
   professions regulating themselves through their associations so that the
   coercive hand of the state is limited and often invisible. In this paper
   I explore this history, briefly compare how associational
   self-regulation happens with architecture, medicine, law, and talent
   managers, and then propose how it might be done for the lobbying
   profession. The paper ends with a proposed code of ethics and conduct
   for the lobbying profession.},

Abstract = {Using a unique dataset of legislators' electoral and biographical data
   in the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia
   and the federal parliament, this article analyses the extent to which
   family dynasties affected the career development of legislators since
   the mid-18th century. We find that the prevalence of dynasties was
   higher in provincial legislatures than it was in the federal parliament,
   that the number of dynasties in the Senate increased until the mid-20th
   century, and that the proportion of dynastic legislators at the
   subnational level was similar to the numbers seen in the United Kingdom
   during the early 19th century. Our results confirm the existence of a
   clear career benefit in terms of cabinet and senate appointments. In
   contrast to the American case and in line with the United Kingdom
   experience, we find no causal relationship between a legislator's tenure
   length and the presence of a dynasty.},

Abstract = {This study provides an analysis of the pathways through which the
   landscape of Transatlantic energy security has been changing. These
   pathways are marked by recent geopolitical crises and two outstanding
   challenges: strengthening energy security and achieving the green
   transition. The Ukraine war and rising tensions in the Middle East have
   once more demonstrated how fragile global supply chains are due to their
   dependence on Russian natural gas and reliance on oil from the Middle
   East. These crises have brought up the urgent need for energy
   diversification, with renewable energy being at the center and a
   strategic means of reducing geopolitical risks in this context. It also
   analyses how the recent developments have redefined the Transatlantic
   region's energy-related perspectives, especially how the United States
   and the European Union cooperate to ensure energy supplies while
   accelerating the transition toward sustainable},

Abstract = {Historians have long identified Benjamin Urner as the first exponent of
   direct legislation in the United States, a claim that has been repeated
   without ever being carefully examined. In this article, I excavate
   Urner's career and political thought and show that while the
   oft-repeated account may give Urner too much credit as a direct
   democracy pioneer, it also neglects an important transatlantic socialist
   utopian strand in nineteenth-century radical political thought that
   shaped Urner's thought and played a critical role in the earliest
   efforts to promote direct democracy in both the United States and
   Europe. Direct legislation appealed to utopian socialists because it
   offered a way not only to enact desired economic change by combatting
   concentrated economic power but also to institutionalize the radical
   vision of democracy at the heart of utopian socialist thought.},

Abstract = {The study focuses on a hard-to-reach and relatively little-studied group
   that largely determines the configuration of wealth inequality in Russia
   today- the super-rich Russian businessmen. n. The object of the study
   are businessmen who have appeared on the Forbes lists from 2004 to 2021.
   Based on the analysis of the specially collected empirical database, e,
   the composition of the group by key socio-economic and demographic
   indicators is analyzed, d, its changes in the course of Russia's modern
   history are traced, and the overall dynamics of the group are assessed.
   d. The high degree of stability of this group is demonstrated, d, as
   well as the high degree of internal inequality within it. Differences in
   the two sub-groups of the super-rich- those who entered the labor market
   in the pre-reform and post-reform periods- are identified. d. It is
   shown that these differences highlight the gradual changes taking place
   in this group. p. However, r, even today the pre-reform super-rich
   dominate the group and therefore determine its generalized portrait. t.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article presents an original account of the strategic options
   available to political parties in the form of the position, salience and
   rhetoric framework. It builds upon existing accounts of party
   competition by conceiving of rhetorical justification as a distinct tool
   in the armoury of party strategists alongside the manipulation of policy
   position and issue salience. It applies that framework to the case of
   post-devolution Scotland via a quantitative text analysis of the written
   record of First Ministers Questions sessions in the Scottish Parliament.
   It shows how the main political parties in Scotland between them
   utilised all of the strategic tools contained within the PSR framework
   in the early twenty-first century up to the most recent 2021 election to
   the Holyrood parliament. It argues that the tactical choices the main
   Scottish parties made within this framework can help explain the
   differing electoral fortunes experienced by those parties in the
   post-devolution era.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the design and negotiations of the National Recovery
   and Resilience Plans (NRRPs) which the EU member states were required to
   formulate so as to access the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). By
   focusing on three Eurozone members (Austria, Greece, and Slovakia) which
   represent distinct voices and experiences within the EU integration
   project, we argue that a new form of conditionality, coordinative
   conditionality, can be identified. While this conditionality shares many
   features with previous conditionality forms, it is also unique as it
   results from what has been described as coordinative Europeanisation,
   namely early coordination between the EU and member states; informal
   channels of communication alongside formal negotiations; and a
   heightened salience of ownership by national governments. We argue that
   although evidence of coordinative Europeanisation can be found during
   the design and negotiation of the NRRPs in all three countries, the
   intensity of conditionality's different aspects is mediated by the
   credibility of a given member state's government.},

Title = {When is grassroots lobbying effective? The case of the e-petitions at
   the national level in the UK},
Journal = {INTEREST GROUPS \& ADVOCACY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {The article examines the effectiveness of one technique of grassroots
   lobbying (e-petitions) in the UK through the prism of: (1) the claim
   that the goal of lobbying activity (the change versus protection of the
   status quo policy) is a great predictor of lobbying's outcome; (2) the
   signalling theory; (3) the amended version of the economic theory of
   political information. In the paper, I studied the petitions signed by
   at least 10,000 citizens submitted to the House of Commons during the
   57th Parliament of the UK (2017-2019) and analysed their effectiveness.
   I also measured the petitions' issue salience for the ruling party (the
   Conservative Party) from the perspective of the analysed theories. The
   research results indicate the following: (1) e-petitions aiming to
   defend the status quo policy were considerably more effective than the
   ones striving to change it; (2) the scale of e-petition's endorsement
   was not a crucial factor in determining the authorities' decision,
   contradicting the assumption of the signalling theory; (3) moderately
   and highly popular lower salience issue e-petitions showed equal
   ineffectiveness. On the other hand, greatly popular higher salience
   issue e-petitions supported by the ruling party were less effective than
   their less popular counterparts. Conversely, e-petitions on higher
   salience issues opposed by the ruling party, whether moderately or
   widely endorsed by the public, exhibited equal ineffectiveness. These
   results mean that the economic theory of political information only
   partially explains the effectiveness of grassroots lobbying (i.e. in the
   last case). In conclusion, e-petitions represent a relatively efficient
   grassroots lobbying technique for influencing authorities in the UK,
   with approximately one in five being considered effective.},

Abstract = {The importance and impact of feminist mobilization across borders is
   well documented, but the impact of autonomy as an aspect of such
   organizing has not been explored in the transnational context. We argue
   that to understand the impact of transnational feminist mobilization, at
   least two distinct types of feminist mobilization require further
   conceptual development and empirical exploration in the transnational
   context, namely, autonomous as contrasted with multilateral
   mobilization. We offer a conceptual framework for distinguishing and
   studying these two forms. Further, using a mixed-methods study design,
   we empirically distinguish domestic and transnational dimensions of
   feminist activism and illuminate the impact of both multilateral
   feminist organizing and autonomous feminist organizing in the
   transnational space. Our analysis reveals that domestic and
   transnational organizing are distinct but related phenomena. We also
   find that in online organizing spaces, autonomous feminist campaigns
   amplify the messaging of geographically dispersed grassroots and
   individual activists more than multilateral ones. It further suggests
   that autonomous movements may offer more potential for representing
   marginalized groups of women, though this potential may not always be
   realized. The paper offers new concepts and empirical insights for the
   study of transnational feminism, thereby enabling a new research agenda.
   Further, this research contributes to the study of the ways that
   Transnational Social Movements can enrich global civil society and
   deepen global democracy.},

Abstract = {To what extent do peers affect criminal behavior? In this article, I
   study peer effects among ex-combatants in Colombia. Following a
   theoretical framework that differentiates the impact of economic
   conditions from that of social networks, I rely on individual-level data
   on over 16,000 former paramilitaries in Colombia to study the
   relationship between illegal gold production and recidivism. I show that
   when the economic benefits of illegal sectors increase, ex-combatants
   favor criminal activities. More importantly, I show that an increase in
   wartime peers' criminality increases an ex-combatant's criminal
   activity. I complement these results with the analysis of an original
   survey about the social connections of ex-combatants and explore the
   potential effect of tackling wartime networks as a policy to reduce
   crime after conflicts.},

Abstract = {Civic associations are expected to foster civic, pro-social behavior,
   but this optimistic view is increasingly contested. We argue that
   populist radical right parties can strategically target and infiltrate
   associations to diffuse anti-establishment rhetoric and anti-democratic
   attitudes. We illustrate this phenomenon by examining the relationship
   between civic associations and compliance with government rules during
   Germany's first Covid-19 lockdown with a difference-in-differences
   design. Results show that areas with denser sport, nature, and culture
   clubs recorded higher mobility under lockdown. We document the
   infiltration mechanism and the spreading of anti-democratic attitudes
   within associations, using survey and election data and qualitative
   evidence including interviews. In doing so, we shed light on a negative
   effect of social networks and an understudied strategy of challenger
   populist parties.},

Abstract = {Benchmarking theories argue voters use information about other
   countries' performances, usually on the economy and obtained through
   experience or media, to evaluate their own governments. Yet existing
   observational evidence is relatively fragile and struggles to
   distinguish how people become more knowledgeable. Using a pre-registered
   experiment, we showed UK respondents a chart displaying the UK's
   exceptionally high cumulative COVID-19 deaths either in isolation or
   alongside European countries with fewer deaths. Mimicking
   widely-circulated charts, this visual treatment enhances our study's
   external validity and tests the media-based channel for benchmarking.
   Aligned with pre-registered expectations, seeing the UK as ``worst of
   the bunch{''} compared to UK-only data caused more negative government
   evaluations. Unexpectedly, partisanship did not moderate the information
   effects, while exploratory tests revealed the visuals generated more
   negative evaluations among respondents with high political trust. Our
   study shows international comparisons in visual forms can change
   domestic opinion, and on matters beyond strictly economic performance.},

Abstract = {This article responds to four critics of Democracy in Spite of the Demos
   and reiterates its central thesis. Christopher Holman and Th \&
   eacute;ophile P \& eacute;nigaud attempt to maintain the critical value
   of democracy by invoking different elements of the deliberative
   tradition, while Benjamin Schupmann answers my charges by appealing to a
   strong liberal constitutionalism. I argue that these attempts repeat the
   ambivalence described and criticized in the book: democracy is taken as
   an end in itself, but with asterisks that introduce conditions and
   qualifications. As long as democracy is only desirable given certain
   caveats, the critical weight is placed on these caveats and not on the
   figure of democracy. Andrew Norris takes a different approach,
   interrogating the book's use of ideology critique and the concept of
   ``socially necessary delusion.{''} This intervention presents
   difficulties to the concluding suggestion of the book, but I maintain
   that that these difficulties can be productive and generative rather
   than limiting or prohibitive.},

Abstract = {Research on the activities and influence of interest groups in state
   legislatures faces a data problem: we are missing a comprehensive,
   systematic dataset of interest groups' policy preferences on state
   legislation. We address this gap by introducing the Dataset on Policy
   Choice and Organizational Representation in the United States (CHORUS).
   This dataset compiles over 13 million policy positions stated by tens of
   thousands of interest groups and individuals on bills in 17 state
   legislatures over the past 25 years. We describe the process used to
   construct CHORUS and present a new network science technique for
   analyzing policy position data from interest groups: the layered
   stochastic block model, which groups similar interest groups and bills
   together, respectively, based on patterns in the policy positions.
   Through two demonstrative applications, we show the utility of these
   data, combined with our novel analytical approach, for understanding
   interest group configurations in different state legislatures and policy
   areas.},

Abstract = {During moments of hegemonic crisis, it is crucial to understand the
   dynamics of media power. This article identifies key structural forces
   and disruptive tendencies that are factors in a current crisis of the
   neoliberal hegemonic order. This intellectual background underpins an
   empirical analysis of Twitter data collected during the UN climate
   summit in Glasgow, Scotland (COP26). We identify large attention
   clusters around established political actors and their counter-hegemonic
   challengers; concluding that during these intense global political
   events a hegemonic crisis produces spaces where systemically
   marginalized actors can harness relational attention power and mobilize
   it toward distinct political purposes.},

Title = {Preferences for growth strategies in advanced democracies: A new
   `representation gap'?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {156-180},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {While research on the economic characteristics of growth models across
   countries is now extensive, research on their politics is in its
   infancy, even though governments routinely pursue different strategies
   to generate growth. In particular, we lack evidence on (1) whether
   citizens have coherent preferences towards growth strategies, (2) what
   growth strategies citizens prefer and (3) what shapes their preferences.
   We address these questions through a new survey of public opinion in
   Germany, Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom, which exemplify different
   economic models. We find that preferences for growth strategies are
   consistent with other policy preferences and are meaningfully structured
   by class, retirement status, and to a lesser extent, sector of
   employment. At the same time, differences across class and sector are
   small, and a large majority of respondents across countries favour
   wage-led growth. This hints at a possible `representation gap' since
   this growth strategy is in crisis everywhere.},

Abstract = {Opposition parties are a key feature of parliamentary democracies, but
   their participation rights differ markedly. In the UK House of Commons,
   the institutional operation of the Westminster model facilitates a
   marked distinction between the rights afforded to the Official
   Opposition party compared to smaller opposition parties. During times of
   crisis, these Westminster model dynamics can shift, impacting opposition
   rights. This article uses a case study of the COVID-19 pandemic to
   assess institutional inequalities across opposition party groups.
   Drawing on an analysis of over 4000 contributions to parliamentary
   debates and interviews with MPs, we examine the pandemic's impact on the
   roles of opposition parties beyond the Official Opposition. We find that
   the pandemic initially generated unprecedented cooperation between the
   government and small opposition parties but that this was short-lived.
   In the long term, the pandemic exacerbated existing institutional
   barriers and the size and geographical concentration of small opposition
   parties in the devolved nations brought disproportionate participation
   and oversight barriers. This suggests the need to guarantee formal
   opposition rights within Westminster systems beyond the Official
   Opposition party to ensure that all political parties have the capacity
   to carry out their functions during times of crisis.},

Title = {Welfare at the Statehouse Democracies: Assessing the Impact of Public
   Opinion on Welfare Policies at the State Level},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {52},
Number = {5},
Pages = {565-578},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A frequent question in discussions about democracy is whether input from
   the public is ever considered and to what extent by politicians. This
   influence of public opinion on the realm of welfare policies has not
   been extensively explored, and most analyses are less precise for being
   conducted before the passage of the national welfare reform in 1996,
   better known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity
   Reconciliation Act (PRWORA). Bringing the analysis to a period after the
   reform to account for contextual changes since its passage, this study
   uses the multilevel and poststratification (MRP) model considered
   superior in analysis of subnational opinion using national survey data
   to assess the influence of public opinion on welfare policies at the
   state level. Collecting data from the 2014 CCES and a new developed
   welfare generosity index, I find that public opinion does not have any
   influence on how generous welfare programs turn out in their states,
   unless it is interacted with state government ideology. It seems that
   the ideology of the state government and the state poverty rate are the
   major determinants on welfare policies outcomes in the states, although
   the latter had different effects for TANF and SNAP.},

Month = {MAY-AUG},
Abstract = {This contribution is devoted to Severino's debt to the Hegelian
   dialectic. First, it critically introduces the key-elements of the
   Hegelian dialectic of Wesenheiten - which Severino pays close attention
   to in the central chapters of his main text, La struttura originaria. In
   particular, this introduction distinguishes, and then relates, the
   concepts of ``dialectical contradiction{''} and ``formal
   contradiction{''}. Second, the contribution analyzes the chapters in
   which Severino enhances, in his own way, the Hegelian ``determinate
   negation{''}. This formula is taken up by Severino to indicate that
   opposition between contrary meanings that establishes the organism of
   entities. Third, the contribution analyzes the concepts of
   ``organicism{''} and ``absolute relationalism{''}, which should be kept
   clearly separated, but which Severino - in fact - welds together,
   resulting in aporetic outcomes.},

Abstract = {Precision strike has assumed an outsized role in modern warfare. In the
   First Drone Age, drone-based precision strike promises to deliver
   accurate, first-time hits. Some assert that drone-based precision strike
   and precision strike-based strategies appear to offer a more civilised
   and antiseptic method of waging war. Amos C Fox argues that the
   Precision Paradox is a cautionary heuristic to illustrate the potential
   shortcomings of precision strategies, thereby allowing decision-makers
   to incorporate a modicum of realism into their thinking. The Precision
   Paradox also helps to illustrate the need to return to military thought
   rooted in realism and reason, instead of military thought based on
   linear, best-case scenario suppositions.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the meso level impact of an academic development
   programme on internationalisation. We demonstrate the relevance of the
   framework of grassroots leadership in higher education in the Central
   European context and show how individual programme participants acting
   as grassroots leaders influence departmental attitudes and practices
   regarding internationalisation and student-centred learning. We identify
   two successful strategies-single-issue and multifaceted-for grassroots
   leadership. The study finds that established faculty member participants
   who are also active as grassroots leaders facilitate the spreading of
   the influence of an internationalisation programme beyond the individual
   level, highlighting the differences and similarities in the activism of
   faculty grassroots leaders in Central Europe vis-\& agrave;-vis the USA.},

Abstract = {Research consistently demonstrates that differences between the policy
   preferences of high- and low-income individuals are surprisingly small,
   at least at the aggregate level. We depart from this work by considering
   the size of income-based differences in opinion within political
   parties. To do so, we use responses to 144 policy-specific questions in
   the 2010-2020 Cooperative Election Study (CES). Our effort demonstrates
   that differences in opinion among the rich and poor tend to be larger
   within the parties than in the overall population. Interestingly, these
   gaps are largest among Democrats. We find that these larger gaps persist
   even after accounting for the party's racial and ethnic diversity.
   Furthermore, among Democrats, class-based gaps in opinion are larger
   than the gaps we observe among other potential intraparty cleavages,
   such as age, gender, and religiosity. Our results suggest important
   implications for the growing literature on representational inequality.},

Abstract = {Politicians' ability to provide national security to the public is
   deeply enmeshed in conceptions of the state and of leadership. This
   article incorporates securitization, feminist, and political
   communication theories to consider whether gendered and militarized
   conceptions of national security have different effects for politicians
   who are women and those who are men. Although scholarship suggests that
   signaling military bona fides-such as invoking one's veteran status-can
   help politicians claim that certain policies are a matter of national
   security, we consider whether this ability will be gendered. Relying on
   two national studies, we find results that are contrary to our original
   predictions. First, we find that military bona fides do help women be
   seen as leaders. However, we do not find evidence that bona fides
   increase the ``authority{''} to identify and address national security
   threats for any politicians.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how a district administration in Bangladesh
   managed COVID-19 pandemic risk governance. Interviews were conducted
   with civil administrators, local government representatives, and
   representatives from community-based organizations and nongovernmental
   organizations. The findings indicate that, despite limited health
   facilities, widespread ignorance of the virus, joblessness among wage
   earners, economic pressure, and a massive outbreak of COVID-19, the
   district administration has demonstrated its diligence, professionalism,
   local knowledge, and promptness in providing optimal public services
   through coordination and information sharing among all stakeholders. The
   synergies and coordination between local administration, security
   forces, and local government representatives were great challenges in
   implementing nonpharmaceutical polices and support programs.},

Abstract = {Coalition policymaking concerns not only who decides what in which
   jurisdiction but also when, how speedy and in what rhythm. Due to the
   limited time budget and shadow of future elections, parties in charge of
   respective ministerial portfolios have to strategically organize their
   policy agendas to trade off between policy and electoral incentives in
   the face of coalition partners who monitor and control ministerial
   autonomy. However, despite the burgeoning literature on coalition
   governance, the temporal dimension of ministerial agenda control is less
   well understood. I advance this research by proposing a model to
   directly account for the influence of time budgets on timing decisions
   of ministers in policy initiation. In this model, I distinguish between
   different timing strategies of policy initiation a ministerial party may
   possibly adopt and identify in equilibrium a conditional postponing
   strategy by which ministers facing high scrutiny of coalition partners
   will postpone bill initiation till the end of the term. The empirical
   examination lends support to my argument and further demonstrates that
   the timing strategy of ministers can also be influenced by coalition
   conflict and policy saliency of bills.},

Abstract = {Adverse experiences and risk-taking behavior in adolescent life have
   been found to influence the willingness to support violence or adopt
   extremist ideology. The objective of this study was to explore how
   experienced discrimination, delinquency, and mental well-being
   influenced support for ideological violence, and to what extent social
   support moderated this influence. This research utilized data from a
   large-sample study (N = 2588) of Norwegian youth and young adults
   recruited from upper-secondary schools and follow-up services. Through
   two multiple regression analyses, both discrimination and delinquency
   were identified to increase the willingness to support violence.
   However, social support from friends or close family members moderated
   the effect of these factors on the willingness to support violence and
   reduced the willingness to support violence itself. To understand how
   social support facilitates this influence, future research should
   examine more specifically the quality and quantity of social
   relationships. This can lead to a deeper understanding of how social
   support (1) interacts with risk factors and (2) possibly how social
   support can be harnessed and operationalized in prevention and
   intervention programs aimed at reducing extremist attitudes.},

Abstract = {This article argues that unless the African Continental Free Trade Area
   (AfCFTA) departs from the old ways of doing things, free trade will not
   automatically enable Africa to tackle the various trade constraints
   hampering intra-African trade as a result of the enormous challenges
   that will confront it. To ensure that AfCFTA is not an `old wine in a
   new bottle,' there is a need for a paradigm shift to move from
   top-bottom to bottom-top, inter-governmental to inter-people,
   inter-state to people-to-people, state-centric to human-centred and
   public sector led to private sector-driven integration. The role of the
   state at the onset should be facilitative and complementary. This should
   serve as a recipe for massive cross-border business integration and
   autonomy of the continental free trade area. By relying solely on
   secondary data, this study is essentially a desktop study and,
   therefore, it is basically qualitative, analytical, theoretical and
   descriptive.},

Abstract = {Nationalists believed that Ireland had not thrived economically under
   the Union. This article explores economic policymaking under the 1922
   Provisional Government which administered the 26 counties during the
   one-year transition phase from British to Irish Free State jurisdiction.
   It is a case study which examines the fate of pre-independence economic
   programmes; the reorganisation of the economic portfolios of the civil
   service; the handling of immediate economic problems; as well as the
   formulation of plans and priorities for Ireland's future. The
   Provisional Government faced an unprecedented array of internal and
   external problems, in particular the economic depression and deflation
   in the wake of the First World War (1914-1918); the economic damage of
   the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921); and the divisive and violent
   Irish Civil War (1922-3) - the result of rupture in the main nationalist
   political party, Sinn F \& eacute;in, over acceptance of the Anglo-Irish
   Treaty settlement, which provided for the creation of the Irish Free
   State as a dominion rather than as a fully sovereign republic. Depspite
   these setbacks, the Provisional Government needed to enforce its
   authority and demonstrate its ability to govern by being seen to
   competently address economic issues.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines the racial formation theory proposed by
   Omi and Winant from a Marxist perspective. It contends that the theory
   overlooks the class dimension of the social construction of race and the
   dynamics of racial formation in the United States. The article traces
   the historical role of class in the process of racial formation and
   shows how race and racism are linked to the evolution of capitalism in
   American society. It argues that the colonial ruling class created race
   and used racism as a tool to fragment the labouring class along racial
   and ethnic lines, preventing them from uniting against the colonial
   capitalist system. The invention of race set the stage for the
   persistence and reinforcement of race formation and racism by the
   subsequent American ruling class from post-independence to the present
   day. This article also challenges the idea of a racial state and asserts
   that it is a false concept that fails to capture the reality of racism
   and its solutions. It concludes that the theory is inadequate, biased,
   and ineffective in addressing and resolving the issues of race and
   racism in the social and everyday lives of the oppressed minorities in
   the United States.},

Abstract = {The decline in local newspapers is leading to a local news `desert',
   where there is little or no coverage of important local issues like
   policing, court cases and council politics. At present, the BBC attempts
   to fill some of the gap by paying for `local democracy reporters' who
   work for private local media companies, but this creates tensions and is
   not a sustainable solution. This article argues that granting small
   local media organisations charitable status, as in the United States,
   would also be problematic. Instead, it advocates an independent `Local
   Press Council'.},

Abstract = {Broadcasting in Northern Ireland reflects the abiding influence of
   conflict between the nationalist and unionist communities and the
   perception of Northern Ireland as a place somewhat apart. Decisions
   about broadcast content are made in an environment where each community
   expects to see itself and can be disturbed to find the other. But there
   are other communities, as well as many people, who do not think in
   binary terms. Broadcasting needs to respond to that and to the changing
   demography, with its more varied and nuanced views. BBCNI lacks both the
   governance and the resources to respond to this challenge. Key decisions
   are made in London, where the task ahead is not well understood and
   priorities can appear oriented towards a different audience.},

Abstract = {Across the world, public service media faces a legion of simultaneous
   threats-to its funding, its distribution, its value and its
   independence. These threats come at a time when the fundamental purpose
   of public service media-to provide high quality, verified, and impartial
   news and information-could not be more consequential. As our digital
   spaces become epistemological junkyards, cluttered with bot-inflated,
   AI-generated text and clickbait content, so the public need for stable,
   grounded and verified media intensifies. In such a chaotic information
   environment, one might have expected that the UK government would
   enhance its commitment to public service media. Instead, successive UK
   governments have undermined its sustainability, reputation and future.},

   variation, I show that the places from which more casualties come have
   systematically lower levels of tax morale. I argue that these results
   arise because there has been no clear break with the authoritarian past
   in Romania, and many citizens still associate the current political
   elites with the former communist rulers who perpetrated the violence of
   December 1989.},

Abstract = {Legislative committees have recently received inadequate attention in
   the available interjurisdictional literature. This article in the 2024
   Policy Studies Yearbook, published by Politics \& Policy, reviews
   legislative committee data categories, methods, and the distribution of
   authorship to explore how legislative committee research has fared
   between 2010 and 2023. This review article establishes that since 2010,
   research on committee structure has been dominated by U.S. congressional
   theories and how to test them in noncongressional settings. The dominant
   aspect of legislative organization across the five reviewed themes is
   the selection of committee members, an essential aspect of understanding
   power dynamics in modern legislatures. As survey methods and case
   studies have increased, the archival analysis methods have decreased,
   indicating an increasing turn to first-hand primary data in analyzing
   the internal organization of committees. There is also a growing trend
   toward greater collaboration among scholars.},

Abstract = {This article empirically investigates the impact of globalization on
   voting behavior. Specifically, combining individual-level data from the
   first nine waves of the European Social Survey, party-level information
   from the Comparative Manifesto Project, and country-level data from
   Eurostat, we study the individual determinants of the vote for trade
   protectionist parties. Our findings show, firstly, that protectionist
   parties mainly receive electoral support from less-educated voters,
   unemployed individuals, and members of labor unions. Secondly, we test
   the compensation principle using a macro measure of a country's
   compensation potential and find, contrary to expectations, no
   significant evidence that a greater potential to mitigate the labor
   market adjustment costs resulting from economic openness deters the
   propensity to vote for protectionist parties in national elections.},

Abstract = {This article critiques policies aimed at income redistribution within
   the framework of Marx's critique of political economy. The `Neoliberal'
   characterization of capitalist history, the tendency to divide
   capitalism into distinct sub-periods or phases, continues to play a
   significant role for describing changes to social policy in the United
   States. Prominent academics and public intellectuals continue to hold
   spirited debates over whether or not welfare spending in the United
   States has become less generous over the years, owing to increasing
   `neoliberalization' of the American economy. This mixed-methods research
   paper analyzes trends in social welfare spending and income inequality
   for the United States. To supplement the analysis, a novel dataset on
   Distributional National Accounts from the Bureau of Economic Analysis is
   also analyzed. Evidence suggests previous concerns in the literature are
   unfounded and are not borne out by empirical evidence.},

Abstract = {Non-compliance with compulsory military service as a form of homeland
   defence (i.e. conscription) is typically justified by various types of
   conscientious objections. However, in this article, I offer an
   alternative type of justification that is based on the common good. To
   achieve this, I present the concept of the common good and its
   relationship to the political obligation of homeland defence from the
   perspective of different traditions of political thought. Subsequently,
   I outline two types of exceptions to this political obligation: the
   liberal type of exceptions and the membership-based ones.},

Abstract = {Approval of the Supreme Court recently hit its lowest point in decades.
   Calls for reforming the Court have gained traction as a result. In this
   study, we look at how media framing can influence public support for two
   specific reforms: Court packing and term limits. In a survey experiment,
   we provide respondents with either a pro-, anti-, or mixed-valence
   framed message about one of these two reforms. We find support for the
   proposition that media messages have the power to decrease support for
   reform but not to increase support for reform. Additionally, we theorize
   that highlighting the conflict surrounding the Court activates
   ideological considerations individuals hold toward the Court. In support
   of this theory, we find that discussing either Court packing or term
   limits decreases specific support of the high Court among Democrats and
   increases specific support among Republicans across all conditions.},

Abstract = {We revise the conventional wisdom that Africa's international borders
   were drawn arbitrarily. Europeans knew very little about most of Africa
   in the mid-1880s, but their self-interested goals of amassing territory
   prompted intensive examination of on-the-ground conditions as they
   formed borders. Europeans negotiated with African rulers to secure
   treaties and to learn about historical state frontiers, which enabled
   Africans to influence the border-formation process. Major water bodies,
   which shaped precolonial civilizations and trade, also served as focal
   points. We find support for these new theoretical implications using two
   original datasets. Quantitatively, we analyze border-location correlates
   using grid cells and an original spatial dataset on precolonial states.
   Qualitatively, we compiled information from treaties and diplomatic
   histories to code causal process observations for every bilateral
   border. Historical political frontiers directly affected 62\% of all
   bilateral borders. Water bodies, often major ones, comprised the primary
   border feature much more frequently than straight lines.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine individual- and state-level voter confidence
   in Georgia from 2020 to 2022-an extremely contentious moment in Georgia
   politics. For the first time in 28 years, Georgia's electoral votes went
   to a Democrat, Joe Biden, in 2020. Then, in early January 2021,
   Democrats won both of Georgia's two U.S. Senate runoffs, giving their
   party majority control. In the wake of these surprising, historic, and
   consequential losses, Georgia Republicans' voter confidence plummeted,
   and their party responded by passing comprehensive electoral reform in
   Senate Bill (SB) 202. Using survey data, we tracked voter confidence in
   Georgia before and after 2020, after passage of SB 202 in 2021, and
   after the 2022 midterm. Partisans' voter confidence is greatly affected
   by the winner/loser effect in election outcomes. Also, SB 202 did boost
   Republicans' confidence in Georgia's election system, which, in turn,
   increased their individual- and state-level voter confidence in the 2022
   midterm. In contrast, Georgia Democrats overwhelmingly opposed SB 202;
   therefore, the bill did not have the same salutary effect on their voter
   confidence in the 2022 elections.},

Abstract = {This analysis examines the economic relationship between T \& uuml;rkiye
   and the GCC countries, focusing notably on the economic and trade ties.
   It argues that while mutual relations have increased during the AK Party
   era, historical commercial relations have been subject to fluctuations
   due to regional and foreign policy preferences. Descriptive analysis
   using secondary data supports this claim. Cointegration techniques are
   also employed to empirically analyze the trade relationship between the
   two sides from 1994 to 2020. The results indicate long-term
   cointegration in T \& uuml;rkiye-GCC economic relations, with bilateral
   trade positively affected in the long-term. However, the findings also
   suggest that as GCC countries' exports to T \& uuml;rkiye increase, T \&
   uuml;rkiye's exports to the GCC increase even more over the long-term.},

Journal = {INSIGHT TURKEY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Turkish-Bahraini bilateral ties provide a fertile ground for a
   comprehensive set of discussions on regional affairs, yet it is an
   understudied topic with little work done on these bilateral ties. This
   research aims to fulfill a valid gap in the Gulf studies literature by
   describing the Bahraini foreign policy dynamics in its relations with T
   \& uuml;rkiye. In this respect, the purpose is to answer two questions:
   What are the major national role types that Bahrain accommodates in the
   contemporary Middle East system in conducting foreign policymaking
   towards T \& uuml;rkiye? How does Bahrain's role conceptions towards T
   \& uuml;rkiye work under a sub-regional Saudi hegemony? There has been
   continuous, solid, yet limited diplomatic communication between Bahrain
   and T \& uuml;rkiye. With a hybrid use of post-structural discourse
   theory and role theory the nature of the emerging ties is elaborated,
   focusing on the Bahraini foreign affairs. This research proposes that
   there are two dynamics in the Bahraini foreign policymaking towards T \&
   uuml;rkiye: a faithful ally of Saudi Arabia and strategic role
   adaptation. These roles are either played simultaneously, as is the case
   in the peak years of cooperation with T \& uuml;rkiye, or being a
   faithful ally of Saudi Arabia dominates Bahrain's strategic role
   adaptations, notably in the times of crises.},

Abstract = {The Western Balkans region holds vital strategic importance for
   transatlantic security. Following the collapse of the Former Yugoslavia,
   the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
   (NATO) have actively contributed to regional stability both in the form
   of peace missions and through offering the regional countries
   integration prospects with the transatlantic structures. Amidst years of
   enlargement fatigue, Russias' invasion of Ukraine has underlined the
   significance of the integration of the Western Balkans into the
   transatlantic institutions. This article examines the recent
   developments in the Western Balkans and analyzes the prospects for the
   Euro-Atlantic integration of the regional countries.},

Abstract = {The theory of << demoicracy >> challenges the capacity of the normative
   frameworks of classical democracy to judge the democratic legitimacy of
   the EU's political system. << Demoicracy >> makes the different peoples
   or demoi of the member states and European citizens as a whole the
   normative subjects of its theory, standing as a transnational third way
   between sovereignism and supranationalism, as both link democracy to the
   existence of a single demos. The questions guiding this article are: is
   `demoicracy' a genuine alternative to classical theories of European
   integration, and can `demoicracy' explain the European Union's recent
   legitimation strategies? After a thorough analysis of the normative
   foundations and development of the theory, it is argued that <<
   demoicracy >> does not provide an alternative to classical theories of
   European integration and is not able to explain recent EU legitimation
   strategies (in particular, deliberative innovations such as the European
   Citizens' Panels). In any case, << demoicracy >> is useful in
   highlighting that the debate on democratic legitimacy in the EU must
   also point to relations between member states and between member states
   and the EU itself.},

Abstract = {The role of associations in political life is a long-standing interest
   for American political theorists. Typically, a vibrant associational
   life is understood to support democratic institutions and guard against
   tyranny. Another function, one that has received increased philosophical
   attention, is the space associations provide for marginalized groups to
   furnish distinct concepts and vocabularies capable of capturing their
   members' experiences of oppression. However, in this article, I draw on
   James Baldwin's reflections regarding the rising popularity of the
   Nation of Islam, to argue that philosophers should not overlook either
   the deleterious effects of injustice on people's capacities, even when
   aggregated into associations, to effectively capture the realities of
   their oppression or the complex ways in which even morally repugnant
   hermeneutical resources can usefully serve an association's practical
   causes. It is therefore necessary to develop additional, more ambivalent
   evaluative standards to capture the complex knot of epistemic and
   political functions associations perform.},

Abstract = {A growing consensus indicates that increasing visibility,
   awareness-raising, and positive media representations of gay people,
   through public advocacy and endorsements, contribute to tolerance and
   support. In particular, existing studies in the West show the promise of
   celebrity endorsements in promoting pro-gay attitudes. However, an
   emerging body of research, largely outside the West, points to potential
   backlash surrounding gay identity. We examine the efficacy of celebrity
   pro-gay endorsements. In an original survey experiment in Tbilisi,
   Georgia involving randomized pro-gay endorsements from a prominent
   Georgian football star, we find that a pro-gay celebrity endorsement
   reduces tolerance toward gay people. Our results have implications for
   the success of public messaging on gay identity in conservative social
   contexts.},

Title = {Why Do Voters Prefer Local Candidates? Evidence from a Danish Conjoint

Abstract = {Political candidates enjoy a well-documented electoral advantage near
   their place of residence. But knowing that voters prefer candidates who
   live nearby does not explain why this is the case. What inferences do
   voters make about local candidates that make them so universally
   attractive? In this study, I distinguish two well-established
   theoretical explanations in a conjoint experiment conducted in Denmark.
   Do people prefer local candidates because of in-group favoritism, or do
   voters prefer local candidates because they expect them to favor their
   local area once in office? By independently varying signals of
   candidates' (1) behavioral localism and (2) symbolic localism, I
   estimate the importance of each for voters' preferences for local
   candidates. I find that voters' preference for candidates who live
   nearby is driven in part by a preference for candidates who spend most
   of their time looking out for voters' local interests. While I also find
   that voters prefer candidates who signal their commitment to the local
   in-group, these preferences appear to be unrelated to voters' preference
   for candidates who live locally. Thus, I find that voters seem to prefer
   local candidates because of their behavioral localism, while I find no
   evidence that voters prefer local candidates because of their symbolic
   localism.},

Abstract = {Events of recent years both in the United States and around the globe
   have highlighted the fragility of democracy. The invasion of Ukraine by
   Russia has prompted educators to seek evidence-based civic engagement
   methods for helping students understand the invasion and its
   implications. This paper offers a set of recommendations on how to teach
   the war in Ukraine through the lens of civic engagement education. Over
   the years, a sizeable body of scholarship has developed addressing the
   critical role civic education plays in safeguarding democracy and
   producing effective pedagogical approaches for instilling democratic
   knowledge, skills, and dispositions. Using this scholarship as a
   starting point, this paper offers recommendations on how educators in a
   variety of settings and across disciplines might modify these civic
   learning models to address the war in Ukraine. Based on my experience as
   a scholar-practitioner-educator at an institute of politics focused
   primarily on American democracy, I also offer suggestions on how to
   integrate teaching the war in Ukraine using these practices to enhance
   appreciation of civic engagement and the role of the citizen.},

   wildfires are linked to voting},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {88},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper investigates whether wildfires are linked to increases in
   vote share for a green party in government. We argue that natural
   disasters move climate change action up on voters' agendas, consequently
   affecting electoral behavior. Making use of the impact of an intense
   wildfire season in Sweden in 2018, we analyze changes in propensity to
   vote for a green governing party after experiencing wildfires in the
   election year. The Green party's vote share is significantly larger than
   expected in affected municipalities compared to unaffected
   municipalities, with an overall effect size of about 1 percentage point
   in the national election and 1.2 percentage points in the local
   election. These effect sizes are substantial given typical green party
   vote shares. Meanwhile, the incumbent Social Democratic party appears to
   have been electorally punished for the fires. The findings contribute to
   the literature on natural disasters and climate opinion, as well as on
   the impact of local conditions on electoral behavior.},

Abstract = {Political thought has long identified demagogic leadership as one of the
   key pathologies of democracy. Unusually among political thinkers, Max
   Weber not only accepts the inevitability of demagogy in democratic
   politics but also appropriates the figure of the demagogue for
   democratic thought, praising certain kinds of `responsible' demagogic
   leadership. This paper examines the role of demagogues in democracy
   through the lens of Weber's political thought. It critically
   reconstructs Weber's view of demagogy in terms of the kind of
   representation charismatic leaders can offer. Demagogues articulate
   images of `the people' that express a group's deep values and
   identities. However, Weber worried that demagogues often act
   irresponsibly, exacerbating dangerous divisions, given their ability to
   overcome legal and normative constraints. For Weber, democracy requires
   institutions that encourage an `ethic of responsibility' in leaders
   while also holding them accountable. Weber's partial defence of demagogy
   provides useful perspectives on representation and on the institutional
   prerequisites for responsible leadership that neither deliberative nor
   minimalist models of democracy sufficiently appreciate.},

Abstract = {The electoral rise of Milei, that brought him up to the presidency of
   Argentina in 2023, has run in parallel with discussions about his use of
   populist ideas. Overall, Milei is characterised by his emphasis on
   economic issues, with an extreme pro-market position based on the
   Austrian school, but he also stands out for a strong anti-establishment
   discourse. While observers may consider these appeals as populist, a
   categorisation based on just this feature could be premature given the
   multidimensional nature of populism. This article tests the importance
   of populism in the discourse of Milei displaying an empirical strategy
   based on the holistic grading of key political discourses. Main results
   indicate that Milei's discourse is partially populist because it lacks a
   people-centred vision, even one anchored in market rationality. We
   expect these results will facilitate comparisons of the Argentinian case
   with other Latin-American cases in which populism and neoliberalism seem
   to be mutually reinforcing.},

Abstract = {Jean Blondel made many lasting contributions toward comparative
   politics, not least in his classification of party systems in Western
   democracies. Yet during the 5 decades since Blondel's original
   contribution, party competition has been transformed by multiple
   developments, including changes in the grassroots electorate, as
   intermediary organizations connecting citizens and the state, and at the
   apex in legislatures and government. Does Blondel's typology of party
   systems remain relevant today-or does it require substantial revision?
   And, does party system fragmentation predict ideological polarization?
   Part I sets out the theoretical framework. Part II compares trends from
   1960 to 2020 in party system fragmentation in a wide range of
   democracies, measured by the effective number of parties in the
   electorate and in parliament. Not surprisingly, the effective number of
   electoral parties (ENEP) has generally grown in each country across
   Western democracies. This does not imply, however, that party systems
   are necessarily more polarized ideologically. Part III examines
   polarization in party systems across Western democracies, measured by
   standard deviations around the mean of several ideological values and
   issue positions in each country. The findings suggest that party system
   fractionalization and polarization should be treated as two distinct and
   unrelated dimensions of party competition. The conclusion reflects on
   the broader implications of the findings for understanding party
   polarization and threats of backsliding in democratic states.},

Abstract = {In 2020, Arizonans approved Proposition 207, the Smart and Safe Arizona
   Act, which legalized recreational marijuana sales. Previous research has
   typically used non-spatial survey data to understand marijuana
   legalization voting patterns. However, voting behavior can, in part, be
   shaped by geographic context, or place, which is unaccounted for in
   aspatial survey data. We use multiscale geographically weighted
   regression to analyze how place shaped Proposition 207 voting behavior,
   independently of demographic variations across space. We find
   significant spatial variability in the sensitivity of voting for
   Proposition 207 to changes in several of the predictor variables of
   opposition and support for recreational marijuana legalization. We argue
   that local statistical modeling approaches provide a more in-depth
   understanding of ballot measure voting behavior than the current use of
   global models.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is to examine the impact of urbanization
   and civil conflicts on the severity of food insecurity for a panel of 43
   African countries over the period 2000-2020. Subsequently, the
   heterogeneous choice models approach was used for the estimations. The
   results show that urbanization and civil conflict increase food
   insecurity. The parallel line probability hypothesis results
   specifically show that a one-unit increase in urban growth rate
   increases the probability of belonging to a high-risk food insecurity
   category by more than .6 times. Furthermore, the results show that the
   impacts of urbanization on food insecurity are modulated by civil
   conflicts in Africa leading to the net effect of .692. This corresponds
   to the policy threshold of 2.315 when the net positive effect is
   canceled out. Therefore, this study strongly recommends the need for
   African economies to develop urban agriculture while controlling the
   pace of urbanization in order to reduce food insecurity and avoid
   possible civil wars.},

Abstract = {Recent research advancing our understanding of partisan cognitive
   differences finds symmetrical partisan routes to epistemic hubris:
   intellectual identity and anti-intellectual affect. These researchers
   conclude that epistemic hubris is largely due to intellectual identity
   among Democrats and anti-intellectual affect among Republicans. I
   investigate whether these relationships are purely due to a greater
   prevalence of intellectual identity among Democrats and
   anti-intellectual affect among Republicans or if these constructs are
   particularly potent in producing epistemic hubris among those who
   identify with their associated parties. I present observational evidence
   that partisanship conditions the influence of anti-intellectual affect
   on epistemic hubris but do not find that partisanship conditions the
   influence of intellectual identity. Based on these findings, we can
   expect Red America's increasing anti-intellectualism to contribute to
   increasing epistemic hubris. More broadly, I provide empirical support
   for understanding intellectual identity and anti-intellectualism as
   distinct concepts based on their differing relationships with other
   fundamental political concepts.},

Title = {Comparative analysis of gendered frames in far-right rhetoric in the
   West},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 9},
Abstract = {This research delves into the examination of gender frames within a
   number of far-right platforms, such as American Renaissance, Heritage
   and Destiny, Britain First, Daily Stormer, and Front Page Magazine. Our
   primary objective is to dissect the construction of gendered frames and
   their consequential roles within the broader far-right political and
   ideological landscapes in the West. Employing a mixed-method approach,
   we scrutinize English language material from the aforementioned online
   platforms. This study argues that despite differences among these
   platforms, the representations of women's roles and identities are
   consistently shaped and moulded in alignment with overarching political
   and ideological perspectives such as racism, Islamophobia, antisemitism,
   anti-immigration, anti-feminism, anti-left, and anti-media. These
   perspectives serve as amplifiers, further contributing gendered frames.
   Ultimately, this dynamic process of constructing gendered frames
   contributes to the development of far-right identities, drawing distinct
   demarcation lines between `us' and `them'.},

Abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a natural process where microbes
   develop the ability to survive the antimicrobial drugs we depend upon to
   treat and prevent deadly infections, such as antibiotics. This
   microscopic evolution is further propelled by human activities, where
   each use of an antimicrobial drug potentially induces AMR. As microbes
   can spread quickly from animals to humans and travel around the world
   through humanity's global circuits of movement, the use of any
   antimicrobial drug has potentially global consequences. As human-induced
   AMR occurs, mortality and morbidity increase due to increasingly or
   sometimes completely ineffective antimicrobial treatments. This article
   considers AMR as a product of the evolving and complex interplay between
   human societies and invisible microbial worlds. It argues that as a
   political challenge, AMR requires robust institutions that can manage
   human-microbial interactions to minimize the emergence of drug
   resistance and maximize the likelihood of achieving effective
   antimicrobial use for all. Yet, current governance systems for AMR are
   ill-equipped to meet these goals. We propose a conceptual paradigm shift
   for global AMR governance efforts, arguing that global governance could
   better address AMR if approached as a socioecological problem in need of
   sustainable management rather than solely as a medical problem to be
   solved. In biodiversity governance, institutions are designed to fit the
   biological features of the ecosystems that they are attempting to
   manage. We consider how a similar approach can improve global AMR
   governance. Employing the concept of ecological fit, which is defined as
   the alignment between human social systems and biological ecosystems, we
   diagnose 18 discrepancies between the social institutions that currently
   govern AMR and the ecological nature of this problem. Drawing from
   lessons learned in biodiversity governance, the article proposes five
   institutional design principles for improving the fit and effectiveness
   of global AMR governance.},

Abstract = {Expectations about ethnic solidarity notwithstanding, Latino support for
   Donald Trump grew between the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.
   Despite his anti-immigration positions and policies, the number of votes
   cast for Trump unexpectedly increased among members of the group most
   strongly associated with the issue of immigration. Latinos showed
   considerably more variance in voting behavior than what would be
   expected given accounts focused mainly on their ethnic solidarity. We
   propose a counterintuitive explanation for this trend: due to the
   activation of dormant political dispositions, it is the very
   anti-immigration attitudes characterizing Trump that account for his
   ascendence among Latino voters. Latinos voting for Trump did so because
   of his anti-immigration positions and not despite those positions. Our
   findings motivate a reevaluation of standard understandings of the role
   of minorities in American politics writ large and in American elections
   more specifically. Furthermore, as anti-immigration Latinos reside
   disproportionately more in certain swing states, we find them to be a
   pivotal political force in determining election outcomes, though in
   unexpected ways.},

Title = {A meta-analysis of voter mobilization tactics by electoral salience},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {87},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {After hundreds of field experiments assessing their effectiveness, voter
   mobilization tactics are often considered ``settled science.{''} In this
   research note, we posit that this assumption is incorrect, due to
   inconsistent and insufficient attention to electoral salience in the
   literature. Researchers often conduct mobilization field experiments in
   low-salience elections due to limited resources and the need for
   adequate statistical power. However, practitioners often apply these
   findings in high-salience contexts. Theory suggests that effects of
   mobilization tactics will attenuate in high-salience elections due to
   heightened attention. We present refined meta-analytic estimates of
   common mobilization tactics in U.S. elections-canvassing, phone calls,
   direct mail, and SMS messages-based on electoral salience. Results show
   that effects of tactics attenuate 33\%-76\% from low- to highsalience
   contexts. We translate all findings into intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates
   to highlight the impact of declining contact rates. Finally, we identify
   significant gaps in the research and offer solutions.},

Title = {``Is there life after death?{''} Surviving an electoral defeat in Jordan},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2024},
Number = {147},
Abstract = {Based on the case of Jordanian MPs who failed to secure re-election in
   2020, the article proposes a contribution to the sociology of political
   defeat, analyzing both the way ex-MPs interpret their defeat and the
   effects of this event on their biographical and political careers. The
   study first explores the strategies employed by MPs to ignore their own
   responsibility in the defeat, and to convert the latter into a resource
   of political legitimacy. The study of the post-defeat period then shows
   that remaining in the political field is conditional on the possession
   of resources that can be reconverted outside Parliament. While most
   ex-MPs find themselves excluded from the political field and suffer a
   devaluation of their notability resources accumulated at local level, a
   more professionalized minority manages to remain in other political
   arenas, which they invest in the continuity of the parliamentary roles
   they have hitherto assumed within the institution.},

Title = {The Importance of a Coordinated Career Guidance System in Addressing the
   Rural NEETs Issue},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {A rapidly ageing population, the dual transition, major changes in the
   job market, and the coronavirus and its effects amplify existing
   disparities (gender gap, urban-rural cleavages), posing a considerable
   challenge for peripheral regions. In these circumstances, the labour
   market integration of young people who are neither in employment nor in
   education or training (NEET) is becoming increasingly urgent for
   peripheral regions such as rural areas. Various legislation, policies,
   and community-based interventions play a significant role in promoting
   integration. Still, subjective factors such as self-efficacy beliefs
   affect perceptions of career opportunities and can even prevent some
   from seizing opportunities. As a result, approaches to tackling the
   rural NEET issue need to focus on a long-term, sustainable solution. One
   could be career guidance, which helps individuals take charge of their
   lives and choose meaningful careers and educational paths. Consequently,
   our research aimed to identify the conditions in 22 European countries
   related to career guidance that lead to low rural NEET rates among
   25-29-year-olds. Career guidance systems were explored through content
   analysis of country-specific reports on lifelong guidance systems and
   then analysed using the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. The
   research results draw attention to the importance of coordinated career
   guidance systems in preventing and (re)integrating NEETs, as it helps
   make informed, meaningful, and long-term career decisions.},

Abstract = {This article is a collective discussion with undergraduate students
   about their work in a second-year gender studies course. The discussion
   shares how active engagement in collective art production for social
   change can provide the seeds for decolonial, anti-racist and
   anti-ableist pedagogical practice. The course encourages students to
   actively engage in the classroom, raise questions and concerns about
   social justice, and implement ways to challenge social relations of
   power. Students work collectively on projects using a range of
   alternative ways of knowing, including sensory, heart, intellectual, and
   spiritual knowledge, to connect with the course material in creative
   ways. The article is a conversation with three students in the course
   and the work they produced. They discuss the various mediums they used,
   including poetry, collaging, and a case study of artists' street art.
   The students touch on the politics of joy, self-care, heart knowledge,
   politics of suffering, and accessibility, illustrating how combining art
   with various ways of knowing has helped them develop deeply analytic,
   compassionate, and relational work for social change. The work affirms
   ways of knowing that have often evolved outside the colonial academic
   institution. The anti- racist, anti-colonial, anti-ableist, feminist and
   Indigenous pedagogies used in the course help to pluralize constructive
   capacities for more decolonizing, equitable, inclusive, anti-racist and
   expansive educational futures.},

Abstract = {Here we develop a genealogical critique about the theatricalization of

   recent Colombian reality through the figural and patriarchal concepts
   using as framework The Arnolfini portrait (1434) by the Flemish painter
   Jan Van Eyck (1390-1441) in relation to three poems by Maria Mercedes
   Carranza (Bogot \& aacute;, 1945-2003): Aqu \& iacute; con la Se \&
   ntilde;ora Arnolfini , M \& eacute;tale cabeza y El Canto de las Moscas
   . From this figural basis we understand Mrs. Arnolfini as the aesthetics
   that governs contemporary, neoliberal, and globalized art, a sterile
   politics that commodifies memory. In this regard, we incorporate the
   concept of parody by Giorgio Agamben (1942- ) to understand the place of
   the arts in the desire for Paz Total . Finally, we warn about the
   re-victimization of victims of the Colombian armed conflict by
   subjecting them to aesthetic protocols foreign to their language.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to analyze readers' comments on one of the most
   popular news websites in Mar del Plata (La Capital). The source analyzed
   consists of political news related to the former mayor and candidate for
   the coalition Cambiemos, Carlos Fernando Arroyo (2015-2019). Arroyo is a
   political figure usually linked to right-wing circles. The construction
   of the corpus was carried out using web scraping techniques with the R
   programming language, which has allowed for an exploration of the
   general corpus and the completion of specific analyses as well. The
   study of the political section reveals a Peronism/anti-Peronism
   dichotomy. In addition, new categories, like ``troll,{''} associated
   with local culture, emerge in the discussion among users. This fact
   reveals a certain degree of social polarization. Furthermore, it also
   shows the relevance of the website as a meeting place for diverse and
   even opposing political ideas.},

   This article analyzes, through a combination of qualitative and
   quantitative techniques, the territorial and social factors that
   conditioned the response to the crisis by neighborhood associations in
   seven neighborhoods of the city of Valencia. The results show the
   importance of the relational capital generated in previous stages, as
   well as the characteristics of the network (diversity and functions of
   the nodes) that acted as a necessary support infrastructure for the
   articulation of collective initiatives in neighborhoods with older
   people. socioeconomic needs. Likewise, the impact that the
   transformation of the social fabric that occurs in neighborhoods
   affected by processes of gentrification and population substitution can
   have on these networks is verified through the case study.},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {After the collapse of communism in 1989, several new phenomena emerged
   in the Czech Republic, including the far right, which built on
   aggressive anti -communism, nationalism, and support for right-wing
   currents. At the same time, there was a significant discrediting of
   general leftwing attitudes because of their identification with
   communism. The article focuses on how the Czech Antifascist Action (AFA)
   worked with anti -communism. The article first shows the basic
   principles on which anti -communism is based. It then focuses on post
   -communist anti -communism, specifically in the Czech Republic. At the
   same time, the article presents the history of anarchist anti
   -communism. The article then summarizes AFA's history, specifically its
   Czech version until the COVID-19 period. Methodologically, the article
   uses content analysis. The crucial data source is the texts published by
   AFA in their magazine Antifa News or Akce! and on their website
   Antifa.cz. In principle, it can be assumed that anti -communism played
   several distinct roles but were intertwined and mutually reinforcing. It
   enabled AFA to distinguish itself from the Communist Party and communism
   generally. The specificity of the Czech AFA's anti -communism lies in
   combining both approaches typical of anarchist anti -communism and
   approaches characteristic of the Czech variant of post -communist
   anticommunism.},

Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {53},
Abstract = {During the last ten years, the activity of the Constitutional Court in
   the field of parliamentary amparos has grown exceptionally. New and
   highly relevant cases have been addressed, with characteristics that
   differ from the previous stage. The Constitutional Court has produced a
   wealth of very interesting jurisprudence in several areas and has
   adopted highly controversial rulings. This paper aims to offer a hurried
   chronicle of what this decade of parliamentary jurisprudence has meant,
   from 2014 to 2023, by reviewing all the judgments that have been handed
   down in parliamentary amparos. The overview is followed by some
   reflections on the most relevant aspects. All of this with the
   conviction that this prodigious decade has meant the passage to maturity
   of this typically Spanish mechanism of constitutional justice.},

Title = {The Contributions of Political Science to Processes of Institutional
   Political Change: The Case of Chile},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {This article examines the role of political scientists in the process of
   political change in Chile, considering the political reforms implemented
   between 2006 and 2020. Chile has stood out in comparative studies as a
   stable democracy, but since the 2010s the political system has been
   affected by a crisis of legitimacy and trust. The response to this
   crisis has been a path of legal reforms, and three attempts at
   constitutional change since 2016 to date. Throughout this process of
   political change, expert knowledge has been highly valued, and political
   scientists have been called upon to contribute their own knowledge and
   vision. This coincides with the consolidation of political science as a
   discipline since the 2000s. Thus, for the study of the contributions of
   political science to society, three indicators are considered:
   positioning, degree of influence and prestige, which will be applied to
   three cases: the design of the reform of the electoral system in 2006,
   the political reforms in 2014, and the constituent process and the
   innovation of the election of a parity constituent body in 2020.},

Abstract = {While the EU sees the countries of Central Asia as potential suppliers
   of ``green{''} energy, they themselves rely on fossil fuels to secure
   their own energy supply. With the exception of Turkmenistan, they are
   seeking to expand coal-fired power generation. And all of them want to
   generate higher revenues from the export of oil, gas, and coal and are
   looking for new markets and transportation routes. Having lost its
   Western European market for pipeline gas, Russia is also looking at
   Central Asia and its neighbours for opportunities to sell its natural
   gas. Moscow could get in Turkmenistan's way, especially with a pipeline
   project through the Caspian Sea.},

Abstract = {It has been evident for some time that democracies face significant
   challenges when addressing the issue of climate change. This has given
   rise to atrend that could be termed << eco-authoritarian >>, based on
   the beliefthat the magnitude of the problem may require, in certain
   cases, the suspension of some democratic rules. Contrary to this
   orientation is the so-called << libertarian paternalism >>, which argues
   that it is possible to structure decision-making in a way that
   encourages individuals to make environmentally-oriented choices without
   impinging on their freedom. The thesis of the article is that a response
   to the challenges posed by both sides can be found in a deliberative
   conception of democracy, which draws from the mutual exchange between
   the institutional formation of will and an informal formation of opinion
   and ideas.},

Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2024},
Number = {33},
Abstract = {This contribution proposes to add a new link to the historical
   reconstruction of ethnologist Ernesto De Martino's (1908-1965)
   involvement with the Socialist Party in Southern Italy, in order to
   highlight the issues at stake in his first reading of Gramsci. The
   reconstruction of the Party's context and cultural policy will focus on
   the critique of The World of Magic put forward by Raniero Panzieri
   (1921-1964), who would later become the theorist of workers' inquiry.
   His critique concerns a specific problem of Marxism, that of the
   articulation of theory and praxis, and points to a certain elitism
   inherent in De Martino's first masterpiece. For religious ethnology, the
   problem becomes that of the meaning of ethnographic practice, i.e., of
   an inquiry thought of as both a scientific and a political practice. In
   a second section, we will assess in greater detail Gramsci's influence
   on De Martino from two angles: the religious question as a blind spot in
   Marxism, and the formation of a reunified culture through ethnographic
   practice. In 1948, thanks to Gramsci, De Martino was finally able to
   complete his own critique of Benedetto Croce and put himself forward as
   the first incarnation of the organic intellectual.},

Title = {Wagner Group Flows: A Two-Fold Challenge to Liberal Intervention and
   Liberal Order},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Focusing on Wagner Group (WG) forces, liberal interveners too readily
   dismiss the scope of WG's Africa engagements, including economic and
   political ``flows{''} that, in combination, challenge liberal
   interveners' taken-for-granted access in several states on the African
   continent. Operationalising the notion of ``flows,{''} we present an
   analysis that foregrounds both the scope of WG's Africa engagements and
   the challenges. We portray WG as a broad enterprise by attending to
   military, economic, and political flows. This broadening is relevant to
   how WG is understood to challenge liberal interveners. Besides
   country-specific challenges to liberal interveners' access (notably in
   states where they have been asked to depart or co-exist with WG), a
   broader reading of WG's Africa presence also foregrounds challenges at a
   different level, namely to liberal interveners' assumptions about the
   inevitable attractiveness of the liberal international order. A liberal
   order that Russia has utilised WG's Africa presence to contest. As such,
   challenges at the level of liberal order go beyond WG's Africa presence
   and must, therefore, be viewed alongside other challenges to liberal
   intervention and order, from the Taliban's takeover of Kabul to Russia's
   invasion of Ukraine. If liberal interveners' missteps and historicity,
   as well as the scope of WG's Africa engagements, remain
   underappreciated, then various challenges specific to the WG, but also
   broader challenges to liberal interveners' assumptions about liberal
   order as self-evidently attractive, are too readily dismissed. Liberal
   actors' dismissiveness may invite misguided responses and
   unintentionally become an enabling factor for WG's influence in Africa.},

Abstract = {Inter-village land disputes confronted by the Ifakara Town Council - a
   local governing authority in Tanzania - arise from socio-economic
   complexities, poor boundary demarcation, and weak institutional
   frameworks, making litigation ineffective. Despite the prevalence of
   these conflicts, there is limited understanding of how Alternative
   Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms, particularly mediation, can address
   such issues in rural Tanzania. This study evaluates the applicability
   and effectiveness of ADR, with a focus on mediation, in resolving these
   disputes. Given the limitations of litigation, culturally appropriate
   ADR methods are essential for achieving sustainable conflict resolution.
   The research used a mixed-methods approach, collecting qualitative and
   quantitative data through interviews, document reviews, and
   questionnaires from stakeholders in four villages. The findings show
   that while ADR, especially mediation, is valued for its flexibility and
   cultural relevance, its effectiveness is limited by challenges such as
   poor boundary demarcation, bureaucratic delays, weak institutional
   capacity, and resistance from disputing parties. The study concludes
   that to enhance ADR effectiveness, structural issues like boundary
   demarcation and institutional weaknesses must be addressed. It
   recommends improving boundary clarity, strengthening institutional
   frameworks, increasing community awareness, and establishing monitoring
   systems to ensure compliance with ADR outcomes. These measures could
   promote sustainable land governance in Ifakara and similar regions
   across SubSaharan Africa.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Pages = {134-148},
Abstract = {A number of political scientists believe that the `deep state'
   originated simultaneously with the state itself. But in fact, the
   authors of the article prove that the first effective `deep state' in
   modern history appeared in England during the time of Henry VIII. Then,
   having nationalized the church, the king added to his powers the right
   to create and interpret norms. In response, reacting to the imbalance of
   the political system created by the king, the English aristocracy set
   out to control the monarch. The newly created network of influence was
   based on corruption: belonging to it guaranteed, to an official in the
   king's service, additional benefits and career perspectives. The mean of
   internal control of the network was `ritual compromising evidence', when
   other members witnessed the violating of generally accepted norms and
   rules. This guaranteed that in case of betrayal the reputation and
   future of any potential renegade would be destroyed. However, this
   triggered the processes of `normalization of violations,' which
   culminated in the Cromwellian revolution and the Westminster Confession,
   which not only nullified out all compromising evidence, but also
   abolished the concept of sin in general. After recovering from the
   upheaval, England managed to summarize and theorize its experience. In
   the following century, it started to extrapolate it to France, which was
   its main geopolitical rival, mastering the techniques of cognitive
   programming. The same processes, that had spontaneously developed in
   England a century earlier, were launched in France, but in a controlled
   and guided form. England managed to create its own `deep state' in
   France, which, in fact, inspired and supported the French Enlightenment
   by introducing into the public discourse concepts, which were in fact,
   cognitive operators: their implementation led to the natural conclusion
   of the backwardness of France compared to England. At the same time, the
   `deep state' became a stable construct: thus, classical institutionalism
   assumes it as an integral part of the secular political system. In
   particular, this was realized, and promoted as a norm, by J.-J.
   Rousseau. The authors draw a number of conclusions on the construction
   of the deep state. It is always a network of influence, an alternative
   to power, which actively uses corruption as an instrument of stimulation
   and employs compromising evidence as an instrument of control.},

Abstract = {Compared to the Cortes Generales, the Parliaments of the Autonomous
   Communities seem to receive less attention in empirical academic
   research. The aim of this paper is to analyse public opinion on the
   Parliaments of the Autonomous Communities based on a survey conducted in
   2021 in four Autonomous Communities. Specifically, three interrelated
   dimensions of public opinion on regional parliaments are analysed:
   knowledge, assessment and expectations. Using logit and ordered logit
   econometric models, these dimensions are analysed considering as
   independent variables, variables associated with socio-demographic
   aspects, identification with the Autonomous Community and ideological
   preferences. In doing so, the text aims to contribute to three lines of
   research: on the one hand, to empirical studies of political
   representation, on the other hand, to improve the understanding of the
   Parliaments of the Autonomous Communities and, finally, to contribute to
   the debate on the quality of democracy in Spain.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the explication of the mythological
   determinants of Plato's political doctrine. The author raises the
   question about those axiomatic propositions that underlie the political
   philosophy of the ancient Greek thinker: what is it, the rudiments of
   mythical conscious-ness or the rationality of the nascent philosophical
   logos? The article shows that there are two opposite answers to this
   question. One is associated with the tradition of conceptualizing myth
   as fiction and fantasy (Georg Hegel, Auguste Comte, Feokhari Kessidy),
   the other with the understanding of myth as a special type of
   rationality underlying a certain ontological reality (Friedrich
   Schelling, Alexey Losev, Kurt Huebner). The author shows that modern
   Platonists are increasingly inclined to the second approach and consider
   myth as an indispensable element of Plato's philosophy as such. The
   central element of his system, the doctrine of ideas, is genetically
   linked to classical mythology. Plato's ideas are rationalized
   super-natural entities, divine substances. This understanding finds
   comprehensive manifestation in Plato's political project. The peace of a
   self-identified being is the ideal of a perfect polis. Justice, on the
   other hand, is conformity to one's nature i.e., ultimately, conformity
   to the divine substance expressed in the idea. Thus, the author
   concludes, justice in Plato's project is primarily not a social or
   political category, but an ontological one, and the axiomatics of his
   political thinking is inspired by myth},

   Contemporary Trends},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {12},
Abstract = {From 2016 to 2021, women attempted to or perpetrated suicide attacks in
   Indonesia. These attacks were committed by them as individuals or in
   family units, who were affiliated to the Islamic State. These incidents
   marked the first occurrence of suicide attacks carried out by women in
   Indonesia. Current scholarship and policy analysis of female terrorism
   attributed to the Islamic State or proxy groups is still catching up
   with the implications of trends emerging from women's actions as suicide
   attackers in Indonesia and worldwide. Primarily, scholarly and policy
   analyses of female terrorism focus on the individual woman engaged in
   violence, whereas women who support terrorist groups-as ideologues,
   wives, and online activists-are given a secondary analytical focus. This
   creates conceptual limitations in understanding women's pathways to
   violence, which can encompass violent and supportive roles within the
   social world in which they operate. Using Indonesia as a case study,
   this article advances a framework to account for the mobilisation of
   different identities to commit violence across personal and political
   linkages. In examining historical and current developments in Indonesia,
   this article illustrates that women as supporters or actors of violence,
   while largely conforming to traditional gender ideology and roles, are
   driven by both personal and political considerations.},

Title = {THE VICISSITUDES OF THE HUMAN RIGHT TO PEACE. REPORT OF AN UNFINISHED
   CODIFICATION PROCESS},
Journal = {REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE PENSAMIENTO POLITICO},
Year = {2024},
Number = {19},
Abstract = {In this article we review the conversion of peace into a human rights
   category over the last decades considering three perspectives: 1) the
   two-track codification process in which the participation of civil
   society organisations and non-state actors' initiatives were prominent,
   2) the status of the right to peace within third-generation human rights
   and in relation to the conception of positive peace, and 3) some
   political implications derived from demanding the accountability of
   states and the promotion of social justice at the global level. we
   conclude that the ultimate outcome of this juridification process to
   date, the Declaration on the Right to Peace, is probably an interim
   achievement in a larger collective learning process.},

Title = {The ``EU-Leash{''}: Growth Model Resilience and Change in the EU's
   Eastern Periphery},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Although the EU's Eastern periphery has been afflicted by a series of
   crises over the past two decades, the region's dependent market
   economies have shown puzzling resilience. Since the global financial
   crisis, the FDI-led, export -oriented growth models of the Visegr \&
   aacute;d countries have been reinforced. Meanwhile, the debt -based,
   consumption -oriented capitalism of the Baltic states has not
   experienced dramatic shifts either, despite a strengthening of its
   export component. Scholarly accounts from a comparative political
   economy perspective explain this resilience as the product of country
   -specific factors and tend to downplay the role of external influence.
   Instead, we aim to bridge these approaches with international political
   economy scholarship by arguing that European integration, in general,
   and the EU's transnational regulatory influence, in particular, serves
   as an external anchoring mechanism for both semi -peripheral growth
   models. In addition to the region's structural characteristics, such as
   deep embeddedness in global value chains, high exposure to trade with
   the EU, and dependence on external sources of finance, which already
   limit domestic agency in changing national growth models, we argue that
   European transnational regulatory integration involves an ``EU-leash{''}
   that sets the boundaries for domestic economic policies, thereby
   influencing growth model trajectories. This ensures institutional
   continuity and prevents sudden and radical changes in semi -peripheral
   growth models. We demonstrate these mechanisms through two country
   studies (Estonia and Hungary).},

Title = {Belarus' Sovereignty in Question: Assessing its de facto
   Sovereign Status in the Shadow of Russia},
Journal = {POLITOLOGIJA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {114},
Number = {2},
Pages = {130-176},
Abstract = {The paper explores state sovereignty by developing a systematic
   framework for categorising states based on their sovereignty status. At
   the heart of our analysis lies the distinction between sovereign states
   and satellite states-a distinction that has significant implications for
   global security, stability, and the balance of power. While sovereign
   states exercise full autonomy and control over their affairs, satellite
   states often find themselves in a subordinate position, heavily
   influenced or even dominated by external powers. Athe-oretical framework
   deconstructs the concept of sovereignty into four crucial elements:
   authority, legitimacy, independence, and territoriality, which provide a
   structured assessment of the level of sovereignty in a state and serve
   as the basis for our analysis. To illustrate the application of our
   framework, we adopt a case study approach focused on Belarus. As a
   nation situated at the crossroads of Eastern Europe with a history
   marked by geopolitical contestation and strategic manoeuvring, Belarus
   provides a compelling context for examining sovereignty dynamics.
   Through a systematic analysis of Belarus' political, economic, and
   military landscape, we seek to assess its sovereignty status within the
   framework of our analysis. While the topic of Belarus' sovereignty and
   integration within Russia has been extensively explored over the years,
   the innovative contribution of this paper lies in purposefully designed
   methodology for sovereignty assessment and the use of the latest
   empirical data while practically applying the model for the case of
   Belarus.},

Abstract = {This article investigates Machiavelli's relationship with the treatment
   of tyranny in scholastic Aristotelianism. More specifically, it analyzes
   Machiavelli's omissive analysis of tyranny against the backdrop of the
   Vernacular translated texts of two Aristotelian thinkers who were
   present in Machiavelli's context: Giles of Rome and Marsilius of Padua.
   It is argued that some pragmatic political themes of Machiavelli's
   political thought have interesting antecedents already in previous
   Medieval Aristotelian thinkers.},

Abstract = {How do foreign rivals perceive and respond to heightened domestic
   polarization in the United States? The conventional thinking is that
   polarization weakens and distracts the United States, emboldening its
   adversaries. However, untested assumptions underlie this claim. We use
   two strategies to explore mechanisms linking domestic polarization and
   international rivalry. First, we field a survey experiment in China to
   examine how heightening perceptions of US polarization affects public
   attitudes toward Chinese foreign policy. Second, we investigate how US
   rival governments responded to an episode of extreme partisanship: the
   US Capitol attacks on January 6, 2021. Drawing on Integrated Crisis
   Early Warning System event data, we explore whether foreign rivals
   increased hostility toward the United States following the Capitol
   riots. Both studies fail to show robust evidence for the Emboldening
   Hypothesis. Extreme polarization has other negative consequences for
   American foreign policy, but we find no evidence that it makes
   adversaries materially more assertive toward the United States.},

Abstract = {The practices of antifascists in Lesbos, Greece have highlighted, on the
   one hand, the biopolitical practices of the humanitarian sector and
   authorities and, on the other hand, they have shown the potentiality for
   an ``affirmative{''} biopolitics. The different biopolitical
   orientations operational in Lesbos came clearly to the fore in the two
   cases of the Occupation of Sapphous Square and the Occupation of SYRIZA
   offices in Mytilene, Lesbos in autumn of 2017. The two cases
   additionally showed that mediation, too, is biopolitical, and therefore
   subject to the same bi-directionality insofar that both the humanitarian
   sector and the antifascists acted as mediators, albeit serving different
   political objectives. Furthermore, these practices in Lesbos allow us to
   understand biopolitics as bi-directional insofar that on the ground in
   Lesbos, which we also find in theoretical reflections, attempts have
   been made to disentangle life from the apparatuses that control, manage,
   and even exterminate life.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRANSFORMATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The article studies mechanical effects of the mixed-member electoral
   system on disproportionality - the difference between votes gained by
   parties and their shares of seats - in four post-communist countries in
   Europe: Georgia, Hungary, Lithuania, and Ukraine. The article relies on
   the quantitative analysis of 32 elections, including those held in 2024.
   The study indicates that the role of the majoritarian component is more
   significant in increasing the overall level of disproportionality. This
   in turn, is mostly due to overrepresented seats gained by the winning
   parties. On the other hand, high level of legal threshold in the PR
   component raises the level of disproportionality, which is also
   reflected in a total indicator. In this regard, votes gained by parties
   that fail to meet the threshold also influence the level of
   disproportionality. Moreover, the study reveals that the elections held
   under the linked (compensatory) mixed-member system exhibited lower
   level of disproportionality than the ones held under the unlinked
   (parallel) system.},

Journal = {STATE CRIME},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {The United States (US) involvement in covert action abroad has received
   significant scholarly attention, including the outsourcing of force to
   third parties, such as foreign death squads, private paramilitaries, and
   more recently private military and security companies. However, less
   attention has been paid to the routine and everyday mechanisms the US
   state uses to administer outsourced force, and the impacts this has both
   on the combatants and civilians. Through a historical examination of the
   covert conflict in Laos from 1962-1975, this article documents the
   routine administrative mechanisms the US state employed to prosecute an
   illegal war. This article's principal contribution to the state crime
   literature is the documentation of the hidden harms this generated both
   for the combatants used and the civilians affected by the violence. This
   contribution is grounded in interviews conducted with ex-service people
   from the conflict period and archival research, including recently
   declassified materials.},

   Political Parties Have to Offer?},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Since 2018, Poland has been a net migration country, yet public debates
   on migrants and migration remain scarce and have been defined by a
   reactionary nature. This article, adopting a political opportunity
   structure perspective, focuses on political parties as the main actors
   shaping opportunities and constraints for migrant political
   participation and representation in Polish society. Based on a
   qualitative content analysis of party manifestos and parliamentary
   debates, and using the deductive thematic analysis framework, this study
   analysed three types of arguments parties have adopted regarding the
   admission of migrants. The findings revealed that Polish political
   parties, failing to see non-voting migrants as promising electoral
   targets, have weaponised the migrant issue and used it as an element of
   the partisan battle to attack opponents, especially during the election
   campaign period, instead of stimulating migrants' political
   participation and offering them channels for representation.},

Title = {FARC-EP dissidents groups: continuation or new criminal groups?},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {After the signing of the Peace Agreements in 2016, between the Colombian
   State and the FARC-EP guerrilla, illegal armed dissident groups have
   emerged in various regions of Colombia, especially areas with a
   historical presence of conflict and illicit crops. Given the contextual
   differences between both organizations, the objective of this article is
   to explore and describe whether the dissidences are a continuity in
   ideological, structural, political and economic terms of the old
   guerrilla movement, or if, on the contrary, they are a new type of
   organization. For this, political-ideological, social control and
   financing factors are analyzed from a historical approach with a
   qualitative, descriptive, and correlational analysis. The results allow
   us to identify that there are some continuities, but several ruptures
   with the old FARC-EP. The dissidences do not have a structure of the
   size of the guerrilla group, but it is not a diminished group either,
   since they have more strength and control than other types of
   organizations, which allows them to be characterized more as criminal
   organizations and raises the idea of a new cycle of violence in the
   country.},

   the problem of a constrained agency, in which the rejected sexuality
   founds the melancholic discourse {[}2]; it proposes furthermore queer
   rage as political stylization of melancholic loss in terms of an
   accusation against oppression {[}3]; it presents an alternative approach
   in terms of a radical queer and masochistic passivity as possible
   gesture within power and discourse {[}4]; and concludes, provisionally,
   with the formulation of shamelessness as a political disposition through
   which the discussed problems might be organized as thought figures},

Abstract = {This article presents ``pazes{''}, not only as a grammatical
   insubordination, but also as an important concept within the critical
   and pazological approaches of Latin America. ``Pazes{''} is a verb that
   translates into action and becomes more than just an idea. It gains its
   meaning from community decolonial feminisms and the economic practice of
   peasant women in the P \& aacute;ramo area of Colombia's Eastern
   Antioquia. This practice, from cosmogonic suspicion, care and good
   living, raises questions which subvert the hegemony established by
   multiple violence in the body-territory of peasant women. At the same
   time, it highlights their resistance, their plural knowledge that is
   woven into everyday life, and their contribution to sustaining the
   Network of Life.},

Abstract = {Political scientists have undergone major transformations in recent
   decades. In addition to gaining greater visibility in the public sphere,
   which allows them for social recognition, these professionals have
   expanded their field of action, from academia and public administration
   to NGOs, think tanks, and consultancy firms, among many others. These
   transformations are the result of processes of institutionalization and
   professionalization of the discipline, as well as several structural
   changes (technological transformation, diversification of the labor
   market, new complexity of politics, etc.).},

Abstract = {Aleksei Naval'nyi stood like no other for Russian society's resistance
   to Putin's authoritarianism. With his heroic fearlessness, he won tens
   of thousands of followers and created the ethics of a new resistance.
   For more than ten years, he formulated and coordinated the politics of
   protest. His popularity over the past 15 years can be explained
   primarily by the hopes and expectations that he bundled and embodied.
   These hopes and expectations are an expression of a social capital that
   parts of the post-Soviet generations in Russia had at their disposal.
   The war against Ukraine launched by Putin is intended to destroy this
   social capital. Russia is to be transformed into a haven of conservatism
   and militaristic obscurantism.},

Title = {Back to the future. Socialism and nationalism as tools for political
   legitimization},
Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {601-628},
Abstract = {This article analyzes how, in the past years, Russia's political
   discourse has concentrated on the Country's place and role in the modern
   world and how top-down political communication seems to have somewhat
   succeeded in affecting the population's political culture and reviving
   old ideologies. The armed conflict declared by Russia against Ukraine
   seems to have had the effect of strengthening - once again- the
   polarization between the West and the East. New geopolitical
   arrangements and new power relations are being reorganized, and, in this
   process, political cultures and ideologies seem to be reshaped. In
   particular, the data from Russian national surveys on the population's
   political values and the analysis of political discourses show that
   Russia seems to have dusted off its old socialist ideology, emphasizing
   its nationalistic and neo-imperial traits while deepening its
   neo-authoritarian turn. After the collapse of the Soviet Union and a
   short period of de-ideologization, the Russian government has repeatedly
   attempted to develop a nationwide general civil ideology, mainly using
   the concepts of the ``Russian world{''} and of ``neo-Eurasianism{''},
   considered as neo-imperial ideologies, that determined the content of
   public discourse in Russia. Nationalism is both an ideology and a
   political practice based on the value of the nation as the highest form
   of social unity. This kind of nationalism is widely used by states
   through official rhetoric, symbols and ideological institutions
   (education, social sciences, mass media) to assert civil loyalty and
   disseminate national legal norms and cultural values. (Tishkov, 2021).
   Nationalism and Neo-conservatism have become of particular importance to
   Russian society, and during the last decade, they have become the core
   of the Country's political actions and rhetoric. Neoconservatism
   includes a set of different ideological patterns such as nationalism,
   imperial claims, orientations on special ways of Russia, the priority of
   traditional values, etc., which are accompanied by authoritarian
   tendencies in the political process (A. Panarin, 1994, Dugin 2000). In
   this way, it seems correct to affirm that the neo-conservative ideology
   becomes the sociocultural base of the whole process of power
   legitimization. In this context and in the frames of the actual
   political system, no political movement, party, or group of interests
   can act as a real competitor of the federal government, which has built
   its ethnopolitics not only on the idea of uniting different nations of
   the Russian Federation but also on ideas of irredentism. This is not
   totally new. If in the 90s, political discourse and public dialogue were
   dominated by the idea of democratization and of transition from an
   authoritarian to an open society, only a decade later, as early as
   Putin's first mandate, political discourse started to turn to the idea
   of ``stability{''} and of ``sustainability of the system and of the
   welfare state{''}, coupled with the idea of a so-called ``conservative
   modernization{''} that essentially implied the beginning of a new era of
   anti-reformism and a nostalgic call for the Socialist past. In this
   article, moving from a neo-Marxist perspective on the concept of
   Political Culture (Burlackij, 1970; Markiewicz, 1971; Wiatr, 1980), we
   will analyze how these political ideas and values have turned into a
   political culture that seems coherent with the above mentioned
   neo-imperial nationalist ideology, and, most importantly, that is
   inclined to support it.
   Whereas the Russians who do not support the regime, seem far from being
   capable of displaying a coherent and alternative political culture, let
   alone organizing a different political programme that could activate a
   counteroffensive. While taking into account public speeches from
   prominent political leaders, the empirical basis of the article derives
   from the data of the all-Russia annual sociological monitoring ``How do
   you live, Russia{''} (1992-2023) carried out by the Institute of
   Socio-Political Research- Branch of the Federal Centre of Theoretical
   and Applied Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, through a
   survey on a sample of 14001800 respondents, representative of all the
   Russian population. As we will see, the data shows that new forms of
   civic nationalism are largely based on nostalgic sympathies for the
   Soviet past and a new civil identity, formed successfully during the
   post-soviet period, is increasingly affirming itself.},

   Rural NEETs},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic created unprecedented pressure to accelerate
   public employment services (PES) digitalisation across Europe. In fact,
   there is now a considerable amount of funding dedicated to that goal in
   broadband policy packages, such as the Recovery and Resilience
   Mechanism. This pressure for digitalizing PES presumes that its benefits
   outweigh the existing risks, regardless of citizens' singularities, such
   as vulnerable young people going through the school -to -work
   transition. Bearing that in mind, and following a bioecological model
   framework, our article addresses two main goals. Firstly, based on a
   targeted literature review, we detail the challenges and possibilities
   posed by PES digitalisation for vulnerable young people in EU countries,
   which have been widely overlooked in the literature. We specifically
   argue that despite several practical advantages (e.g., releasing staff
   from time-consuming administrative tasks), PES digitalisation will only
   be beneficial for vulnerable young people if three interrelated
   challenges are taken into account: nurturing trust in institutions and
   digital tools, supporting digital transformation of PES institutional
   organization, and adopting a co -design lens for PES digitalisation.
   Secondly, using a knowledge integration approach, we describe a model
   for assessing PES capacity to digitally support rural young people not
   in employment, education, or training to enter the labour market. We
   conclude that the overemphasis on the expected advances of overall PES
   digitalisation must be followed by thoughtful consideration of PES
   digitalisation processes to ensure EU social inclusion targets for the
   younger generations.},

Title = {GR-MANAGEMENT AND PUBLIC POLICY},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {6},
Pages = {170-178},
Abstract = {The basis for thinking about the current state of interaction between
   business and public authorities is the monograph ``GR-management of
   business organizations in modern Russia. Complex analysis and applied
   technologies{''} (Degtyarev, A.A., \& Teteryuk, A.S. (Ed.). Moscow:
   Prometej, 2024). The paper notes the consonance of the contents of the
   book with the trends in the development of the professional sphere of GR
   (Government Relations) in a modern society with a market economy.
   Methodologically, the book deals with the concept of interest groups in
   politics, when the interaction of business with public authorities is
   described in the system of political governance
   functionally-strategically (lobbyism), micro- tactically (lobbying) and
   technologically-procedurally (GR-management). The monograph includes
   ideas about conflictual interaction between business and the state and
   the orientation of GR management towards achieving company profitability
   and obtaining political rent. However, this interpretation of the
   axiology of business, as shown in the paper, is insufficient and
   contradicts the modern understanding of capitalism as ``stakeholder{''}
   oriented and ``inclusive{''}, in which profit, although the goal of
   business, is subject to public values. Hence, it is not lobbying
   (unilateral influence on the public decision-making process), but
   corporate public policy (socially responsible and partner behavior of
   business) that constitutes the strategic orientation of GR-management.
   With such interaction between business and authorities, communication
   comes to the fore as a search for mutually agreed positions in public
   policy.},

Title = {GREEN STICK? COERCIVE CAPACITY AND NON-POLITICAL PROTESTS IN RUSSIA:
   CASE OF ENVIRONMENTAL MOBILIZATION},
Journal = {POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {115},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Environmental activism is one of the important forms of civic activity
   in all types of political regimes. But under the conditions of
   autocracies it has a distinct specificity, which involves a conscious
   distancing from politics. The tendency to avoid ``politicization{''} is
   an integral component of the strategy of eco-activists, who are well
   aware of the risks of protest actions in an authoritarian context.
   Environmental protest activity is often perceived as non-political by
   the ruling elites, but their reaction to it varies. In search of an
   answer to the question about the causes of such variations the authors
   elaborate a theoretical model, according to which the reaction of elites
   to environmental activism is determined by the power potential of the
   heads of executive government in combination with a high level of
   inequality, which signals the possible risks of eco-protests turning
   into broad political mobilization. The model is tested on data
   concerning environmental protests in Russian regions. By using the
   method of statistical modelling, the authors come to the conclusion,
   that the factor of socio-economic inequality does not affect the
   intensity of environmental mobilization, but has a key significance as a
   catalyst for the coercive reaction of the authorities. In the regions
   with high levels of inequality, the ``stick{''} is systematically
   applied to environmentalists, while in regions with relatively moderate
   economic stratification environmental protests remain an acceptable form
   of expressing discontent. At the same time, the presence of a coercive
   component in the political capital of regional elites plays a crucial
   role in reducing the eco-protest potential. In addition to that, the
   research indicates that regional protest activity on environmental
   issues in Russia is leaving the format of non-political mobilization. As
   a result, the authorities' response is increasingly based on
   suppression, similar to other types of protests, which potentially
   limits the opportunities for conveying an environmental agenda.},

Journal = {POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {112},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The article analyzes the factors of generalized social trust in the
   modern states. The authors rely on the ``up bottom{''} approach, which
   as- sumes that trust in political institutions has a significant impact
   on social trust, while also accounting for socio-economic factors. The
   research study of the modern European states that employed regression
   analysis of the sociological data from the World Values Survey and
   Eurobarometer shows that political trust continues to have a positive
   effect on the level of social trust. However, economic development and
   low levels of social stratification are equally important. A potentially
   important new factor is the increase in trust in urban communities,
   while the presence or absence of the communist past has lost its
   influence on social trust. The authors examine the case of Russia
   separately due to the specifics of political trust in personalist
   presidential regimes, Russia's longer exposure to communism, as well as
   the modern increase in the level of political trust, which radically
   exceeds the level of social trust. Based on the comparative study of
   sociological trends and factors of social trust in the country, they
   document the gradual development of a situation where social trust is
   inversely correlated with political trust. They tend to explain this
   phenomenon by the exaggerated importance of the personal and public
   security agenda, which negatively affects social trust, while
   simultaneously increases the demand for political trust. Socio-economic
   factors in Russia play a limited role, but can resume their influence
   during periods of reduced social tensions. According to the authors'
   conclusion, given the current political system, the potential for
   increase in social trust in the Russian Federation is limited.},

Abstract = {Over the past 30 years, the mixed parallel electoral system has become
   one of the popular types of electoral systems used in elections to
   national legislatures. Curiously, it received the highest popularity in
   authoritarian regimes. The article attempts to identify internal
   political factors that contribute to the introduction of mixed parallel
   electoral systems under the conditions of electoral authoritarianism. To
   perform this task, the author uses the binary logistic regression
   method. In this study, the author makes an assumption that when
   implementing electoral reform under authoritarianism, the ruling elite
   is largely guided by the desire to maintain and strengthen its power.
   The study shows that the mixed parallel electoral system is most likely
   to be introduced during the period of regime transformation. At the
   initial stage of the consolidation of an authoritarian regime that
   allows multi-party competition, the ruling elite faces the challenge of
   institutionalizing electoral uncertainty. The effectiveness and
   durability of the political regime depends on how the risks associated
   with elections are neutralized. The mechanical combination of
   majoritarian and proportional representation principles opens up an
   opportunity to utilize the advantages of each of the electoral formulas
   conditional on the political situation, allowing the existing
   authorities to gain control over the sweeping majority of seats in
   parliament even when electoral competition is increasing and the support
   for the dominant party is falling. According to the author's conclusion,
   the use of the mixed parallel system plays an important role in the
   consolidation of an authoritarian regime. Due to the mechanisms inherent
   in this system, the ruling elite can efficiently manipulate elections,
   ensuring the survival and stability of the authoritarian order.},

Abstract = {In the last two decades, Latin American high courts engaged in
   institutional innovations promoting social participation in their
   judicial decision-making through mechanisms as public hearings, amicus
   curiae, or the use of social media. This article first theorizes this
   engagement with the public. Building on insights about judicial
   legitimacy as well as stra-tegic and ideational accounts it discusses
   possible motivations of courts to open to the public and the effects of
   this behavior. Second, it provides a conceptualization of such court
   engagement and a typology of this engagement according to different
   levels of intensity. Third, with a comparative assessment of sixteen
   high courts from all democratic Latin American countries, it shows that
   this court behavior is observable for all countries, except-ing Uruguay,
   but differs regarding the intensity of opening},

   Affectedness Influences Support for Anti-Liberal Policies},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Do people support ostensibly effective policy measures that curtail
   liberal rights and civil liberties or instead stick to liberal
   principles when confronted with an unprecedented crisis? This article
   examines the relationship between individuals' perceptions of the
   Covid-19 pandemic and their attitudes toward democracy as they consider
   effective countermeasures. It asks (a) whether individuals' sense of
   being affected by the pandemic shapes their attitudes toward democratic
   policymaking and (b) whether this relationship is moderated by trust and
   authoritarianism. The analysis builds on a customized survey in Austria
   that includes a conjoint experiment to test the acceptability of various
   illiberal policies. It shows that while feeling affected by Covid-19
   does not have the hypothesized effect, there are strong interactions
   with respondents' political attitudes. Citizens' willingness to
   sacrifice democracy for more effective policies depends both on whether
   they perceive the pandemic as a personal problem and on their attitudes
   toward government and democracy.},

Title = {Towards a political concept of dignity},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a new way of thinking about the concept of dignity.
   It argues that existing conceptions of dignity in moral and legal
   philosophy fail to meet three key tests: conceptual soundness,
   analytical usefulness, and a capacity to vindicate the principle of
   moral egalitarianism. It suggests that we can better satisfy all three
   of these conditions if we treat dignity as a relational and political
   concept that is defined by a sense of what we are due. This means its
   content derives not from any transcendental truth or legal authority but
   has to be negotiated between different actors. It can then be asserted
   as part of an egalitarian project without needing to make reference to
   an external authority or a confused conceptual base. It seeks to show
   that this understanding of dignity is free of the conceptual confusion
   that plagues the existing conceptions; is closer to the `common'
   understanding of dignity in ordinary language and thus more analytically
   useful; finally can be deployed more successfully in defence of the
   principle of moral equality.},

   shifts in assertiveness towards Russia},

Abstract = {The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has prompted a closer examination
   of parties' attitudes towards the Putin regime. While research has
   examined the connections of the EU's far-right with Russia, less
   attention has been given to the stances of Radical Left Parties (RLPs).
   We close this gap by analysing Roll Call Votes (RCVs) in the European
   Parliament. Our findings indicate that RLPs displayed the lowest levels
   of assertiveness towards Russia before 2022, being even less assertive
   than other Eurosceptic groups. RLPs significantly increased their
   assertiveness after the invasion, bringing them closer to the EP
   mainstream. However, some divergence in assertiveness towards Russia
   existed within the RLPs before 2022 and remains relevant after the
   invasion, with the Traditional/Communist parties standing closer to
   Russia than radical New Left/Democratic Socialist parties.},

Abstract = {The demarcation between leisure activities and volunteering is not
   clearly visible and the divide between them is vague. We hypothesize
   that these fields are interrelated and are not mutually exclusive in
   peoples' way of life. In the empirical analysis, we use a survey with a
   nationwide and representative probability sample of young people in
   Hungary (Hungarian Youth 2020 Survey). In the first step, we carried out
   exploratory factor analysis based on the location of leisure activities.
   In accordance with the theory of cultural omnivores, we identified two
   factors of leisure time use: high-culture omnivore and recreational
   omnivore. In the second step, we applied a logistic regression model
   with young people's odds of volunteering as the dependent variable, and
   socio-demographic variables and the resulting factors as independent
   variables. The results are in accordance with our hypothesis about the
   compatibility of volunteering and leisure time use, as both resulting
   factors positively correlated with volunteering in the sample of young
   people we analysed. A further result is that the effect of the
   recreational factor was slightly more pronounced than the high-culture
   factor, which suggests the possibility of promoting young people's
   volunteering by emphasizing the social and recreational elements of
   volunteering activities.},

Abstract = {This article analyses modes of policymaking related to asylum-seekers'
   reception in Italy and other European Union (EU) countries during the
   decade of the so-called 2015 asylum crisis. It shows that, while most EU
   countries experienced shifts towards more hierarchical modes of
   policymaking on asylum, Italy pursued a unique experience of multilevel
   governance (MLG) between 2014 and 2016, which was then dismantled in
   2017. By looking at this MLG experience as a `heuristic case', the
   article contributes to an ongoing debate about the drivers of MLG as a
   mode of policymaking. The existing literature suggests that MLG modes of
   policymaking are driven by institutional and structural factors or
   pressure by subnational and supranational actors for more participatory
   policymaking processes. Complementing and challenging these theoretical
   explanations we generate some hypotheses about additional factors that
   drive the emergence and dismantling of MLG. First, we argue that both
   supranational actors and subnational authorities, typically considered
   to be agents promoting MLG, can also advocate for more hierarchical
   modes of policymaking. Second, we argue that a fundamental prerequisite
   for MLG to emerge or persist is an overall convergence of political
   priorities and goals among the actors involved in multilevel
   policymaking. Both the kind of pressures made by supranational and
   subnational actors and actors' political priorities can be decisively
   shaped by dynamics of multilevel party politics. These findings are
   derived from analyses of 147 interviews with key actors involved in
   Italian asylum policymaking in the 2010s.},

Abstract = {In her time as Prime Minister of the sixth Labour government, Jacinda
   Ardern made inequality and poverty central issues in her political
   agenda, and committed the government she led to making a lasting impact
   on these issues. In this article, I evaluate their approach to
   inequality and poverty in two distinct ways. I first provide an account
   of the policy initiatives of the sixth Labour government (2017-2023) and
   summarise the effects of these initiatives. This analysis shows that the
   government relied primarily on politically straightforward and
   uncontroversial policy actions that did not challenge important aspects
   of the status quo. Second, I present a critical evaluation of the policy
   narratives of inequality and poverty constructed by Ardern and her
   government. This analysis of key texts finds that inequality was
   constructed overwhelmingly in terms of the problem of poverty (eliding
   the issue of wealth concentration) and that the Government's policy
   narratives were consistently inclusive and politically non-threatening,
   refusing to acknowledge or address the social cleavages that contribute
   to and that are exacerbated by poverty and inequality.},

Abstract = {In a between-subjects experiment (n = 3270) conducted in Flanders (the
   Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), we examine the electoral ramifications
   of claims by a right-wing mainstream party on their willingness to rule
   or not with RWPPs (radical right populist parties). Participants were
   exposed to a social media post by the largest right-wing party (New
   Flemish Alliance, N-VA) in which it either accepts or rejects ruling
   with the main RWPP in Flanders (Vlaams Belang, VB). Findings reveal a
   main effect on propensity to vote (PTV) for the RWPP: in the inclusion
   condition the propensity to vote for the RWPP is significantly higher
   than in the exclusion condition; this holds particularly for
   policy-driven voters. The mainstream party, however, nor gains or loses
   electoral support. This suggests a legitimization effect: claims by
   mainstream parties on willingness to rule with RWPPs serves the former,
   while mainstream parties do not gain electorally.},

Title = {Messaging both sides: Party leadership support for conflicting positions
   in the US House},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 24},
Abstract = {Parties in the House expend substantial resources on messaging to
   achieve party goals. Part of that effort involves materials intended to
   shape individual member communications, including where members'
   messages matter a great deal-in ex-plaining floor votes. In the 1990s
   and 2000s, Republican leaders issued regular vote justifications for
   members, simultaneously advancing party messages and serving individual
   members. But in some cases, the leaders justified both positions on a
   vote. How did the leadership weigh the benefit of framing a party
   division against the cost of providing rhetorical support for anti-party
   votes? I find that the conservative GOP leadership was more likely to
   support defectors when they represented a more conservative group of
   members; they were also more likely to provide two messages as party
   cohesion on a vote declined. The case illustrates strategic decisions
   the leadership makes about messaging via individual member
   communications.},

Title = {The Generalizability of IR Experiments beyond the United States},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 23},
Abstract = {Theories of international relations (IR) typically make predictions
   intended to hold across many countries, yet existing experimental
   evidence testing their micro-foundations relies overwhelmingly on
   studies fielded in the United States. We argue that the broad nature of
   many IR theories makes it especially important to evaluate the extent to
   which their predictions hold across countries. To examine the
   generalizability of IR experimental findings beyond the US, we
   implemented a preregistered and harmonized multisite replication study,
   fielding four prominent IR experiments across a diverse set of seven
   democracies: Brazil, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Nigeria, and the US.
   We find high levels of generalizability across all four experiments, a
   pattern further analysis suggests is due to limited treatment effect
   heterogeneity. Our findings and approach offer important empirical and
   methodological insights for the design and interpretation of future
   experimental research in IR.},

Abstract = {Can qualifications help candidates from historically marginalized groups
   win over out-group voters? We help answer this question with an original
   conjoint experiment fielded on a face-to-face survey conducted in three
   Afghan provinces between 2016 and 2017. The conjoint asked over 2,400
   Afghan respondents to rank and choose between profiles of hypothetical
   candidates with varying gender, ethnic and educational attributes. We
   explore whether candidate qualifications - as measured by educational
   attainment - can amplify respondents' support for hypothetical
   candidates from two social groups traditionally underrepresented in
   Afghan politics: women and Hazaras, a predominately Shi'a ethnic
   minority group. We find that higher qualifications consistently increase
   male (non-Hazara) respondents' ranking and likelihood of choosing
   profiles with female (Hazara) candidates. These gains, however, do not
   completely offset male (non-Hazara) respondents' in-group biases.
   Qualifications help but are not enough to dismantle voter preferences
   for in-group candidates.},

Abstract = {On the campaign trail, candidates often promote their business
   credentials and claim that success in business leads to success in
   politics. These claims appeal to a subset of the American electorate
   that distrusts ``career politicians{''} and views business expertise as
   a solution to a host of problems with U.S. democracy. Yet the
   scholarship is mixed on whether business politicians are better
   legislators. We investigate the legislative records of U.S. senators
   (1983-2021) and find no evidence that senators with business careers are
   more effective legislators than their peers. This casts doubt on the
   claims that ``probusiness{''} skills, talents, or personality traits
   give legislators an edge. However, we are unable to reject the
   hypothesis that business people who pursue cooperation and
   consensus-building-values often promoted by business Democrats-are more
   inclined to succeed in office. We find that Democrats with business
   experience are more effective than their peers and tend to be more
   bipartisan and less extreme in their floor voting.},

Pages = {26-36},

Abstract = {The 2024 general election delivered a verdict on an unpopular
   Conservative government, a valence election where the key motivation was
   to remove a government seen as failing. But this is not a full account
   of the voting choices of the British public. The rise of `second
   dimension' politics and the associated value positions within the public
   have driven a fragmentation of the electorate. This, combined with
   multiparty competition, leads to complex patterns of party support
   across the electorate. This fragmentation explains the volatility in
   recent elections and the relative success of `third' parties and
   independent candidates. It explains why, in a valence election, there
   was not a simple transfer of votes between alternative governing
   parties. This fragmentation poses electoral and policy challenges for
   all political parties and will have important implications for British
   politics over the next parliamentary cycle and beyond.},

   self-transformation},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 13},
Abstract = {This paper explores the self-transformation of a former terrorist in
   Indonesia who is building a role as an activist against violent
   extremism. This case study focuses on the former extremist's process of
   self-change. The participant is a 42-year-old male who was a member of
   Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), and who was captured in 2014 and imprisoned. The
   paper draws on in-depth interviews conducted with this individual and
   his wife. The findings explore how he became involved in JI, arising
   from a sense of solidarity with the global jihadist movement and the
   need for self-significance. The process of self-change is explored,
   relating to the impact of encounters in prison and an increasing
   awareness of the burden his actions had on his family and the way
   terrorism framed Islam and Muslims in a negative light. This transition
   led this former extremist to become a member of an NGO campaigning
   against violent extremism. This study provides insight into the role of
   self-transformation in the disengagement and reintegration process.},

Abstract = {This study aims to illustrate that multi -vectorial approaches in
   foreign policy could not only be practical but also productive for
   middle powers. With this aim, the study conceptualizes Turkish foreign
   policy in Asia with multi-vectorism, a foreign policy behavioral pattern
   that has been mainly utilized for post -Soviet countries' concurrent
   interactions with the West (the EU, the U.S.) and the non -West
   (Russia). The study, firstly, argues that Asian international relations
   require a more composite re -definition of multi-vectorism, since in
   Asia, due to the intra-regional fragmentations and diversions, there are
   more than the conventional two vectors, the West and the non -West. By
   considering this argument the study applies multi-vectorism to T \&
   uuml;rkiye's foreign policy in Asia by comparing the practicability of
   different interaction patterns, e.g., multilateralism, minilateralism,
   and bilateralism. The study, secondly, argues that T \& uuml;rkiye's
   multi -vectorial foreign policy in Asia is particularly successful in
   its bilateral relations and less so in its multilateral and minilateral
   interactions.},

Abstract = {The lack of political education for the people of Ciamis Regency in
   local head elections has an impact on the lack of voter information on
   local head candidates, so that political behavior is based on
   assumptions and non-rational factors. Voters are vulnerable to negative
   influences in the local head election process and are rooted in
   political fraud at the grassroots. This study aims to determine Voters
   response to public information disclosure policies in the local head
   election of Ciamis Regency 2024. The research method uses qualitative
   research with an explanatory approach. The results showed that the level
   of community response in Ciamis Regency in the pre-election process of
   local head elections was quite high, as evidenced by the many positive
   comments and the enthusiasm of the community to express their opinions
   on social media platforms regarding candidates for Regent and Deputy
   Regent in the 2024 local head elections. Furthermore, to increase voter
   participation in future local head elections, the General Election
   Commission of Ciamis Regency must increase the intensity of
   socialization, political education, and conduct extensive social media
   monitoring.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a definition of the concept of postcolonial
   justice in view of elaborating a fruitful theoretical framework for
   connecting distinct demands for racial, cultural, epistemic, memorial,
   and spatial justice that have been emerging on a global scale in the
   last two decades. The article conceives postcolonial justice as both
   critical and reparative, maintaining that reparation claims must be
   considered a crucial pillar in a theory of postcolonial justice. It also
   argues that postcolonial justice is better understood as a complement to
   a radically egalitarian conception of global social justice, which is
   anti-capitalist and anti-colonial. Finally, it concludes that while
   reparations are relevant for an anti-capitalist and anti-colonial theory
   of global social justice, the reparative grammar of postcolonial justice
   is not sufficient to target current distributive inequalities that
   depend on existing infrastructures of domination. The latter cannot be
   repaired and should instead be abolished.},

Abstract = {This article explores the dynamics of policy change and innovation in
   the context of the security crises in Nuevo Le \& oacute;n, Mexico,
   drawing insight from past experiences and ongoing challenges. From 2003
   to 2023, with an emphasis on 2006-2011, the article examines the role of
   the state government and civil participation in shaping innovative
   policy responses. Key findings highlight the importance of collaboration
   between government, civil society, and the private sector in developing
   effective and sustainable solutions. While successful initiatives like
   the establishment of Fuerza Civil demonstrate the potential of public
   innovation, challenges such as funding uncertainties and changes in
   political leadership underscore the need for institutionalized
   mechanisms for collaboration and evaluation. The article concludes by
   emphasizing the importance of transparency, accountability, and
   inclusivity in policymaking processes; and advocating for continued
   civil engagement to address security challenges and foster a safer and
   more resilient future.

Title = {The financialization of housing and its political consequences},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 25},
Abstract = {Institutional investors in residential real estate have become targets
   of political backlash against unaffordable housing. We argue that this
   backlash is not only about economic issues such as rising rents; it
   reflects a fundamental rejection of ``financialized capitalism{''} that
   turns housing from a basic need into a speculative asset. Using novel
   geo-coded real estate transaction data, we document the extent of
   housing financialization cross-nationally and over time, and demonstrate
   that neighborhood-level exposure to financialization alone is
   insufficient to explain the widespread support to expropriate corporate
   landlords in a historic 2021 Berlin referendum. We then develop
   nationally representative surveys to show that German citizens
   conceptualize housing as a social right and hold the state responsible
   for its under-provision. We demonstrate experimentally that arguments
   about housing financialization significantly raise support for
   expropriation beyond rent effects. Our findings suggest that
   financialized capitalism can unite diverse groups of voters in favor of
   housing socialism.},

Title = {What can be learned about Australian values in comparing referendums on
   Indigenous inclusion and recognition?},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 23},
Abstract = {The referendum to establish a Voice to Parliament for Aboriginal and
   Torres Strait Islander peoples failed to receive popular support from
   the Australian public. Questions as to why the referendum was
   unsuccessful have been put forward following the outcome. As we analyse
   the defeat, it is useful to look back at the two other referendums in
   Australia's history that addressed inclusion and recognition of our
   First Peoples, 1967 and 1999, and compare factors which lead to their
   respective outcomes. Drawing on qualitative sources, this paper posits
   an argument which connects received national values to Australia's
   unwillingness to go beyond inclusion and recognise that Aboriginal and
   Torres Strait Islander people have inherent rights to be involved in
   decisions that affect them. Australian `egalitarianism' presents a
   barrier to greater Indigenous recognition, and referenda regarding
   Indigenous rights are impacted by discourses of `equality'.},

Title = {Sovereignism as a product of crises: a comparative analysis of German
   and Spanish parties and their use of sovereignist claims},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 15},
Abstract = {Sovereignism is frequently considered as an important phenomenon in
   political science but barely studied on its own. This paper understands
   sovereignism as a distinct concept and explores sovereignist claims
   comparing two different political systems. It addresses the
   yet-to-be-discovered link between crises and increase (or
   stagnancy/decrease) in the adoption of sovereignist claims by political
   parties. Following a framing approach, we examine the euro, migration
   and COVID-19 crises to capture how these crises were used by German and
   Spanish parties to shape sovereignist claims. The analysis confirms that
   these three crises facilitated discursive opportunities for an increased
   use of sovereignist claims. Although newly emerged radical parties are
   identified as the main discursive entrepreneurs, mainstream parties also
   accommodate the sovereignist discourse under certain conditions. This
   paper makes an important contribution to studies on sovereignism
   offering an analytical framework as well as fresh insights on the
   conditions for the adoption of sovereignism.},

Abstract = {Voters' perception of how satisfied they are with the work of the
   incumbent government is decisive for their voting decision, with
   satisfaction in most cases leading to support for the incumbent
   government and dissatisfaction leading to votes against it. This article
   is not about exploring the relationship between satisfaction with the
   incumbent party's performance and voting for it. The main objective is
   to identify the factors that contribute to voter satisfaction. What
   aspects of the incumbent government's performance or policy influence
   their positive assessment? Considering the election campaigns and
   prominent issues leading up to the elections and drawing insights from
   existing literature, this analysis examines the potential determinants
   of voter satisfaction. It aims to identify how these factors explain
   voter satisfaction or dissatisfaction. The findings reveal that voter
   satisfaction with the incumbent government during the 2024 Lok Sabha
   election was mainly influenced by recent and visible accomplishments
   rather than long-term factors. The construction of the Ram Mandir and
   positive evaluations of the government's performance on economic issues
   played a significant role in increasing satisfaction.},

Abstract = {Corruption remains a significant political issue in Central Europe. This
   article examines its salience in political discourse in Czechia and
   Slovakia, where recent anti-corruption campaigns have seen considerable
   success. Utilizing data from the Comparative Manifesto Project,
   ParlSpeech, and Slovak Parliamentary TV, the study finds that an
   oppositional stance is the primary predictor for frequent mentions of
   corruption rather than the anticipated role of populism. Populist
   parties then emphasize the issue more in parliamentary speeches than in
   their campaign promotions, though some specific nuances among different
   populist subtypes.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the debate on the role of religiosity in party
   competition in democratic political systems by analyzing the role of
   religious practice and belonging in the 2022 Italian elections. By using
   the newest Italian National Election Studies dataset, we combine
   indicators of both religious affiliation and practice to show how the
   electorates of the main Italian parties are composed in terms of voters'
   religiosity, to highlight how these differences influence the
   probability to vote for each of those parties and to further investigate
   the relationship between religious affiliation/practice and voting
   behavior. Results show the emergence of an increasingly identity-based
   relationship between religiosity and vote within the Italian context. We
   find that religiosity - in the form of Catholic affiliation - maintains
   a direct effect on vote choice which is also partially mediated by
   attitudinal indicators, such as those toward immigration, homosexuality,
   and abortion. We conclude that party competition in Italy is mainly
   fueled by identity dynamics - and less on religious practice or beliefs
   - concerning the whole group of those who identify as Catholics opposed
   to the group of those who do not.},

Abstract = {This article challenges prevailing national interpretations of
   solidarity by examining its colonial dimensions. Employing the
   Durkheimian school as a historical lens, I demonstrate how the colonial
   context during the Third Republic shaped the emergence and application
   of solidarity as a scientific concept. Informed by colonial
   ethnographies, solidarity was not merely a sociological self-description
   within European nations; it also formed part of political agendas beyond
   Europe. I illustrate how Durkheim's concept was utilized to enhance
   scientific understanding of colonized societies, aiding French colonial
   administrators in promoting developmentalist reforms. As national models
   extended internationally, solidarity evolved from social cohesion to
   economic integration within the international legal order. This
   progression toward modern solidarity-and the injustices it
   entailed-appeared inevitable, masking political struggles for
   self-determination. By critically recontextualizing solidarity, this
   analysis contributes to contemporary political theory debates,
   demonstrating its application in supporting an inclusive legal-economic
   agenda while failing to systematically confront colonial injustices.},

Abstract = {Like his predecessors, President Donald J. Trump deployed multiple
   unilateral tools to achieve policy goals that reflected campaign
   promises or emergent priorities that were unlikely to have successful
   legislative solutions. Congress, courts, and the public evaluate
   unilateral efforts in light of their own policy preferences. Here, we
   explore Trump's attempts to terminate Deferred Action for Childhood
   Arrivals (DACA) and the sensitivity of the public to those actions. Our
   public opinion data revealed a pattern of attentiveness to policy gain
   or loss on DACA. We find powerful effects on presidential approval and,
   to a lesser extent, vote choice for the 2020 presidential election. Our
   matching model reveals that one's approval of ending DACA generates an
   incentive for Trump to take unilateral action on that policy. Among
   voters with hardened policy positions, the demand for the policy outcome
   overrides concerns about how that outcome is achieved. Indeed,
   unilateralism might electorally advantage a president, at least among
   those voters who have strong policy commitments.},

Abstract = {Many studies have analysed what could motivate centre-right governments
   to develop progressive family policies, given their historically
   traditionalist ideology. Updating classic institutionalist accounts,
   this article expands the focus beyond centre-right parties formally in
   charge. It argues that in coalition and minority governments, partisan
   veto players may act as agenda-setters, design policy reforms and
   successfully exert pressure to approve them through three mechanisms:
   agreements for government formation, conditions for government survival
   and bureaucratic continuity. Drawing on novel empirical data from
   interviews and document analysis, this article applies deductive process
   tracing to analyse the German parental allowance reform of 2006 and the
   Spanish 2017 paternity leave extension. The findings complement existing
   studies that focus on the agency of centre-right parties as `
   protagonists ` of these reforms, arguing that in some cases they have
   instead ` consented ` to reforms proposed and supported by other
   parties.},

Abstract = {Do people think that some policies should be handled by the states,
   rather than the national government? In an era characterized by stark
   party polarization there is reason to suspect that attitudes regarding
   federalism are shaped by partisan considerations. Specifically, reported
   support for devolution may be driven by exposure to elite partisan cues
   and partisan reasoning tied to which political party devolution would
   empower. Using data from the 2022 Cooperative Election Study, we find
   that partisans tend to differ-often substantially-in their support for
   state-level decision-making regarding concrete policy proposals.
   However, these differences are largely driven by those who are most
   likely to be exposed to elite cues. We also find that, among both
   Democrats and Republicans, support for policy devolution is contingent
   on which party controls the state legislature in an individual's state.
   The findings suggest that partisanship plays a central role in shaping
   what the public says when asked about which level of government should
   determine whether to implement specific policy proposals.},

Journal = {GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {The world is currently on two divergent social protection trajectories,
   with high-income countries edging closer to universal coverage, while
   low-income countries have barely progressed since 2015. Under-investment
   in social protection, while not the only impediment, continues to be one
   of the main reasons for the low coverage rates. Public expenditure on
   social protection (excluding healthcare) was, on average, 13\% of gross
   domestic product (GDP) worldwide (in 2023). This average, however,
   conceals enormous inequalities. While high-income countries spend 16.4\%
   of GDP on social protection annually, upper-middle-income countries
   spend half of this amount (8.6\%), lower-middle-income countries only
   spend one quarter (4.1\%) and low-income countries less than one
   six-teenth (0.7\%) (Cattaneo et al., 2024).Recent International Labour
   Organization (ILO) estimates suggest that in low- and middle-income
   countries, there is a need to spend an additional USD 1.4 trillion or
   3.3\% of GDP (2024) to extend a social protection floor to all, with
   2.0\% of GDP required for essential healthcare and 1.3\% for the five
   key social protection cash benefits (Cattaneo et al., 2024).1 This means
   that governments of low- and middle-income countries should
   progressively increase their social protection expenditure by 10.6\% of
   their existing gov-ernment expenditure. In low-income countries,
   however, the financing gap is a stagger-ing 52.3\% of GDP and a striking
   310.0\% of current government expenditure. This shows that closing the
   financing gap is not possible without a massive sea-change in the
   domes-tic resource mobilization efforts of countries as well as in the
   global financial architec-ture so it can support, rather than hinder,
   national efforts.},

Abstract = {While the study of soft power has gained significant scholarly
   attention, an understanding of soft power politics in diverse state
   models, and multinational federations specifically, is lacking. This
   study remedies this gap by exploring the connection between soft power
   and multinational federalism in the Canadian context, highlighting the
   tensions between the Canadian federal ``majority{''} nation and Quebec's
   ``minority{''} nation. Relying on the international education policy
   sphere and its soft power potential, the study extends the discussion of
   soft power beyond the typical unitary nation-state lens, elucidating the
   interaction of multiple (and contrasting) soft power rationales within
   one country. The study reveals that soft power politics can be exerted
   as much domestically as externally and can be pursued in a discorded
   fashion within a nation-state. Clearly, there is a need for a more
   nuanced understanding of soft power, which considers its contested
   manifestation, and the context-specific ways it is utilized.},

Title = {Navigating Uncertainty: Rebel Risk Management Strategies during
   War-to-Peace Transitions},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 30},
Abstract = {This article explores the strategic decision making of armed groups
   during war-to-peace transitions-critical time frames during which
   militant leaders must reconcile their commitment to armed survival with
   the imperative of postwar civilian conversion. We specify the internal
   organizational risks rebel groups confront, as well as the menu of
   strategies from which they select, in navigating the uncertainty
   inherent in these perilous periods. Our approach broadens the analysis
   of war-to-peace transitions, offering new insights into the question of
   why rebels sometimes successfully integrate into postconflict politics,
   economies, and society, while at other times they forgo participation in
   the postconflict state. It represents the first step in a wider research
   program-one that promises to open a number of new directions in the
   study of insurgent organizations, transitional societies, and postwar
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Legislative staffers are an invisible force in legislative bodies that
   provide every imaginable service. It is doubtful that modern
   legislatures could operate without them. Prior studies of Congressional
   staffers have found evidence that staffers not only aid but also exert
   an independent influence on the policy-making process through network
   effects. In this article, I test if this extends to state legislative
   staffers using novel data from shared staffer networks in Arizona,
   Indiana, and New Mexico. I argue that, compared to their Congressional
   counterparts, state legislative staffers are more akin to ` clerks `
   than ` political professionals' and this limits their ability to
   independently influence policymaking at the state level.},

Abstract = {How do electoral manipulation and resulting anti-fraud protests
   influence political trust in non-democratic contexts? I leverage the
   plausibly exogenous variation in the timing of a series of original
   surveys fielded on nationally representative samples in Russia to
   understand the impact of political shocks - particularly allegations of
   electoral fraud and post-election protests - on the evolution of trust
   in political institutions and individuals. This study demonstrates that
   allegations of excessive, blatant electoral fraud decrease trust in the
   autocrat. However, trust rebounds following attendant post-election
   protests. Finally, I examine the conditional impacts of fraud and
   protest on trust, finding that updating occurs primarily among those
   with weak political affiliation.},

Abstract = {Despite its importance and prominence in public debates, including in
   many social science-related disciplines such as political science,
   anthropology, geography, and history, climate change has been unevenly
   addressed within critical sociology. In the tradition of critical
   theories, a critical sociology approach could contribute to climate
   science by discussing, for instance, what it means for societies and
   individuals to live together in times of ecological crisis and how this
   interplays with other crises and challenges of our time. As we face
   various transformations caused by climate change, sociology can inquire
   about social relations in the Anthropocene, including the critique of
   this concept and its alternatives, such as Capitalocene. This
   introductory article explores the intersection of sociology and the
   climate crisis, examining the sociological significance of the latter.
   It also discusses the importance for sociology, at both theoretical and
   empirical levels, to climate-related debates. It highlights the need for
   pluralistic approaches that can contribute to framing and addressing
   climate change, encompassing diagnosis, alternatives, science, and
   politics. The papers in this special issue seek to engage with and
   contribute to the abovementioned debate by covering theoretical and
   empirical perspectives on climate crisis, drawing attention to themes
   such as the relationship between critical theory and climate change,
   theories of modernity, the notion of (post)sustainability, just
   transitions, the role of media systems in fostering sustainable
   transformations, and the contribution of social movements to
   socioecological transformation, with a particular focus on the `Global
   South'.},

Abstract = {Many previous studies have shown that public service motivation (PSM) is
   associated with public sector employment. However, with few exceptions,
   such studies have focused on unelected positions in public sector
   bureaucracies, despite many other avenues for public service. Using a
   nationally representative survey of United States respondents, a survey
   of federal bureaucrats, and a survey of law students, we show that PSM
   is associated with ambition for holding elected office, high-level
   public sector positions, and judicial positions, at least in the United
   States. Moreover, the results are broadly comparable across different
   types of ambition (i.e., bureaucratic, electoral, and judicial),
   suggesting that the PSM dimensions-and especially Attraction to Policy
   Making (APM)-transcend institutions in explaining individuals' interest
   in service in public sector offices of all types.},

   Against the FARC in Southern Tolima, Colombia},
Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 27},
Abstract = {Why do civilians engage in Civilian Defence Forces (CDFs) to confront
   insurgents if it is more dangerous than pacific resistance? This paper
   addresses two cases of peasant-centric CDFs in southern Tolima,
   Colombia. Based on secondary sources and interviews, a rich historical
   account of the CDFs is presented, allowing the application of process
   tracing for analysis. A framework to explain CDFs, recognising the
   interweaving of local security dilemmas and the macro-cleavage of the
   civil war, is proposed. Three determinants were found: previous
   participation of civilians in organised violence, legitimation of
   violent responses and the cooptation of community conflict resolution
   institutions.},

Abstract = {How much autonomy elected representatives should have in looking after
   the interests of their constituents is a central question of democratic
   theory. While much research has been conducted on the representational
   roles adopted by elected representatives, we currently lack an
   understanding of citizens' preferences for contrasting models of
   representation, more specifically whether they believe representatives
   should primarily act as instructed delegates, closely following public
   opinion or rather as trustees, relying on their own convictions and
   judgement. As a result, we know relatively little about how congruent
   citizens' and politicians' representational preferences are, whether
   some subgroups of citizens and politicians are more congruent with each
   other than others and whether citizens' and politicians'
   representational preferences are driven by the same determinants. Using
   data from 13 countries, we assess the level of congruence between
   voters' and MPs' preferences in representational style. In all
   countries, citizens favouring delegate-style MPs are poorly represented
   as the vast majority of representatives display a moderate to strong
   preference for trusteeship. Analysing subgroups of politicians and
   citizens according to party family, ideology, inclusion in government,
   populism and social class reveals that MPs from left-wing or right-wing
   radical and populist parties, representatives sitting on the opposition
   benches and those belonging to lower classes tend to hold
   representational preferences that are more in line with the preferences
   of their own supporters or individuals belonging to the same group as
   themselves, but also with those of the entire electorate. However, even
   among these politicians there are few delegates. Examining whether
   citizens' and politicians' representational preferences are driven by
   similar determinants, we assessed the influence of their ideological
   orientations, socioeconomic status and support for (or affiliation with)
   a party in government on their representational preferences. For
   citizens, our results indicate that locating oneself on the right of the
   ideological spectrum is related to higher scores on the delegate-trustee
   scale, while supporting a populist party seems to decrease voters'
   favourability toward trusteeship. Politicians' preferences could not be
   explained by similar factors as none of the tested factors were
   significant. In line with our congruence analysis, there seems to be
   little variation in MPs' representational preferences. Even groups of
   MPs that can be thought of as most likely to be delegates turn out to be
   staunch trustees, potentially causing frustration among citizens
   preferring delegate-style representation.},

Abstract = {The neologism ``mansplaining{''} captures an insidious dynamic in which
   men explain things to women that women already understand, assuming
   that, by virtue of being a woman, she lacks the man's knowledge.
   Mansplaining has started to receive some attention in contemporary
   scholarship, conceptualizing the phenomenon and identifying its
   epistemic harm. My purpose is to consider mansplaining and its harms
   from the perspective of democratic theory. Setting the problem of
   mansplaining against the norms we expect of democracy-equality,
   inclusion, and recognition-I argue that mansplaining poses harms that
   are not only individual and epistemic but also collective and
   relational. I distinguish two types of mansplaining based on women's
   expertise and experience to elaborate on its collective epistemic harms
   to decision making and its relational harm of political exclusion.
   Mansplaining poses further relational harms of inequality and
   misrecognition, undermining the equal social relations and social trust
   required for deliberation.},

Abstract = {Rising loneliness in the Western world has weakened social networks and
   reduced interpersonal trust. Concurrently, malign information influence
   (MII) has become more pervasive. Albin \& Ouml;stervall and Charlotte
   Wagnsson synthesise literature from multiple fields to argue that
   loneliness may heighten susceptibility to MII, and that Russia, as a key
   disseminator of MII, is both exploiting and exacerbating Western
   loneliness. They explore how these dynamics impact personal and societal
   MII resilience.},

Title = {Return to utopia? Vision and practice of the Japanese right at Yasukuni
   shrine},

Abstract = {The Shinto shrine Yasukuni has drawn international attention as a
   controversial site for its enshrinement of convicted war criminals and
   glorification of Japanese colonialism. Every year on the anniversary of
   Japan's surrender in 1945, it draws a festival-like crowd; among the
   crowd are right-wing political activists, individuals in military
   regalia, and representatives of right-wing organizations dressed in
   pseudo-militaristic uniforms performing monologues and marching in
   formation, among other activities. This article examines the meaning and
   ideology underpinning the (re)enactment of Japanese empire and war at
   Yasukuni shrine. In Japan, the far-right have appropriated Shinto as a
   pillar of an imagined, lost `tradition' which must be resuscitated to
   save society from moral and political collapse. The article argues that
   despite its call to the past, this imaginary emerges as an ontological
   and epistemological challenge to the secularization and liberalization
   which took place in the decades following World War II. Yasukuni is
   positioned as both the inspiration for, and location of, this
   utopianism. More than escapism, the enactment of utopia at the shrine
   embodies an active project to win the hearts and minds of the Japanese
   people, the ultimate aim of which is to construct an anti-secular,
   reactionary and illiberal social order.},

Abstract = {This article explores the utility of punctuated equilibrium (PE) theory
   in explaining revolutionary organizational change in the public sector
   and its effects on policy implementation, with a focus on the United
   States Coast Guard. We illustrate our model using data from in-depth
   interviews with current and former senior Coast Guard officers and
   enlisted personnel, as well as secondary sources such as historical
   accounts and budget data. Through content analysis, we argue that PE
   theory begins with a change in the public sector organization's external
   environment, which then affects organizational strategy, structure,
   power distribution, and outputs. Punctuated equilibrium theory proves to
   be a valuable lens for understanding policy outputs in relation to
   organizational change.},

Title = {Masking turnout inequality. Invalid voting and class bias when
   compulsory voting is reinstated},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {92},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Compulsory voting increases turnout. However, this does not imply that
   CV reduces the socioeconomic gap among voters. While conventional
   accounts argue that CV corrects turnout inequality, some literature
   challenges such effect because CV also increases invalid voting. We
   evaluate the empirical merits of these theories turning to the case of
   Chile. We compare the results of the Constitutional referendums in 2020
   -with voluntary voting- and 2022 -under mandatory rules. We report the
   transition to CV (1) boosted turnout; (2) reduced the class-biased
   turnout; (3) increased invalid voting, yet wasn't socioeconomically
   biased in all municipalities; (4) invalid voting inequality emerged when
   dividing municipalities into those within and outside the Metropolitan
   Region. These findings hold for the 2021 -with VV- and 2023
   constitutional representative elections -under CV. Our results show that
   CV raised participation and reduced class-biased turnout, but it doesn't
   automatically correct inequalities, as it produces heterogeneous effects
   over invalid voting.},

Abstract = {U.S. universities devote substantial resources to increasing student
   political engagement, especially voting; research identifies several
   factors affecting student political participation, including
   socialization theories (e.g. family, friends, school), distance from
   home (Niemi and Hanmer), and choice architecture (Thaler, Sunstein, and
   Balz). Other research suggests that increased party polarization leads
   to higher voter turnout (Abramowitz and Stone; Crepaz). Our study sought
   to understand student political behavior (voting and registration) and
   political polarization during fall 2020 in the context of a polarized
   nation and an international pandemic. Based on 326 surveys of
   undergraduates and in-depth follow-up interviews, where 85\% of our
   student sample reported voting, results suggest support for several
   factors that contribute to voting: level of political information
   efficacy, participation in campus organizations and events, friends, and
   family. On measures of social distance ({''}polarization{''}),
   participants felt more distant from Trump and less distant from Biden,
   and participants who felt closer to Biden felt significantly more
   prepared to vote than participants who felt distant to Biden.
   Surprisingly, minority students were less likely to vote. A second
   analysis compared a subsample of student fraternity/sorority members
   ({''}Greek{''} members) from 2016 and those from 2020. The 2020 Greek
   members voted at higher rates and were more active on social media
   although voter registration rates did not differ. Results suggest that
   several factors contributed to student voting in our sample:
   parent/family encouragement, a cultivated campus voting culture, campus
   outreach efforts to first year students, and increased voting avenues
   during the pandemic.},

Title = {Refugee Protection as a Public Good: What Benefits Do States Derive?},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 15},
Abstract = {While a growing number of refugees is in need of humanitarian
   protection, most states are reluctant to admit them. For more than two
   decades, scholars have thought to understand this intricate challenge of
   international governance through the prism of collective action theory
   and the concept of refugee protection as an international public good.
   However, the specific benefits that states gain from refugee protection
   and that are assumed to constitute the public good remain surprisingly
   vague and under-specified. In this Reflection, we make three
   contributions to address this issue. First, we take stock of the
   literature and assess the evolution of the collective action theory in
   asylum governance. Second, we identify and conceptualize legitimacy,
   security, reputation, and development as four types of benefits that
   states derive from refugee protection. Third, we discuss the limitations
   of the dominant rational-choice approach and contend that the nature of
   refugee protection in the international realm is the product of
   international and domestic politics based on the contestation of
   interests and norms. These insights result in a series of
   recommendations for future research of refugee protection as a
   collective action problem.},

Abstract = {Africa is by all accounts one of the richest continents but also
   displays the worst in human security indexes. During colonisation, the
   continent was characterised by the lack of peace, insecurity and
   underdevelopment. Moreover, with the demise of colonialism, Africa
   became a geo-political stake in the rivalries of the Cold War era in a
   bipolar world. The main casualty in this rivalry was human security on
   the African continent. Internally, challenges of governance, resources
   lost to the continent owing to illicit financial flows and the inability
   of civil society to hold African states to account have also conspired
   to undermine human security broadly as Africans are not free from want
   and from fear. Considering the above, Africa remains an underdog in
   international politics with minimal influence in international
   organisations and even with less effective influence in
   operationalisation of international politics. In internal matters,
   Africa has also failed to ensure human security as a new paradigm for
   the continent's realisation of peace, security and development
   imperatives. Employing qualitative methodology and using secondary data,
   this conceptual article discusses the need for repositioning African
   states to prudently engage the global (dis)order and advance peace,
   security and development.},

Abstract = {While much research has been devoted to the institutional determinants
   of corruption in democracies, debates continue regarding the merits of
   distributing executive power horizontally (presidentialism vs.
   parliamentarism) and vertically (federalism vs. unitarism). Taking
   advantage of the rich empirical literature on the subject, we
   investigate the effects of institutional features on corruption applying
   a meta-analytical framework to over 1000 estimates across 71 studies
   conducted over three decades. Results show a consistent positive
   association between presidentialism and corruption and that much of the
   confusion around decentralization can be explained by the distinction
   between its fiscal and political forms; political decentralization has a
   marginal positive association, while fiscal decentralization has a
   negative effect. A series of moderator analyses reveal the sensitivity
   of many of these findings to research design choices made in conducting
   the studies, such as the temporal and spatial coverage of the sample and
   the selection of co-parameters in statistical tests.},

Title = {Building democratic resilience: the impact of political engagement
   during education on xenophobia and political trust},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 3},
Abstract = {This study examines the relationships between political engagement in
   school or university such as serving as speaker of class or organizing
   political events and xenophobia and political trust. Following
   interactionist socialization theory, political engagement during
   adolescence should shape ideas of citizenship, democracy, and equality
   and, thus, foster democratic resilience. Schools and universities are
   arguably key institutions to build trust in political systems and
   counter-authoritarian dynamics if they provide space for learning
   democracy by doing. The paper shows that, indeed, political engagement
   in the context of school or university limits xenophobic views and
   increases political trust. It further affirms that experiencing efficacy
   prevents perceiving immigrants as a threat. The original finding that
   political trust mediates the association between democratic experience
   and xenophobia further supports this reading. The paper provides
   evidence from nine European countries (including quotas for young
   people) for the importance of experiencing democracy through direct
   engagement at a young age.},

Title = {Favoring ingroups, derogating from outgroups: how populist parties in
   Belgium polarize on social media},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 3},
Abstract = {In a context of increasing polarization, this study proposes to clarify
   the way populist parties cultivate vertical (people vs. elites) and
   horizontal (between different groups in society) opposition in their
   online communication. Relying on Social Identity Theory (SIT) and on the
   concept of claim of representation, this article investigates to what
   extent left-wing (LWPP) and right-wing (RWPP) populist parties in
   Belgium create antagonisms in their online communication. Expectations
   are threefold. First, ingroup appeal and outgroup derogation should be
   more present in social media messages of populist parties than in
   non-populist ones. Second, both LWPPs and RWPPs should oppose groups
   vertically as well as horizontally. Third, the nature of these groups
   should be conditional upon their respective ideology-namely, socialism
   on one side, and nativism on the other. To this end, the article
   analyzes 13 months of X posts by all 13 parliamentary parties and their
   presidents (N = 12,303), during a routine period (January 2023-January
   2024). Our findings first reveal that populist parties, and especially
   RWPPs, are more likely to resort to outgroup derogation compared to
   non-populist parties. Second, regarding the vertical antagonism, our
   analysis points out the intertwined effect of populism and incumbency.
   Third, the nature of group appeals greatly differs between LWPPs and
   RWPPs, in connection with their core ideology.},

   investment},
Journal = {DYNAMICS OF ASYMMETRIC CONFLICT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 2},
Abstract = {Why do terrorist groups perpetrate suicide attacks? Political scientists
   maintain that terrorist groups adopt suicide terrorism for its strategic
   benefits. Yet previous studies have not demonstrated that suicide
   terrorism outperforms conventional terrorism. In fact, the most
   prominent studies do not even systematically compare the strategic
   effects of suicide terrorism to conventional terrorism to justify the
   cost. To date, the presumed strategic utility of suicide terrorism
   remains elusive. Although economists have assessed the impact of
   terrorism broadly on various economic measures, our study is the first
   to rigorously compare the effects of suicide terrorism to conventional
   terrorism on foreign direct investment. Consistent with bargaining
   theory, we find robust evidence that suicide terrorism ``works{''} by
   depressing more than conventional attacks FDI in the target country.
   This effect is strong across PCSE model specifications, particularly in
   target countries weaker at counterterrorism. The study has important
   implications for both terrorism studies and international business.},

Abstract = {The book Global Libidinal Economy addresses the question of what
   psychoanalysis contributes to political economy and contemporary social
   theory. The authors engage with Marxian political economy, asserting
   that the libidinal dimension-encompassing desire, drive, and
   fantasies-shapes the social world, including the economy. Throughout,
   the authors provide a provocative answer to this question by identifying
   the libidinal stakes across a range of issues, including economic
   development, trade, environmental governance, technological innovation,
   and the rivalry between the United States and China, a shift of emphasis
   that opens the economy to political possibilities. This essay explores
   resonances with other psychoanalytically informed approaches to Marxian
   theory, exemplified by Anjan Chakrabarti, Anup Dhar, and Stephen
   Cullenberg. These theorists envision the majority world as a locus of
   potential, emphasizing a noncapitalist orientation, termed the World of
   the Third, to extend the possibilities for postcapitalist politics and a
   politics of solidarity.},

Abstract = {Many Western Marxists have jettisoned the concepts of imperialism while
   retaining opposition to actually existing socialist projects of the
   Global South. This paper asserts that the failure to critique
   imperialism and to support socialist projects in the Global South is
   grounded in a rejection of classical Marxist human relations to nature
   and a failure to contemplate the continuance of state-socialist projects
   in the Global South. Since the 1990s, Western Marxists have replaced
   imperialism with global capitalism that is untethered to Western
   imperialism. Western Marxists have also deemed socialist projects as a
   betrayal of their utopian views rooted in the Hegelian ``purity
   fetish.{''} Instead, some Western Marxists have aligned with imperialist
   states in support of political and economic intervention against
   countries they view as failed projects, often leading to the reassertion
   of imperialist domination. Consequently, Western Marxists blindly
   support Western policies which undermine socialist state projects and
   wittingly or unwittingly, the reassertion of economic, political,
   cultural and military dependency on imperialist capitalism.},

Abstract = {Referendums differ from general elections in the choices that are
   offered to voters and in the cues that are available to them to reach a
   decision. This difference makes the quantity and quality of the
   information that is available during a referendum campaign crucial to
   the outcome. This paper uses a unique panel survey to examine the role
   of the campaign in shaping the outcome of the October 2023 Voice to
   Parliament referendum. We find that the political cues offered to voters
   - reflected most prominently in voters' views about the major party
   leaders - were the most important campaign effects shaping the result.
   Interpersonal communication also mattered, but government-supplied
   information and mass media exposure had no effect. The findings
   highlight the central role that a campaign driven by elites plays in
   shaping the outcome of a referendum.},

Abstract = {Tens of millions of individuals are displaced due to violence, and most
   are hosted by other households in their home countries. We ask what
   motivates people to host the forcibly displaced. We are interested in
   whether empathy increases the willingness to host but also consider
   alternative explanations. To explore the correlates of hosting we
   collected survey data from 1,504 households in the Democratic Republic
   of the Congo, fielded in-depth interviews, and implemented an
   experiment. We employ a novel strategy to measure hosting behavior,
   where household characteristics are measured prior to the arrival of
   displaced persons. We find that households with higher empathy are more
   likely to host in the 10-month period following the survey. There is no
   evidence that ethnicity, religiosity, or wealth affect hosting behavior.
   Results from the experiment suggest that it is difficult to increase
   hosting propensity in the longer term (4+ months) through simple
   interventions.},

Abstract = {Applying racial stereotypes and the racial threat framework to felon
   disenfranchisement support, this study argues white Americans who think
   Black Americans are more violent will be more supportive of felon
   disenfranchisement, and that this effect will be largest for white
   Republicans and white Americans who put greater importance in their
   racial identity. Analyses of the 2020 American National Election Study
   finds white Americans who think Black (white) Americans are more violent
   are more (less) supportive of felon disenfranchisement, with suggestive
   evidence these effects are more pronounced for white Republicans and
   white Americans holding greater racial importance. At the same time, the
   effects of violence stereotypes are consistently substantively small,
   amounting to less than one half of one level change in
   disenfranchisement support on a seven-point scale. These effect sizes
   are on par with partisanship, slightly smaller than other racial
   attitudes and crime spending preferences, and far outpaced by ideology.
   Overall, these results suggest racial stereotypes may factor into
   support for felon disenfranchisement, but these stereotypes are not a
   driving factor of such support.},

Abstract = {This article explores how populist attitudes are correlated with foreign
   policy postures at the public level in four European countries: France,
   Germany, Great Britain, and Italy. We provide first evidence
   adjudicating between two rivalling perspectives. One perspective focuses
   on the ideational core of populism and argues that it entails
   substantive beliefs and values that may inform foreign policy
   preferences - just like any other ideology. Another perspective focuses
   on the thin-centredness of populism and argues that no policy
   implications can be derived from populist ideas. Analysing original
   survey data, we find strong and consistent associations of populist
   attitudes with two foreign policy postures, militant internationalism
   and isolationism, and weaker and less systematic associations with two
   others, cooperative internationalism and global justice orientations.
   Importantly, these patterns are independent of host ideologies. We
   discuss the implications of these findings for the question of how
   ``thick{''} populism is and what that may mean for the politics of
   (European) foreign policies in times of a continuing populist Zeitgeist.},

Abstract = {Before policy reform initiatives reach the agenda of national decision
   makers, such initiatives often start at a small- scale, local level. The
   Programmatic Action Framework (PAF) emphasizes the importance of
   biographical connections to understand how a group of policy actors
   forms, and how it develops programs that may lead to decade- long policy
   change. This article applies the PAF to study the emergence of a
   programmatic group behind initiatives on regionalization in German
   health policy through discourse analysis and expert interviews. The
   study contributes to understanding social networks behind policy
   programs and social- psychological, partly informal drivers of policy
   change. The results show that many PAF conditions have already been met
   in the German health policy subsystem. We describe a network of policy
   actors with local and organizational drivers that has led to nationwide
   cooperation on regionalization.},

Abstract = {Welfare programs in emerging economies are, in most cases, highly
   selective. This article illustrates this point by exploring Cambodia's
   emergency cash assistance scheme coverage for workers affected by the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on policy analysis and interviews with
   govern-ment officials, industry representatives, and garment and tourism
   unions, it analyzes the level of benefit and efficacy of the initiative
   for different groups of workers. Based on this analysis, we find that
   garment factory and tourism workers received better support than workers
   in other sectors as a consequence of industry lobbying and strategic
   decision-making on the part of the government designed to mitigate the
   impact of the pandemic on those sectors. Our analysis also reveals,
   however, that the rela-tively informal nature of even formal-sector
   workplaces in Cambodia meant that the scheme's impact was highly varied
   even among these targeted groups of workers. We conclude with a
   discussion of the findings' broader implications.},

Abstract = {Democratic stability hinges on voters' commitment to democratic norms,
   yet there are many examples of voters' willingness to tolerate
   politicians who violate such principles. This article examines whether
   critical responses by other politicians can effectively counter the
   appeal of political candidates who have engaged in authoritarian
   behavior. We argue that costly action by fellow partisan politicians can
   reduce the electoral popularity of authoritarian politicians. We test
   this in a preregistered conjoint experiment embedded in a nationally
   representative survey in the United Kingdom. The results show that
   voters are less likely to choose politicians displaying authoritarian
   behavior, when they are criticized by other legislators, and that such
   counteractions are particularly effective when they are costly. These
   findings have important implications, as they show that politicians,
   especially co-partisans, can play an important role in reducing the
   appeal of authoritarian politicians.},

Title = {Interrogating the feasibility and efficacy of devolved regional
   governments in Zimbabwe},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 10},
Abstract = {Devolution of power to regional governments is a dominant political
   issue. In pursuit of this paradigm, Zimbabwe enshrined regional
   governments in the Constitution. Deontological and consequentialist
   perspectives underpinning devolution view regional governments as
   vehicles for deepening democracy and promoting development. This stems
   from the potential of regional governments to harness local resources
   and stimulate robust public participation. Using a desktop review, the
   paper examines (a) the feasibility and efficacy of regional governments
   in promoting socio-economic and political transformation and (b) delays
   in the creation of regional governments in terms of the constitution.
   The analysis reveals that the development of regional governments in
   Zimbabwe is mired in constitutional ambiguity emanating from a vague
   definition of their purpose and funding. In the same context, the
   pro-unitary Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF)
   government is opposed to devolution viewing the concept, albeit
   conveniently, as a secessionist principle that carries the baggage of
   federalism.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate the asymmetric effect of military
   expenditure on economic growth in Nigeria. Furthermore, it determines
   the threshold level of military expenditure that spurs or hinders
   economic growth in Nigeria. To achieve the study's objectives, the
   nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) and dynamic threshold
   autoregressive (TAR) techniques are applied as estimation techniques to
   data from 1981 to 2020. The findings from the study show that (1)
   positive shocks in military expenditure negatively impact economic
   growth in the short run, while the effect turns positive in the long
   run. (2) Negative military expenditure shocks negatively influenced
   economic growth in Nigeria in both periods. (3) The result from the
   threshold regression found a threshold value of 0.579 for military
   expenditure. Based on these findings, policymakers must consider the
   inherent tendency of asymmetry and nonlinearity in military expenditure
   when formulating policies related to government spending.},

Title = {Precarity and political protest},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 9},
Abstract = {How does precarity in the labour market affect political engagement?
   Considering the negative impact of unemployment and atypical employment
   on turnout, existing research suggests that precarity depresses
   political participation. However, participation through voting is
   dependent on supply-side factors and might be an insufficient indicator
   of engagement with politics. To improve our understanding of this
   matter, this article investigates the relationship between precarity and
   protest behaviour, as well as the moderating impact of individual and
   contextual factors on this relationship. The analysis relies on survey
   data from thirteen Western European democracies and on a novel
   operationalisation of precarity that, through the implementation of
   Bayesian inference techniques on EU-LFS data, allows the capturing of
   individuals' vulnerability in the labour market. The results reveal that
   precarity increases the propensity to protest, exposing the mobilisation
   potential of precarious workers and suggesting that the representation
   of this expanding social group might be beneficial for vote-maximizing
   parties.},

Abstract = {Does the ethnic media promote the political engagement of minority
   ethnic immigrants? This is a salient question in Western democracies,
   where the political incorporation of immigrants is a continuous
   challenge. Prevailing accounts place the media as a primary cause of
   growing public disengagement. In contrast, this article argues that the
   entry of community-centered ethnic media can increase immigrants'
   political engagement by changing their informational environment and
   their representation in media and state institutions. In 2004, the UK
   Parliament enacted the Community Radio Order to allow the licensing of
   community radio stations. Leveraging the introduction of this law and
   geographical variation in the distribution of licenses with a
   difference-in-differences approach, this article shows that the exposure
   of minority ethnic immigrants to radio programming targeted at their
   community substantively increases their turnout in local elections. The
   results suggest that immigrants' participation in politics is stimulated
   by accommodating diversity within common institutions.},

Abstract = {Interest groups are often included as key actors in consultation
   processes, with the aim of making policy more effective, fair and
   representative. At the same time, their influence is frequently viewed
   with suspicion. This research note uses survey experiments in Germany,
   the United Kingdom and the United States (N = 9,357) to explore how the
   ties citizens hold to different types of interest groups affect their
   perceived legitimacy of involving them in parliamentary hearings. We
   find that affective, behavioural and attitudinal ties shape how citizens
   evaluate the representation of groups, but that there are important
   differences between ties to different group types: ties to cause groups
   representing societal interests are more consequential than ties to
   business interests. These findings underline important heterogeneity in
   how different interest groups relate to their constituencies and have
   implications for accountability relationships between citizens and
   policymakers. The heightened sensitivity of citizens with ties to cause
   groups regarding their representation underscores the need to actively
   nurture and involve these groups in policy making.},

Abstract = {Brans and Timmermans respond to Flinders' concerns about the potential
   irrelevance of political science due to the pressures of impact regimes.
   Based on a 2018 survey of 12,400 European political scientists, they
   show that 80\% of political scientists actively engage in policy
   advising. They identify four advisory roles: Pure Academic, Expert,
   Opinionating Scholar, and Public Intellectual, with most political
   scientists fitting the Opinionating Scholar type. Contrary to Flinders'
   fears of depoliticization, most political scientists make normative
   statements and engage on intrinsically political topics. Rather than
   being confined to a dyadic relationship with policymakers, their
   engagements are diverse, targeting civil society actors, government
   agencies, and think tanks. They are moreover driven by professional duty
   rather than extrinsic incentives. Based on the study's results the
   contribution refutes the notion that increased policy engagement leads
   to irrelevance: political scientists have the potential to maintain
   criticality and influence in policy advisory systems across Europe.},

Title = {The personalization of government: concept and comparative analysis},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 21},
Abstract = {The personalization of politics is one of the most important political
   phenomena of our time. Following the decline of traditional party
   government, various political systems have seen a radical shift of power
   from collective to individual actors. In this context, one of the main
   forms of the personalization of politics is the personalization of
   government. Heads of government have become more central to democratic
   executives due to their direct relationship with citizens, their greater
   control over government action, and structural changes in the
   institutional setting in which they operate. Although a large body of
   comparative evidence seems to support this trend, the existing
   literature has not yet offered a precise conceptual lens through which
   to do a detailed analysis of this transformation over time. This article
   introduces the concept of ``monocratic government{''} as a way to study
   the personalization of government in terms of the ability of leaders to
   create consensus and use their powers effectively, and to analyse other
   contextual factors such as the party-system and executive-legislative
   relations. The last section analyses the Italian Republic over different
   time periods, paving the way for further comparative analysis.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The potential for ``not-in-my-backyard{''} (NIMBY) sentiments to shape
   public attitudes is well-documented. However, to date, research on
   NIMBYism has focused on attitudes about building substantial
   infrastructure that may undermine property values (e.g., wind turbines;
   affordable housing) and the opening of facilities like homeless shelters
   or drug rehabilitation centers that residents may fear will attract
   unsavory clientele to their neighborhood. Here we demonstrate that NIMBY
   considerations can also shape attitudes about a ``hot button{''} social
   issue that is typically not thought of in NIMBY terms: abortion policy.
   We show that residents of an urban area adjacent to states that recently
   imposed restrictive abortion policies are less supportive of
   facilitating abortion access for out-of-state patients when those
   services would be provided in their own neighborhood, as opposed to in
   their state.},

Abstract = {How can UK and devolved governments be more effective when addressing
   chronic problems like inequalities or crises like climate change? The
   dominant story is of pessimism: policymaking is bound to a Westminster
   tradition of short-termism, elitism, and centralization, and reform
   efforts are doomed to failure. We present a more cautiously optimistic
   account about the prospects for a more effective government, grounded in
   theory-informed lessons from two decades of UK and devolved government
   reform efforts. We describe a potentially more innovative and less
   blundering state and present a coherent Positive Public Policy agenda
   that can help to realize this potential.},

Abstract = {Instrumental variable (IV) analysis relies on the exclusion
   restriction-that the instrument only affects the dependent variable via
   its relationship with the independent variable and not via other causal
   routes. However, scholars generally justify the exclusion restriction
   based on its plausibility. I propose a method for searching for
   additional violations implied by existing social science studies. I show
   that the use of weather to instrument different independent variables
   represents strong prima facie evidence of exclusion-restriction
   violations for all weather-IV studies. A review of 289 studies reveals
   194 variables previously linked to weather: all representing potential
   exclusion-restriction violations. Using sensitivity analysis, I show
   that the magnitude of many of these violations is sufficient to overturn
   numerous existing IV results. I conclude with practical steps to
   systematically review existing literature to identify and quantify
   possible exclusion-restriction violations when using IV designs.},

Abstract = {This article presents an alternative general model of democracy to
   traditional minimalist (electoral and liberal) and deliberative theories
   by drawing from critical realist philosophical thought. Realist or real
   democracy is proposed as a societal system where preconditions exist to
   fully empower all citizens to realize their individual capabilities.
   This includes empowerment opportunities at the ballot box - but also
   other preconditions such as health, educational and living standards.
   Real democracy also separates democratic preconditions from democratic
   outcomes. Democratic outcomes require the absence of inequalities in
   power as result from the contingent interaction preconditions and human
   agency. The new approach is argued to provide a more holistic and
   dynamic concept of democracy which is also more grounded in the everyday
   experience of the citizen compared to traditional approaches. It
   reconnects democracy with theories of human development and enables a
   new classification of political regimes and conception of democratic
   politics. An initial empirical mapping of patterns of global real
   democracy shows evidence of rising preconditions since 1990 - but
   stagnation since 2010 and some signs of decline. Democratic outcomes by
   socio-economic position saw the most notable decline.},

Abstract = {American voters consume an astounding amount of entertainment media, yet
   its political consequences are often neglected. We argue that this
   ostensibly apolitical content can create unique opportunities for
   politicians to build parasocial ties with voters. We study this question
   in the context of Donald Trump's unconventional political trajectory and
   investigate the electoral consequences of The Apprentice. Using an array
   of data-content analysis, surveys, Twitter data, open-ended answers-we
   investigate how this TV program helped Trump brand himself as a
   competent leader and foster viewers' trust in him. Exploiting the
   geographic variation in NBC channel inertia, we find that exposure to
   The Apprentice increased Donald Trump's electoral performance in the
   2016 Republican primary. We discuss the implications of these findings
   in light of the rise of nonconventional politicians in this golden age
   of entertainment.},

Abstract = {This article examines four potential strategies of the Brazilian welfare
   system in the face of increasing liberalization and globalization since
   the 1970s. We test whether liberalization and economic globalization
   hurt the expansion of social expenditure (the efficiency hypothesis or
   race to the bottom hypothesis) or whether the welfare system expands as
   a response to the volatility caused by liberalization and globalization
   (compensation hypothesis). We employ time-series regression analysis to
   panel data from 1970 to 2015. We controlled for economic (wealth and GDP
   growth) and political factors (strength of the left and effective
   competition of parties in the lower house). We identify different
   strategies followed by the welfare system through the period analyzed.
   However, two strategies are dominant in the long run: A neoliberal
   strategy when the impact of globalization is considered (efficiency
   hypothesis) and an embedded neoliberal strategy when the effect of
   liberalization is pondered (compensation hypothesis).
   Este art \& iacute;culo examina cuatro posibles estrategias del sistema
   de bienestar social brasile \& ntilde;o ante la creciente liberalizaci
   \& oacute;n y globalizaci \& oacute;n desde la d \& eacute;cada de 1970.
   Probamos si la liberalizaci \& oacute;n y la globalizaci \& oacute;n
   econ \& oacute;mica perjudican la expansi \& oacute;n del gasto social
   (hip \& oacute;tesis de la eficiencia o carrera hacia el fondo) o si el
   sistema de bienestar se expande como respuesta a la volatilidad causada
   por la liberalizaci \& oacute;n y la globalizaci \& oacute;n (hip \&
   oacute;tesis de la compensaci \& oacute;n). Empleamos un an \&
   aacute;lisis de regresi \& oacute;n de series temporales con datos de
   panel de 1970-2015. Controlamos factores econ \& oacute;micos
   (crecimiento econ \& oacute;mico y riqueza) y pol \& iacute;ticos
   (fuerza de la izquierda y competencia efectiva de los partidos en la c
   \& aacute;mara baja). Podemos identificar diferentes estrategias
   seguidas por el sistema de bienestar, aunque dos estrategias son
   dominantes a largo plazo: una estrategia neoliberal cuando se considera
   el impacto de la globalizaci \& oacute;n (hip \& oacute;tesis de la
   eficiencia) y una estrategia neoliberal incrustada cuando se pondera el
   efecto de la liberalizaci \& oacute;n (hip \& oacute;tesis de la
   compensaci \& oacute;n).},

Abstract = {Hate speech psychologically harms its targeted people. It sometimes
   leads to hate crimes, which threatens social stability and harmony.
   Counterspeech is a communicative activity refuting hate speech. Scholars
   disagree on whether counterspeech-making behavior belongs to political
   participation, and their disagreements influence empirical studies on
   political participation. This paper uses Hannah Arendt's conception of
   politics to investigate the nature of counterspeech-making behavior. It
   argues that this behavior is a form of political participation because
   it contains intrinsic political values and politics-oriented
   instrumental goals. The analysis broadens our knowledge of political
   participation and deepens our understanding of hate speech and
   counterspeech.},

Abstract = {Maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea is a challenge that straddles
   multiple players and sectors, and crimes like piracy cause disruptions
   to international trade and shipping. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the
   global shipping industry tried to keep maritime security on the agenda,
   while advocating for global security assemblages, specifically,
   transnational policing initiatives as part of the maritime security
   governance. Using the notion of narratives and assemblage thinking, it
   is argued that although global shipping and Ghanaian state agents agree
   on the problem, they differ on which maritime security governance
   infrastructure to deploy, resulting in tensions between the two parties.},

Abstract = {Political consumerism has emerged as a popular form of participation
   among lay citizens. For the most part, research has delved into the main
   antecedents that explain this type of consumption. However, research has
   generally neglected to consider political consumerism as an independent
   variable, and its role influencing and igniting other forms of political
   behavior. This study theoretically argues that politically motivated
   consumerism will incite people to generally seek to persuade others of
   political issues. Using causal order tests and Random Intercept
   Cross-lagged Panel Structural Equation Models from a two-wave panel
   survey from the United States, the study shows robust empirical evidence
   that this is the case.},

Abstract = {Climate change has been on the national agenda since the late 1970s, yet
   until recently, little progress had been made at the federal level
   because of the dominance of the fossil fuel industry within the policy
   subsystem. In this article, we use multiple streams approach with
   process tracing methods to examine why significant climate policy was
   able to pass in 2022, despite growing polarization, when previous
   attempts had all failed. We examine two key case studies, the failure of
   Waxman-Markey in 2010 and the success of the Inflation Reduction Act in
   2022. In 2010 some climate organizations were hesitant about cap and
   trade as a policy mechanism to address climate change and failed to
   stimulate advocacy in their grassroots. Since then, climate groups
   rallied around an alternative policy approach, which involves investing
   in clean technology inspired by the Green New Deal. Activists built
   significant power within the Democratic Party, evident in climate policy
   remaining prominent on the policy agenda at the beginning of Biden's
   presidency. Moreover, media outlets have improved their coverage of
   extreme weather events by tying them to climate change. In short, the
   political dynamics changed with growing grassroots climate advocacy,
   motivating citizens to elect Democratic leaders capable of passing
   climate legislation and keeping climate high on the policy agenda.},

Abstract = {The article examines the enduring relevance of Edward Said's
   perspectives on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, juxtaposing
   contemporary challenges with Said's visionary advocacy for a one-state
   solution. The analysis delves into the complexities of the evolving
   Middle East dynamics, emphasising the need to reconsider alternative
   frameworks. Central to our analysis is Said's intellectual ethos, which
   champions the role of secular intellectuals and profoundly influences
   his democratic values, his defence of a binational state, and his
   staunch support for academic freedom. Said's legacy serves as a guiding
   beacon, stressing the moral imperative to challenge entrenched power
   structures and advocate for truth. The article explores Said's arguments
   for a binational state rooted in democratic principles and universal
   values, arguing that despite scepticism and political marginalisation,
   his vision offers a compelling pathway toward reconciliation and peace,
   transcending conventional paradigms and amplifying marginalised voices.
   This approach highlights how Said's commitment to democracy and
   intellectual freedom shapes his support for causes other believe to be
   hopeless and continues to inspire contemporary discourse.},

   development. The design and impact of such structures, collectively
   referred to as national women's machineries (NWMs), has, however, varied
   across contexts. This paper advocates analysis of the actors and factors
   that impact the design, influence, and function of NWMs, with an
   emphasis on the role of state gender ideology. It argues that NWMs, as
   formal state institutions, are never conceptualized and formed in a
   vacuum, with various competing interests impacting their design and
   function especially in non-democratic and unrepresentative contexts.
   Through a case study of NWMs in the Islamic Republic of Iran, it shows
   that despite efforts for cabinet-level women's rights policy-making
   since the early 1990s, throughout the past decades such gains have faced
   backlash and reversal as a result of conservative ideological shifts, at
   times rendering such institutions illegitimate in the eyes of the
   Iranian feminist movement.},

Abstract = {In September 2020, the Czech digital audience was confronted with a
   request to critically revise local history and the current official
   cultural and political attitudes from a decolonial perspective. A group
   of university students and lecturers published the Manifesto for
   Decolonization, a digitally circulated text that sparked a debate about
   what was/is the position of the former Czech lands and contemporary
   Czechia within the history of Western European colonization. This
   article examines three phases of the event: the publishing of the text,
   its digital audience reception, and the reflection of its production. As
   for publishing and reception, the imaginations inscribed into the text
   by its authors are examined in comparison with the imaginations present
   in the popular responses of digital audiences expressed on social media.
   To explore the context of production, we conducted and analyzed
   interviews with three local experts involved in the production process.
   Through our findings, we demonstrate the following: (1) the role of a
   generational gap that divides the views of local experts in interpreting
   the aspirations of the Manifesto and (2) the role of a polarized nature
   of online deliberation that drives the dismissive popular response and
   leads to the formation of an anti-discourse. We conclude that two
   symptoms-victimization of the Self and weaponization of Leftist
   labels-are especially salient in the response to the decolonization
   agenda in Czechia as a Central Eastern European, post-socialist country.},

Abstract = {Are corruption trials that involve the highest ranks in the public
   sphere and large private companies biased against some groups? Existing
   research predominantly focuses on corruption prosecutions of
   politicians, leaving unresolved the extent to which judges apply
   differential treatment when convicting and sentencing the political
   class compared to other defendants, including those in the private
   sector. To address this gap, we investigate judicial bias within
   Brazil's famous ``Opera \& ccedil;\& atilde;o Lava Jato,{''} the largest
   corruption investigation carried out in history. Leveraging an original
   database that traces the trajectory of the universe of the 3154 cases of
   Lava Jato, we show that judges' sentencing decisions were not governed
   by a partisan logic. Instead, judges were more inclined to impose longer
   prison times and higher fines to elected politicians when compared to
   all other defendants, particularly those from the private sector. We
   interpret these findings as evidence of antipolitical class bias.},

Abstract = {Relational and emotional practices intensive in emotional labor play an
   essential role for high-level decision making, even though this labor is
   often devalued or unseen. United States presidents can often present
   themselves as rational and emotionally detached because they delegate
   emotional work to other members of their team. The burden of such work
   is unequally distributed along gender and racial lines. It involves
   expressing empathic concern, repairing relations, anticipating others'
   emotional responses, protecting marginalized colleagues, speaking hard
   truths, and providing emotional support to help others regulate their
   emotions. This article contributes to research on emotions in decision
   making, public administration, and presidency studies. Case studies of
   Nancy Reagan and Valerie Jarrett-who played important roles in the
   Reagan and Obama administrations, respectively-illustrate the article's
   main argument.},

Abstract = {This research note presents three lessons, drawn from the case of
   Jordan, for studying GEMs in autocratic countries. I discuss three
   interrelated points: (1) the relationship between state feminist
   institutions and ``autocratic genderwashing{''} (Bjarneg \& aring;rd and
   Petterberg 2022); (2) the connections between GEMs and independent
   feminist movements; and (3) the enduring/emerging salience of
   ``traditional family values{''} as an obstacle for gender equality
   pursuits. I argue that, while GEMs in autocratic contexts can advance
   gender equality measures, they are constrained by state power and
   interests. Moreover, rather than enhancing democratic performance, GEMs
   in illiberal states can become part of the autocratic playbook for
   sidestepping democratic reform. As such, the global research agenda on
   GEMs should include rigorous empirical analyses of how GEMs, democrats,
   and women's rights activists work with (or against) authoritarian
   regimes, as well as analyses of how gender equality efforts might enable
   the entrenchment of autocratic power.},

Abstract = {A large body of research investigates whether democracies' decisions to
   intervene militarily are guided by external threats and strategic
   considerations or whether domestic factors play the predominant role.
   Foreign military intervention can create a ``rally-round-the-flag{''}
   effect and might be used to divert attention away from domestic
   problems. A reassessment of diversionary theory for France, as one of
   the most militarily active European powers, which has hardly been
   subject to rigorous empirical research so far, is not supportive of the
   theory's theses. There is only weak support that France is more likely
   to intervene in months with low presidential popularity and no evidence
   of a systematic rally effect after France gets involved in military
   disputes. With few exceptions, presidential approval ratings do not
   improve.},

Abstract = {Liberalism offers communities an eclectic set of core values and diverse
   institutions that may improve the chances that people with varying
   beliefs and life goals can live and work together in relative peace and
   prosperity. Yet liberal democracy is under threat, once again.
   Anti-liberal populists on the right and radicals on the left both
   dismiss core civil and political rights, but for different reasons:
   unrealistic expectations for moral consensus or equality of outcomes,
   respectively. Similarly, too many self-described liberals act
   illiberally, allowing their enthusiasm for a particular cause to justify
   sacrificing other core values. This essay has three purposes: (1) to
   counter recurring forecasts of the death of liberalism; (2) to clarify
   that liberalism's normative, political, and institutional diversity has
   proven essential to its survival thus far; and (3) to suggest ways in
   which liberalism's diversity may be further enriched by incorporating
   polycentric governance and other aspects of institutional analysis as
   developed by Elinor and Vincent Ostrom.},

Abstract = {Democracy, as collective self-government by citizens, rests on citizens'
   capacity to bargain in good faith with those whose interests are not
   their own. Fair bargains that ensure adequate security and welfare rest
   on an implicit agreement: Each citizen recognizes that sectional
   interests (including our conceptions of ideal justice) will never be
   fully realized, but they are better off inside the bargain than outside
   of it, and will bargain again another day. Striking and revising civic
   bargains depend on the education of citizens: In aggregate, the
   citizenry must develop the requisite civic skills, political knowledge,
   and capacity for judgment.},

Abstract = {The article presents a revisionist interpretation of the reforms in the
   late Soviet Union, focusing on the strong affinities between the
   perestroika and China's reform and opening-up. The article draws on
   social constructivism, poststructuralism, and post-Marxism and
   formulates an original typology of Soviet political discourses as the
   main method. Discourse analysis reveals that the implementation of the
   Chinese reform model in the Soviet Union was possible in discursive
   terms. Politico-economic analysis shows that the reform of Soviet
   socialism, which began in 1983 before Gorbachev's perestroika, coincided
   largely with the parallel process in China. The author argues that the
   neo-Leninist perestroika was modelled on Dengism until the hegemony of
   this discourse was replaced by liberal socialism in 1988. Nevertheless,
   neo-Leninism remained relevant up to August 1991 when the failure of the
   State Committee on the State of Emergency frustrated the prospects for
   socialism in the country. The article concludes that the dismissal of
   Dengism by Soviet leaders was one of the principal causes of the
   collapse of the Soviet Union. This historical experience provides the
   Communist Party of China with invaluable lessons and shows the crucial
   importance of the Four Cardinal Principles for reform and opening-up.},

   the purposes being generate a structural change that would contribute to
   greater efficiency of the mexican productive system. This article
   reviews certain evidence of this structural change in the mexican
   productive system through an input-output analysis in the period
   1980-2018. The results show that the structural change, measured by the
   participation of the sectors in the added value, has not been
   significant, it is observed that at the end of the analyzed period the
   productive system has a greater presence sectors with great carrying
   capacity and dispersion.},

Abstract = {Terrorism and counterterrorism are often described as ``ironic{''}, but
   conceptual engagement with irony has been very limited. Building on the
   lifework of cultural anthropologist Joseba Zulaika, this article
   considers irony as an analytical meta-perspective in the critical study
   of (counter)terrorism. It draws on the life and work of German-American
   Christian ethicist Reinhold Niebuhr (1892-1971) to argue that the
   ironies of (counter)terrorism under U.S. president Barack Obama, who
   admired Niebuhr, point to an unconscious failure of collective
   self-understanding. Dissolving these ironies requires new narratives of
   American identity that cut across foreign and domestic politics, state
   and non-state actors, the ``war on terror{''} and white supremacy in a
   long view of history. Facilitating this multidirectional process of
   self-reflection and -transcendence is a key task for critical scholars
   of (counter)terrorism.},

   Issue Involvement and Congruence with the Sponsor Influence Their
   Responses and Decisions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 28},
Abstract = {This study investigates how voters derive pleasure and meaning from
   political advertisements by conducting a 3 (sponsorship) x 2 (issue)
   factorial experiment. It examines the impact of the interaction of issue
   involvement and congruence between sponsorship and voters' party
   affiliation on enjoyment and appreciation of the advertisement. Voters'
   real-time emotions (determined by their facial expression) and their
   attention to the screen (captured via eye-tracking sensor) were
   measured. Voters' responses to advertisement were examined in
   association with their subsequent candidate preference. Advertisements
   by congruent sponsors are enjoyed and appreciated more than those by
   incongruent sponsors. Negative and mixed emotions and time spent on the
   screen are more pronounced among those with higher issue involvement
   when viewing congruent advertisements. Only enjoyment, appreciation, and
   expression of positive emotions during advertisement exposure are
   positively associated with voting decision.},

Abstract = {This article aims to increase the knowledge of the roles and functions
   of public health institutes (PHIs) by exploring and comparing the
   Scandinavian PHIs, their roots, and developments over time. The research
   questions are the following: What was the history behind these public
   institutions? How have they changed over time? Have they followed
   divergent or parallel paths of change? How, if at all, have they been
   influenced by public sector reforms? Comparing the three Scandinavian
   countries based on an institutionalist approach, the article seeks to
   increase the understanding of the role of PHIs in governing public
   health. The article is based on documents from parliaments and
   governments from the public health institutes, supplemented by
   institution narratives and relevant public health and public
   administration literature. The Scandinavian PHIs have common roots from
   the early 1900s, have followed different routes, and have different
   institutional characteristics and different roles as public health
   institutions. However, after more than 100 years, the Scandinavian PHIs
   belong to the international PHI organization. They are responsible for
   knowledge dissemination, surveillance, and preparedness for the handling
   of epidemics and pandemics. The article argues for more comparative
   research on institutions related to public health authorities, such as
   the PHIs.},

   Scandals in Latin America},

Abstract = {Voters often perceive female politicians to be less corrupt than male
   politicians, and recent work posits that political parties use this
   perception to their advantage by running more female candidates when
   corruption is salient. However, few studies have tested if voters
   actually respond more positively to women in corrupt contexts as
   theorized. Using a preregistered survey experiment fielded in Mexico,
   Guatemala, Uruguay, and Chile, I test if mayoral female candidates are
   preferred by voters after a corruption scandal. In all four cases, a
   corruption scandal lowers respondents' likelihood of voting for a new
   candidate from the scandalized incumbent party regardless of the
   candidate's gender, but only Guatemalan respondents have a significantly
   higher vote likelihood for a female candidate post-scandal. In Mexico,
   Uruguay, and Chile, there is no difference in vote likelihood across
   candidate gender after a corruption scandal. These findings shed
   important light on how voters' perceptions about the connection between
   women and corruption can be context-dependent. When parties run more
   female candidates after corruption scandals, the strategy may not always
   be successful at maintaining voter support.},

Abstract = {The Indonesian government's attention to economic infrastructure
   development has increased over the last two decades. However, there has
   been a trend of rampant rent-seeking in infrastructure projects by
   elites in both local and central governments. Nonetheless, why and how
   rent-seeking practices in infrastructure projects have been so endemic
   in Indonesian local government remains poorly understood. This article
   addresses this by investigating how infrastructure development in local
   government serves dual functions of economic growth and political
   commodity by utilising qualitative data obtained from interviews in
   Central Kalimantan (2016) and East Nusa Tenggara (2020) provinces. This
   data confirms the existence of infrastructure's dual function, in which
   official regional development planning documents and accompanying
   regulations are more likely to function as a legal umbrella for
   legalising rent-seeking practices. The term `unjust by default'
   identifies the practice of rent-seeking by formalising
   political-economic interests into regional development planning
   documents and manipulating regulations in order to implement
   infrastructure development programmes.},

Abstract = {While causal inference has become front and center in empirical
   political science, we know little about how to analyze causality with
   latent outcomes, such as political values, beliefs, and attitudes. In
   this article, we develop a framework for defining, identifying, and
   estimating the causal effect of an observed treatment on a latent
   outcome, which we call the latent treatment effect (LTE). We describe a
   set of assumptions that allow us to identify the LTE and propose a
   hierarchical item response model to estimate it. We highlight an often
   overlooked exclusion restriction assumption, which states that treatment
   status should not affect the observed indicators other than through the
   latent outcome. A simulation study shows that the hierarchical approach
   offers unbiased estimates of the LTE under the identification and
   modeling assumptions, whereas conventional two-step approaches are
   biased. We illustrate our proposed methodology using data from two
   published experimental studies.},

Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},

Volume = {95},
Number = {3},
Pages = {523-534},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The recent political difficulties faced by the Scottish National Party
   have made the prospect of a future Scottish independence referendum less
   salient in both Westminster and Holyrood. However, whilst the short-term
   prospects for the independence movement look challenging, the long-term
   question of Scotland's future within the UK remains an important area of
   analysis for constitutional policy makers and scholars alike. This
   article seeks to add to the debate on the future of the UK's territorial
   constitution by arguing for the passage of a `Scottish Clarity Act' by
   the UK government, which would outline the rules about when and how a
   future Scottish independence referendum should be conducted. Using the
   Canadian Clarity Act 2000 as an international example of the
   constitutionalising of secession, it argues that there are numerous
   benefits associated with providing greater clarity on Scotland's
   constitutional future, including the dampening of polarisation, the
   mitigation of constitutional crisis, the improvement of governance and
   the bolstering of democracy in the UK.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the role that cultural diplomacy has played as a
   tool of nation-building for sub-state public entities led by movements
   representing stateless nations. It exemplifies this with the case of
   Catalonia's search for recognition in Germany, 1901-1939. The analysis
   highlights the ambivalence that characterized the actions of the Catalan
   sub-state public entities, between resigning themselves to their status
   as regional actors and aspirations for a different political
   constitution. We argue that this ambivalence was a strategy to maximize
   the effectiveness of their cultural diplomacy policies considering state
   and international contexts reluctant to recognize sub-state entities as
   political actors.},

Abstract = {This Afterword to the special issue on `Aesthetic Citizenship, Beauty
   Politics, and the State' seeks to conceptualise further some key themes
   raised by its authors. The editors (Kukuczka and Liebelt, this volume)
   forward an understanding of citizenship as a complex aesthetic formation
   that combines embodiment practices, affective solidarities, and state
   power as a form of (neoliberal) governmentality that citizens
   internalise. In exploring the significance of aesthetic citizenship, I
   utilise Mbembe's idea of necropolitics to understand aesthetic labour,
   affective solidarity, and biopower from the embodied perspectives of
   marginal citizens and noncitizens discussed in these articles.},

Title = {Tracing Shifting Host Country Problematization(s) of Transnational
   Repression: The Evolution of Swedish Efforts to Counter ``Refugee
   Espionage{''}},

Abstract = {Not least since the brutal killing of Saudi journalist and regime-critic
   Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul in late 2018 has the
   question of transnational repression emerged on the agendas of human
   rights activists, policy makers, and scholars of migration and
   authoritarianism. Such practices are commonly conceptualized as a dyadic
   interaction between repressor and repressed. However, on closer
   inspection, the dyad is, in fact, a triad. Relatively few studies
   account for or explore the context in which such acts of transnational
   repression occur: the countries of residence in which targets and
   victims reside. Taking inspiration from the problematization framework,
   this article deepens our understanding of the complex and multifaceted
   ways in which Sweden, a country often lauded for its comprehensive
   approach and response to transnational repression, has constructed
   ``refugee espionage{''} as a challenge not only for law enforcement and
   intelligence agencies but also, Swedish bilateral relations and
   sovereignty. Through an in-depth analysis of 21 annual reports published
   by the Swedish Security Service (S \& Auml;PO), the article shows how
   the conceptualization and problematization of the issue has - often in
   response to particular incidents - become both broader and wider over
   time.},

Abstract = {Resistance to political change is a hallmark of Sri Lankan politics
   since the 1980s. Thus, the polity has been able to sturdily maintain the
   status quo. Linking contemporary politics with the political legacies of
   the 1980s, the article argues that by providing continuity to the 1978
   constitution, Sri Lanka's political system has become a hostage to the
   status quo. This is shown in the analysis of the functioning of
   democracy, and ethnic conflict and peace-making. The rise of illiberal
   democracy is traced to the present constitution and the centralizing
   tendencies of the J.R. Jayewardene regime. While some successive
   power-crazed leaders have nurtured illiberalism, others have undertaken
   a limited constitutional reform. Yet, none of them have rejected
   illiberalism altogether and shown commitment to a liberal constitutional
   order. Likewise, the debate on political solution is centred on the 13th
   Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution. Both the government and
   opposition leaders have a shared interest in failing every peace
   initiative and denying a permanent political solution. Together they
   form a barrier to comprehensive political reform in the country.},

Abstract = {Africa is the epicenter of conflict in the world. Seven of the 12
   current United Nations peacekeeping operations are in Africa, and 80\%
   of its peacekeepers are deployed on the continent. Nigeria is one of the
   largest troops contributing countries to the UN. This article
   interrogates Nigeria's peacekeeping role in Africa and its voting
   pattern at the Council. Founded on unstructured interviews, it offers
   deep insight into Nigeria's leadership role in conflict resolution and
   peacekeeping during the 2010/2011 and 2014/2015 tenures. Nigeria has
   declined in influence and is unable to provide the robust conflict
   resolution that Africa needs.},

Abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies spread worldwide,
   international discussions have increasingly focused on their
   consequences for democracy, human rights, fundamental freedoms,
   security, and economic and social development. In this context, UNESCO's
   Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, adopted in
   November 2021, has emerged as the first global normative framework for
   AI development and deployment. The intense negotiations of every detail
   of the document brought forth numerous controversies among UNESCO member
   states. Drawing on a unique set of primary sources, including written
   positions and recorded deliberations, this article explains the
   achievement of global compromise on AI regulation despite the
   multiplicity of UNESCO member-state positions representing a variety of
   liberal and sovereignist preferences. Building upon Boltanski's
   pragmatic sociology, it conceptualizes the practice of multilateral
   negotiations and attributes the multilateral fragile agreements to two
   embedded therein compromises: Structural normative hybridity and
   situated normative ambiguity allowed to accomplish a compromise by
   linking macro-normative structures with situated debates of multilateral
   negotiations.},

Abstract = {Why are democratic publics reluctant to use force against fellow
   democracies? We hypothesize that the democratic peace in public opinion
   owes, in large part, to racialized assumptions about democracy. Rather
   than regime type per se doing the causal work, the term ``democracy{''}
   inadvertently primes the presumption that target countries are
   predominantly white. This implicit racialization, in turn, explains the
   reluctance of the American public to support aggression against fellow
   democracies, most notably among respondents higher in ethnocentrism who
   disproportionately drive the democratic peace treatment effect. Two
   original survey experiments, a large-scale word embedding analysis of
   English texts, and reanalyses of published studies support this
   expectation. Our results suggest that the democratic peace in public
   opinion is, largely, an ethnocentric and racialized peace. The findings
   hold implications for the role of racism and racialization in foreign
   policy opinion research generally.},

Abstract = {Moving students out of the classroom and into the community provides
   promising outcomes for teaching residential racial segregation and
   understanding of historical context of preservation. This class provides
   an exploratory case study of students in political science and art
   studio who worked in teams to develop digital stories for an
   historically black neighborhood in a large urban city. Through
   examination of archival data, conducting interviews, and experiencing
   places within the neighborhood, students gained insight into the
   politics that work to promote some history over others. Students became
   more aware of the importance of neighborhoods and gained an
   understanding of the importance of history to the lives of people living
   in particular communities. Students learned to work as a team, to
   overcome challenges of working in a community, and gained an
   understanding of political processes that work to hide or bury
   significant history of marginalized groups and neighborhoods.},

Abstract = {The relationship between terrorism and human rights has attracted
   considerable research and policy attention. As countries grapple with
   formulating effective strategies to combat terrorist groups, governments
   have faced criticism for resorting to increased repression in the name
   of counterterrorism. One common response by states to terrorism has been
   the implementation of counterterrorism legislation, with numerous
   countries enacting such laws in the aftermath of the September 11
   attacks to establish a legal framework for addressing the terrorist
   threat. In this paper, we delve into the impact of counterterrorism
   legislation on abuses by the state, with a specific focus on the use of
   torture and political imprisonment. We argue that the introduction of
   counterterrorism legislation has exposed more citizens to the threat of
   being detained and the risk of torture by state forces. We contend that
   this relationship is particularly pronounced in countries adopting new
   counterterrorism legislation after 9/11. To substantiate our argument,
   we utilise data on counterterrorism legislation and conduct empirical
   testing, uncovering some supportive evidence for the relationship
   between the introduction of counterterrorism legislation and the
   prevalence of torture and political imprisonment, especially in cases
   where new laws were introduced in the aftermath of the September 11
   attacks.},

Abstract = {The paper contributes to the debate of the Swedish welfare state by
   re-examining the view of freedom underlying the design of this welfare
   model. The point of departure is two interpretations by Bo Rothstein and
   Henrik Berggren and Lars Tr \& auml;g \& aring;rdh, which both describe
   advancement of individual autonomy as the ultimate point of the model.
   The paper argues that these readings are overly liberal in the sense
   that they exaggerate the importance of individualism and autonomy. The
   view of freedom that shaped the Swedish welfare state was not liberal,
   and individual autonomy was not the overriding goal for the founders of
   the model. Instead, the view is best described as quasi-republican and
   nondomination based. It was mostly a result of semi-Marxist ideas about
   capitalist power and exploitation that lingered on in the ideology of
   the Swedish social democratic party, the SAP, in the 1930s and 1940s.
   During the first decades of the 1900s, the SAP gradually revised these
   ideas in a domination-based direction. It was the outcome of this
   process that more than anything else gave the impetus to the design of
   the Swedish welfare state.},

Abstract = {Through analysis of archival research and in-depth interviews this
   article traces the development of the social expectation in the United
   States for perfected smiles, produced through orthodontic treatment, and
   discusses its implication for two dimensions of citizenship: rights and
   sense of belonging. Belonging is facilitated by normative embodiment. In
   the contemporary United States, an irregular smile is a mark of
   alterity, indicating poverty, parental neglect, or foreign birth.
   Decades of health care policy shaped by neoliberal ideology that limited
   the supply of medical personnel, thwarted efforts to develop universally
   available state-subsidized medical care and supported private medical
   insurance as the primary solution to medical need, contributed to the
   establishment of a dental system oriented toward the production of
   profit. Profit-oriented dentistry made the perfect smile emblematic of
   the American middle class and intensified the social and economic
   exclusion of people with irregular smiles.},

Abstract = {Focusing on young Bamileke women in Yaound \& eacute;, Cameroon, in this
   article I examine how they prepare and perform for the Women's Day
   parade. I suggest that their preparations and performances are permeated
   by an aesthetic of glamour that is underpinned by affects of pleasure
   and joy. This aesthetics was incorporated into state parades at the
   independence of the Cameroonian state. Thus, when affects are evoked in
   young women's performances on Women's Day, the young women make Cameroon
   look good. I argue that, for young women, the everyday aesthetic acts
   involved in crafting an aesthetics of glamour in preparing for and
   performing at the parade become affective ways of self-constitution as
   Cameroonian citizens. Young women who are invited to participate and
   conjure up glamour can also claim certain benefits associated with the
   state, thereby revealing glamour as a gendered aspect of the affective
   politics of belonging in Cameroon.},

Abstract = {Understanding white Americans' attitudes toward Black Americans is
   crucial in US public opinion. However, survey measurement of these
   attitudes is hampered by social desirability bias, low discriminant
   validity, and the potential for heightened demand characteristics and
   backlash. I propose a new measure: music genre preference. Consistent
   preference for genres historically and popularly linked to white culture
   over those linked to Black culture may partly reflect white Americans'
   attitudes toward Black Americans. Using four online surveys comparing
   the performance of racial resentment, stereotype measures, and genre
   preference on social desirability, predictive and discriminant validity,
   and research awareness, I find that genre preference either outperforms
   or matches the established measures on these criteria. Genre preference
   thus provides a viable alternative for measuring white Americans'
   attitudes toward Black Americans, and potentially other group attitudes
   in both the United States and other cultures. This also provides an
   example of sensitive question design using proxies that elicit attitudes
   without discomforting the survey taker or alerting them to the purpose
   of the study.},

Abstract = {This article provides a systematic overview of what Italians think of
   the war in Ukraine, relying on an analysis of the polls conducted over
   the first 17 months of the conflict. Italians are worried about the war
   but the issue is not a priority. Most Italians blame Russia, but they do
   so to a lesser extent than do other Europeans and the assigned
   responsibility is affected by the question wording. Only a minority
   favours arms shipments to Ukraine. Survey data record a higher level of
   support for imposing sanctions than for sending weapons, but also a
   slight decline in support for sanctions over the period. Since Italians
   do not expect either side to win the war, they foresee that it will end
   with sacrifices on the part of Ukraine.},

   Chile and Bolivia},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {89},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Can protests produce changes in electoral behavior? In this paper, we
   examine variations in voter turnout and electoral preferences at the
   local level after a protest cycle. Using data on protest occurrence
   during the 2019 social mobilizations in Chile and Bolivia and a
   difference-in-differences design, we assess the impact that street
   demonstrations had on voting behavior in the elections that took place
   the following year. We found that turnout was higher in municipalities
   that had protests, while the incumbent vote was lower. We argue that the
   effect on turnout is explained by the surge in political efficacy that
   emerged from the protests. Furthermore, we suggest that the protests
   enabled more effective blame attribution and heightened the salience of
   political issues, leading to changes in voter preferences. These results
   demonstrate the effect of protests on electoral dynamics, highlighting
   their role not only in mobilizing voters but also in shaping electoral
   preferences.},

Abstract = {Narratives of racialized sexual violence-specifically, where a
   dominant-group woman faces harm by a man outside the dominant group-have
   long been a staple of American political communication. Past scholarship
   has examined how these threats prime racial resentment among White
   Americans; less is known about their gendered effects. I present an
   original survey experiment comparing racialized sexual threats with
   racialized threats that are not gendered or sexual. Both evoke racial
   resentment. Compared with solely racial threats, however, racialized
   sexual threats also make benevolent sexism salient for a range of
   democratic outcomes. Moreover, I find distinct effects by respondent
   race and gender, as men and women of different racial identities are
   situated differently vis a vis racialized sexual threats. To demonstrate
   that the gendered/sexualized impact of these appeals extends to
   real-world campaigns, I conclude with an analysis of candidate support
   in the 1988 presidential election. The 1988 race saw one of the most
   notorious examples of racialized sexual threat in modern American
   politics in the ``Willie Horton{''} ad, aired on behalf of the Bush
   campaign. Even with the limited measures available in that year, I find
   that sexism played an important role in shaping Americans' political
   views.},

Abstract = {Research on lawmaking generally examines why lawmakers enact certain
   policy ideas. However, most ideas in the United States Congress never
   become law. Eventually, members stop introducing them altogether. This
   process, where policies are proposed, not acted on, and no longer
   advocated for is, by far, the most common legislative outcome. The
   literature pays it little attention. Yet, how ideas die is important in
   understanding why some measures stop being realistic alternatives, the
   importance of policy entrepreneurship, and how policy windows affect the
   supply of ideas. This paper analyzes why congressional ideas die. I
   argue and find that the proposals designed to be enacted, especially by
   legislators with more issue expertise and agenda-setting powers, are
   less likely to persist across terms. I also show that ideas disappear
   more often when their sponsors leave Congress, but do not find a similar
   pattern for when policy windows close and lawmaking conditions worsen.},

Abstract = {The PD has always been a composite and complex party, where different
   and sometimes opposing political cultures converge. The 2023 primary
   elections overturned the predictions by handing over the party
   leadership to Elly Schlein, interpreted by many as the beginning of a
   renewal process. However, it is precisely the logic of open primaries
   that brings into play different actors, bearers of values and strategies
   that are not always congruent. Will the PD be able to build a more
   homogeneous political culture and a coalition capable of facing the
   centre-right in the upcoming internal challenges? Does the change in the
   PD's internal balances complicate or facilitate the formation of a
   competitive political offer? To answer these questions, we will
   investigate the differences between members, sympathisers and delegates
   to the National Assembly according to three analytical dimensions -
   self-placement on the left-right axis, value positioning with respect to
   some relevant issues, and the party's coalitional perspectives - on the
   basis of the data collected during the 26 February 2023 primaries and in
   the context of the National Assembly on 12 March. First, we will deal
   with the process of selecting the PD leadership, discussing the rules of
   competition, the specificities of the two main candidates, and
   reconstructing the results obtained at the regional level during the
   phase of the democratic militants' vote and that of the open primaries.
   The analysis of the data will provide us with solid elements on which we
   can then offer an overall discussion of the main results that emerged to
   understand, in terms of ideological orientations, values, and
   expectations on the party's coalitional strategies, whether and to what
   extent Schlein's election might be the prelude to an internal renewal or
   whether it might prefigure a new season of divisions.},

Abstract = {This paper offers a methodologically innovative two-stage approach for
   studying divisions amongst parliamentary representatives. Using the
   Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) as our case study, we construct a
   dataset of all Labour MPs elected in the 2019 general election, along
   with their nominations in the 2020 Labour Party leadership and deputy
   leadership elections and their membership of, or affiliation with,
   various party-aligned organisations. We then conduct a cluster analysis
   based on this dataset, which reveals the existence of a two-cluster
   model-comprised of the Mainstream (N = 162) and the Left (N = 33)-and a
   five-cluster model-in which the Left exists alongside the Tribune Soft
   Left, the Labour Friends of Palestine and the Middle East Soft Left, the
   Unaligned Centrists, and the Right. Finally, we test the robustness of
   our clusters via a canonical correspondence analysis of the language
   used by MPs on social media (Twitter/X) and their contributions to
   parliamentary debates (Hansard). We show that the MPs from different
   clusters do use different languages to one another in both fora. We also
   find that the main divide within the PLP is between the left of the
   party and the rest of the party, and that the deputy leader, Angela
   Rayner, has a broader base of support amongst the PLP than its current
   leader Keir Starmer.},

Abstract = {Can firms extract policy concessions by hiring former members of
   Congress (MCs)? I argue that firms use personnel with a background in
   politics to keep regulators away. With an empirical focus on tax
   enforcement, I present comprehensive evidence that firms can use MCs to
   avoid regulatory enforcement. Hiring MCs decreases firm-level tax
   rates-highly connected MCs who served on committees responsible for tax
   policy produce the largest decrease. Leveraging a novel hand-coded
   dataset of tax audits, I show that hiring an MC is associated with a
   lower probability of being audited. The change in enforcement has
   important consequences: hiring an MC is associated with smaller fines
   and with uncertain tax positions being automatically accepted due to
   lapses in the statute of limitations. This indicates that rules are
   enforced differently against politically connected firms, shedding new
   light on the role of connections in the American political economy.},

Title = {Do Partisanship and Policy Agreement Make Citizens Tolerate Undemocratic
   Behavior?},

Abstract = {Do voters tolerate undemocratic behavior by politicians with whom they
   share partisanship or policy preferences? I answer this question
   employing conjoint experiments in the United States, the United Kingdom,
   the Czech Republic, Mexico, and South Korea. Theoretically, I
   distinguish between a hypothesis based on social psychological partisan
   attachments and Downsian hypotheses based on spatial policy preferences.
   In all five countries, I find that partisanship does not suppress the
   negative effects of undemocratic behavior on voting intentions, whereas
   policy agreement between voters and candidates even increases punishment
   of undemocratic behavior. However, partisanship has much stronger direct
   influences on voting intentions than policy agreement and especially
   undemocratic behavior. The findings suggest that voters have a harder
   time setting aside their partisan attachments than their policy
   preferences for democracy. But most importantly, citizens are not
   completely blinded by either partisanship or policy agreement when
   facing undemocratic politicians.},

Abstract = {Wikipedia-based assignments have been adopted successfully in classrooms
   to improve learning outcomes. However, although this teaching method has
   been adopted regularly in Western higher education settings, more is
   needed in an international learning environment. Therefore, this
   research investigates how employing technology-mediated
   student-generated Wikipedia content can enhance learning outcomes in an
   international setting. This study adopted Wikipedia's online
   user-generated content platform to create student-generated content in
   introductory Public Administration classes. We conducted quantitative
   and qualitative analyses to assess whether a Wikipedia writing
   assignment increased learning outcomes. Through pre-and post-surveys,
   students reported increased awareness of their English writing ability,
   knowledge of Wikipedia content writing, and knowledge of Wikipedia
   content writing. The study recommends adopting Wikipedia for
   introductory courses, especially relevant for courses taught in an
   international environment where English is the language of tuition.
   Nonetheless, instructors should act as active facilitators in group
   work, aid students in finding and shaping project topics, and narrow the
   project scope to ensure that it remains educational within the taught
   context. Furthermore, it is recommended to have a reasonable project
   length, design cross-group interactions, and include peer review and
   technical support in designing the project.},

Abstract = {While vaccine hesitancy has become a salient issue, few studies have
   examined the influence of international collaboration and vaccine
   developments on people's attitudes towards vaccines. The international
   collaboration especially with China has been an integral part of the
   field of influenza. In recent years, attitudes towards vaccines and
   China are both heavily politicized in the USA with a deepening partisan
   divide. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to be vaccine
   hesitant, and they are also more likely to view China negatively. At the
   same time, the USA has economic, security, and medical collaboration
   with Japan and most Americans display a very positive view of the
   country. Thus, does a more international collaboration or more
   country-specific vaccine development have an influence on US vaccine
   hesitancy? This study conducts a survey-embedded question-wording
   experiment to assess the roles of US-China and US-Japan collaboration
   and partisanship in people's willingness to get the flu vaccine. Despite
   the previously successful and effective US-China collaboration, this
   study finds that respondents especially Republicans are much less likely
   to receive a US-China flu vaccine than a US-Japan or USA alone.
   Interestingly, both Democrats and Republicans are as willing to receive
   a US-Japan vaccine as USA alone. These results point to critical roles
   of partisanship and international relations.},

Abstract = {This work explores China's African public relations and image-building
   effort, focusing on Nigeria. Thus, the paper's purpose is twofold:
   first, to investigate whether China's conduct of public diplomacy
   through its soft power resource-development assistance-has effectively
   shaped positive Nigerian public perception of China, and second, to
   determine the media's role in advancing China's public diplomacy in
   Nigeria. Specifically, it explores the interaction of economic
   development assistance, media, and public relations. I do this by
   comparing China's foreign direct investment (FDI) in Nigeria (2010-2019)
   with the public's perception of the FDI's influence on the Nigerian
   economy (2016 and 2020) and the media's role in shaping public support
   toward the investments. Utilizing a range of datasets, I find that
   Chinese economic investment alone is insufficient to substantially shape
   positive Nigerian public perception of China. Within a framework of
   mediated public diplomacy, I demonstrate that the Chinese image-building
   effort in Nigeria would likely enhance when the country links economic
   investments with public relations to make the investments more visible
   through effective media representation.},

Abstract = {Political engagement is vital to the functioning of democratic systems,
   yet a significant portion of the population remains disengaged from
   conventional political activities as voting. These individuals often
   lack the opportunities and motivation to cultivate their reasoning
   abilities for understanding politics. This study explores the potential
   of deliberative minipublics to foster the development of reasoning
   skills among those excluded from the political discourse. By focusing on
   individuals with low levels of political engagement, the study
   investigates three minipublics on the topic of climate change in
   Switzerland. Utilizing the Deliberative Reason Index, the analysis
   uncovers how dialogue-driven engagement can enhance political
   understanding and involvement. The results demonstrate the potential of
   deliberative practices to bridge the gap between the politically
   disengaged and the complex world of political participation, offering
   fresh insights into citizens' capabilities to deliberate on intricate
   issues.},

Abstract = {Many theorists argue that justice in international migration requires
   states to maximize the openness of their borders, even when that can
   only be done by denying full political membership to some migrants. In
   contrast, this article contends that democratic ideals recommend
   inclusion as the guiding principle of migration policy, since full
   membership for all the state's residents is the only way to preserve
   democratic self-rule, whereas the justice- and freedom-related goals
   associated with openness can be promoted via other means. I define full
   inclusion as involving not only formal rights, but also solidarity.
   Against accounts that define solidarity in terms of shared identity
   (i.e., a specific commonality), I argue that democratic solidarity
   requires intersubjective ``identification{''} among members of the
   demos, oriented toward their shared future. This account suggests how
   migration policy might advance the practical goal of more open borders,
   along with other moral goals associated with calls for greater openness,
   without sacrificing important democratic ideals.},

Abstract = {When can we expect multiple racial groups to find common ground in the
   face of potentially unequal distributive urban policies? While we
   understand a great deal about the role of elites in inter-ethnic
   coalition building, we know less about the conditions under which
   cooperative behavior among their co-ethnic voters is more likely.
   Research has found that multiracial coalitions are critical to the
   political incorporation of racial/ethnic minority group interests at the
   local level but conflict between minority groups persists due to both
   real and perceived competition for resources. In this paper, we argue
   that elite co-ethnic endorsements can increase co-ethnic voters' support
   for urban distributive policies that disproportionately benefit
   outgroups over one's own ingroup. We test our theory using a survey
   experiment from a representative sample of more than 1800 Los Angeles
   County voters. We find that respondents are less likely to support
   policy proposals that exclusively target benefits toward ethnic
   outgroups compared to when their ethnic ingroup exclusively benefits
   from an identical proposal. But we also find that the presence of
   co-ethnic endorsements can increase support for proposals that benefit
   an ethnic outgroup. We find this effect among Black, Latino, and Asian
   Americans in our sample.},

Abstract = {This article uses the lens of liminality to explore the consequences and
   wider implications of the war in Ukraine for those states
   ``in-between,{''} with a specific focus on Georgia and Moldova and their
   relations with the EU. It examines the different approaches that these
   two states have adopted in response to their spatial and temporal
   liminal condition: Georgia has focused on the discursive construction of
   a new identity, while Moldova has tended to focus on the process of
   becoming European, on the institutional elements of integration with the
   EU. War is also a liminal condition, an uncertain and transformative
   period; thus, the war in Ukraine adds a further layer of liminality to
   the EU's eastern neighborhood, intensifying the ambiguity and
   contestation that can occur as Georgia and Moldova pursue recognition
   and acceptance of their European identity.},

Abstract = {Children who grow up in families who are affiliated with violent
   extremism and terrorism are frequently viewed through a
   security-oriented lens which focuses on their risk of radicalisation, or
   the security risk they may pose to society. This security-oriented
   approach limits a broader understanding of the multiple ways in which a
   child's life may be impacted when an immediate family member is involved
   in terrorism. To rectify this, this paper highlights the utility of
   Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory (EST) to systematically
   identify how this familial affiliation may impact the child's life in
   diverse ways that extend beyond security-oriented outcomes. We
   demonstrate that EST is particularly useful because it allows us to
   systematically and holistically understand how the life of the child is
   impacted by familial association with a terrorist group in multiple
   spheres of their life (family, education, peer groups, etc.). We apply
   this approach to an example of a family who travelled to Syria in 2015
   to join ISIS. This article demonstrates the utility of EST for
   researchers and practitioners to better understand the impact of
   familial involvement in terrorist groups on children moving away from
   more security-oriented approaches.},

Abstract = {Iraq's 2017 victory over the Islamic State (IS) ushered in a period of
   political gridlock and electoral violence. Rather than demilitarising to
   compete in elections, pro-government militias retained their weapons
   while simultaneously providing public goods and services. Iraq's
   experience presents a challenge to existing theories of civil war
   transitions, which suggest that wartime coalitions either fragment or
   demilitarise as peacetime approaches. Iraq's stalled transition presents
   a third possible outcome-a stalled transition-which emerges from
   constraints confronting pro-government coalitions. Iraq's ecosystem of
   `militia-party hybrids' resembles Lebanon, Libya, Syria, and Yemen,
   where armed groups enter peacetime politics without fully
   demilitarising.},

Abstract = {U.S.-China competition has been widely viewed as the most important
   feature of world politics that will shape the emerging international
   order. Whereas Washington increasingly sees Beijing as the sole great
   power with the intent and capabilities to dismantle the U.S.-led liberal
   order, Beijing views Washington's military buildup and new partnerships
   in the Indo-Pacific region as the latest U.S. attempt to contain and
   encircle China. This paper adopts a power transition perspective to
   compare the advantages and disadvantages of both powers, using six
   parameters to measure their relative national strength. In doing so, the
   authors try to update and modernize A.F.K. Organski's theory in the 21st
   century, applying it to the most consequential relationship of our time.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the perception and the reaction of Turkish
   people to Israel's war in Gaza. For this purpose, we utilized a survey
   involving 1,393 respondents. First, we documented that there is
   widespread support for Palestinians from both sides of the political
   spectrum, Second, 94 percent of people do not believe that Israel's
   public statements about protecting civilians are true. Third, an
   overwhelming percentage of people also joined the economic boycott by
   not buying Israeli products. Although young voters are less likely to
   support the Palestinian cause, this relationship disappears once voting
   preferences are taken into account. This implies that voting preferences
   matter for understanding the support for Palestinian cause. Compared to
   those who do not vote or vote for parties with a small base, AK Party
   and MHP voters are relatively more likely to support and CHP and HDP
   voters are relatively less likely to support the Palestinian cause.
   Overall, these results show that there is a strong pro-Palestine
   sentiment in T \& uuml;rkiye, and companies that have business ties with
   Israel are going to be hurt economically by the ongoing war due to
   consumer boycotts.},

Abstract = {Of the myriad cues voters rely on to evaluate political candidates, only
   one cue is available to all voters in all candidate-based elections -
   the candidates' names. Drawing upon multiple decades of election data in
   local and congressional elections in the United States, I examine the
   relationship between the processing fluency (pronounceability and
   commonality) of political candidates' names and vote share. I observe a
   strong, positive relationship for name pronounceability and more
   ambiguous results for name commonality. A onestandard deviation increase
   in pronounceability is associated with an increased vote share of 0.8
   percentage points in congressional general elections, 1.4 percentage
   points in congressional primary elections, and 0.29 percentage points in
   local elections. Despite some sensitivity to how fluency is
   conceptualized, these findings suggest that the phonological
   characteristics of candidates' names are consequential heuristics that
   voters use to evaluate candidates. Future research should seek to unpack
   the causal processes underlying these results by disentangling the
   racial and ethnic cues embedded in names.},

Abstract = {The high saliency of immigration presented social democratic parties
   with a strategic quandary on reconciling different values and
   expectations. Danish Social Democratic Party (S) stood out as it shifted
   to restrictive policies while achieving intra-party cohesion and
   avoiding major internal strifes. This article investigates the factors
   behind S' immigration shift and intra-party cohesion, focusing on a
   timeframe between 2005 and 2019 by combining an analysis of S'
   immigration policies with insights from 12 interviews with party elites.
   Comparing varying strategies, ideological inclinations, and support, I
   explore the intra-party actors' perceptions, constraining and permissive
   influences of intra-party dynamics, development and reconstruction of
   new ideological frameworks and factional alignment. Findings highlight
   the importance of intra-party dynamics on shifting policies in
   immigration for social democratic parties, providing further insights on
   how the S party elite navigated the policy shift while ensuring
   intra-party cohesion from electoral, ideological and organisational
   perspectives.},

   legislature with bill text reuse},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Pages = {1252-1271},

Abstract = {Recent work challenging the ``rubber stamp{''} view of authoritarian
   legislatures demonstrate that they are important arenas for
   policymaking. Yet their amending function remains understudied. To what
   extent is draft legislation modified in authoritarian parliaments? Why
   are some bills amended more than others? This article addresses these
   questions in the Chinese case, using a dataset covering 167 bills
   adopted by the National People's Congress or its Standing Committee from
   2008 to 2022. I assess the degree of bill change by comparing bill
   content before and after parliamentary treatment with a text reuse
   method. Results show a moderately high level of amendment activity, with
   noticeable variations across bills. I argue that the amending role of
   the Chinese legislature serves a crucial mechanism for integrating and
   coordinating bureaucratic interests. I find that bills are modified to a
   greater extent if more ministerial and provincial stakeholders are
   involved within the legislative arena. This article provides systemic
   evidence supporting the power-sharing theory: legislative institutions
   compensate for the executive-level deficiencies and help manage
   intra-elite relations in policymaking. It does not confirm the influence
   of public opinion, casting doubt on the bottom-up account of bill
   change.},

Abstract = {Digitally networked and new, unconventional activities allow citizens to
   participate politically in activities that are low in the effort and
   risks they bear. At the same time, low-effort types of participation are
   more loosely connected to democratic political systems, thereby
   challenging established modes of political decision-making. This can set
   in motion two competing dynamics: While some citizens move closer to the
   political system in their activities (upstream effects), others engage
   in political activities more distant from it (downstream effects). This
   study investigates non-electoral participation trajectories and tests
   intra-individual change in political participation types over time,
   exploring whether such dynamics depend on citizens' exposure to
   political information. Utilizing a three-wave panel survey (n = 3490)
   and random intercept cross-lagged panel models with SEM, we find more
   evidence for downstream effects but detect overall diverse participation
   trajectories over time and a potentially crucial role of elections for
   non-electoral participation trajectories.},

Abstract = {Politicians and parties employ nationalist symbols to attract public
   support in elections worldwide. Robust evidence indicates that the
   public perceives women politicians as more liberal than men politicians.
   The association between politicians' gender and perceived ideology,
   combined with the close relationship between nationalism and radical
   right parties, prompts the question: how do individuals evaluate women
   politicians when they use nationalist cues? To answer this question, we
   field a survey experiment in Serbia, a country with a long history of
   nationalist movements and a digraphic language with one of the alphabets
   associated with nationalism. Exploiting the Cyrillic alphabet and its
   association with nationalism, we find that respondents perceive women
   politicians who use Cyrillic as nationalist as much as men using the
   same symbol. However, these women are perceived as more nationalist than
   women and men politicians who do not employ Cyrillic. We then show that
   women and men respondents utilize these cues differently, indicating
   that the gender of nationalist politicians and members of the public may
   affect politician evaluations.},

Title = {A three-legged race: assessing the functionality of consociational
   power-sharing with cabinet conflict-resolution data from Belgium

Abstract = {Consociational democracy is a well-known recipe for managing divided
   societies, but critics have questioned the functionality of the
   power-sharing it prescribes. When different segments are forced to
   cooperate in a context of vetoes, elite cooperation and joint
   decision-making might be hard to achieve. But what does decision-making
   in power-sharing arrangements look like in practice? This study sheds
   light on the real-life functionality of consociational power-sharing as
   measured through the outcomes of conflicts (N = 328) in fifteen
   power-sharing cabinets in Belgium (1979-2006). Specifically, it
   assessess (1) how politicians (fail to) resolve conflicts, (2) how this
   evolved against the background of decentralization, and (3) whether
   ethno-territorial conflict-resolution is harder than
   non-ethno-territorial conflict-resolution. Different dimensions of
   functionality are discerned. The results provide a counterintuitive but
   nuanced view on power-sharing functionality, showing (1) that
   dysfunctionality levels vary depending on the indicator, (2) that
   power-sharing is not increasingly dysfunctional throughout time, and (3)
   that ethno-territorial conflict-resolution is not harder. The analyses
   add to contemporary debates on coalition politics, the paradox of
   federalism, and ethno-territorial politics.},

Title = {When does attachment to natural resources count?},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 1},
Abstract = {This paper proposes an original account, based on the capabilities
   approach, that explains which kinds of attachment to natural resources
   are sufficiently morally weighty to give rise to special resource
   rights. The paper provides a critique of current attachment theories,
   which fail to provide a clear way to differentiate between what is a
   preference and what is a legitimate attachment, and thereby justify
   overreaching resource rights. It then examines Armstrong's welfarist
   account of natural resources justice, and argues that the capabilities
   approach can be used to specify the relevant dimensions of well-being,
   as elements of human flourishing. A capabilities-based account is
   appealing because it is more limited in scope than existing attachment
   theories, and able to make finer distinctions regarding the scope and
   content of individuals' rights claims. Attachment claims are legitimate

   Educational policy documents and guidelines from international agencies

   parliamentary commissions. Data from legislatures in Latin America are
   analyzed and three interactive factors with gender are tested: ideology,
   previous parliamentary experience, and participation in the government

   despite having conquered important spaces of representation, women still
   face disadvantages and occupy subordinate positions within this

Abstract = {Mainstream European left-wing parties have seen their traditional class
   base evolve in postindustrial economies. In response, these parties have
   adjusted their platforms to adopt policies that aim to secure positions
   for workers in a more volatile labor market through education and
   training. But how does the electoral appeal of this ``social
   investment{''} paradigm compare to that of the older welfare paradigm
   that passively distributes benefits to the poor and inactive? Using
   cross-country data from two surveys, I find that the policy preferences
   of industrial workers respond differently to labor market precarity than
   do those of service sector workers, particularly sociocultural
   professionals. Further, industrial workers who prefer traditional
   welfare policies are less likely to vote for the center-left than
   professionals, even if those professionals hold similar policy
   priorities. These results help explain the center-left's recent
   electoral trends while also highlighting current limitations on building
   cross-class political coalitions in postindustrial economies.},

Abstract = {This article examines how public opinion-notably political activism and
   protest, as well as threats of violence, and violence itself-shaped the
   eventual resolution of the 1876 election. While not discounting the
   bargaining or machinations of party elites in forging an ultimate
   compromise, the standard explanation in the scholarly literature, the
   emphasis here adds important texture and nuance to the conversation, and
   strongly suggests that public opinion (broadly construed) played a
   significant, if not exclusive, role in pressuring party leaders to
   compromise on the eventual Electoral Commission Act that resolved the
   crisis. In particular, a series of January 1877 demonstrations held
   across several key states, coupled with the threat of ``menace{''} at
   the heart of the Southern rifle clubs that were prominent in the
   campaign and its aftermath, provided strong incentives to partisan
   leaders and especially members of Congress to seek compromise to resolve
   the electoral crisis. The article also addresses the contested nature of
   mass meetings and protests in this era-and in general-and how partisans
   seek to define terms and behaviors to suit their political positions.},

   the crosshairs of the gunsight, childhood as a proxy of non-combatant
   status is at times dismissed or even repudiated, thereby inscribing
   particular children as combatants, qua soldiers. The Uruzgan strike and
   the tactical decision-making that unfolded in the lead-up to it
   recommend thinking beyond the `usual suspects' in the making of child
   soldiers.},

Abstract = {The rise of movement parties in Europe has disrupted traditional notions
   of party politics, introducing new avenues for citizen engagement and
   political mobilisation. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of
   the electorate of movement parties, using nationally representative
   survey data from six European countries. We identify four types of
   movement parties: green/left-libertarian, far-right, eclectic, and
   centrist, and examine the distinct profiles of their voters. The only
   common characteristic we find across movement party supporters is their
   belief in the influence of protests. We argue that
   green/left-libertarian voters embody a generational gap in political
   participation, as they utilise both electoral and non-electoral
   engagement to express their post-industrial demands. Far-right voters
   are distinguished by their discontent with the democratic system and
   political elites, following the pattern of what others have referred to
   as `protest voters'. Meanwhile, centrist and eclectic voters embody the
   profile of `critical citizens', who support the democratic system but
   are dissatisfied with its current functioning. While we see movement
   parties as a genuine innovation in the internal structuring of party
   organisations, our study calls into question the utility of this concept
   when seeking to understand the behaviour of their electorate. We
   emphasise the importance of recognising the diverse motivations behind
   movement party support, enriching our understanding of the changing
   dynamics of party politics in Europe.},

Title = {The empowerment effect of visible political representation: Examining
   the impact of Muslim representation on political outcomes},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {87},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Previous studies have found an `empowerment effect' of minority
   representation, but often face a difficult methodological obstacle: any
   observed correlation between visible political leadership by
   marginalized groups and political engagement of its members may be due
   to reverse causation or unaccounted-for confounders. We use a novel
   video -vignette design and conduct two pre -registered survey
   experiments to test if visible political leadership of Muslims affects
   American Muslims' and non -Muslims' political engagement. In both
   studies, Muslim and non -Muslim respondents randomized into the
   inclusive treatment judged the political system to be more fair and
   legitimate. Treated Muslim participants also showed slightly more
   positive attitudes towards prospective political participation and
   political candidacy. These findings suggest that the visible
   representation of underrepresented groups can have outcomes beneficial

Title = {The imbalanced effect of politicization: How EU politicization favours
   Eurosceptic parties},

Abstract = {This article investigates how the systemic politicization of the EU is
   associated with support for different political parties. We argue that,
   while politicization involves actions by both Eurosceptic and Europhile
   parties, it does not affect parties at both extremes of the continuum in
   the same way. To investigate these differentiated effects, we leverage
   data from the European Elections Study and the Chapel Hill expert survey
   covering two decades (1999 to 2019). The evidence supports the
   hypothesis that, when it comes to voters' preferences, politicization
   strongly favours Eurosceptic parties. We conclude that the systemic
   politicization of European issues is thus a one-way street leading to
   the reinforcement of the constraining dissensus on the EU.},

Abstract = {Political scientists recently have taken great strides in addressing
   sexual harassment and assault in the discipline. Little has been said,
   however, about sexual violence that political scientists may confront
   during field research. Field research involves any data-collection
   activity that occurs away from a researcher's home institution,
   including visiting a prominent archive, interviewing political elites,
   and conducting direct observation of political phenomenon, and fieldwork
   is widely considered essential to data collection and career development
   across political science subfields. Field researchers may experience
   numerous power disparities that put them at acute risk for sexual or
   gender-based violence in the field, and evidence suggests that such
   experiences are pervasive and professionally devastating. In an effort
   to reduce gender-based violence and discrimination across academic
   worksites, several disciplines and institutions have developed specific
   guidelines and protocols to prevent and address sexual harassment and
   assault during fieldwork (Berkeley PATH to Care Center 2020; University
   of California, Riverside 2018; University of Toronto, Department of
   Anthropology 2019; Woodgate et al. 2018). Political scientists, however,
   have largely failed to conceptualize field placements as work settings
   or to address gender-based violence during fieldwork in our curriculum,
   training, and policies. Instead, they rely on deeply held methodological
   fallacies that insist on a field researcher's absolute privilege,
   trivialize experiences of sexual violence, and weaponize rape myths to
   portray survivors as professionally incompetent (Hunt 2022).},

Abstract = {Constructing narratives of memory has long been acknowledged as a major
   component of nationalism and nation building. In Israel the memory of
   the Holocaust is widely seen as constituting one of these major
   components and is at the core of Israeli national identity. Since the
   early 2000s, the imminent passing of Holocaust survivors has resulted in
   an intense preoccupation with the question of the future of this memory.
   This preoccupation has produced new commemorative initiatives engaging
   with interactive digital platforms. In our article we explore the role
   of human agency in successfully conjuring up alternative or forgotten
   memories that dramatically transform contemporary remembrance landscapes
   by analyzing two recent commemorative projects in Israel, Zikaron
   Besalon and Eva's story. Informed by the understanding of the centrality
   of temporal orientations to the dynamics of social interaction in our
   analysis we adopt a temporal framework.},

Abstract = {Most of the literature examining forum-based social interactions
   considers arguing and bargaining as the main modes of communication used
   by negotiating parties, and authors have often claimed that arguing
   interactions can be distinguished from bargaining ones on the basis of
   the presence/absence of some validation mechanisms. Starting from this
   assumption, authors have tried to study real-world international
   negotiations and to distinguish arguing from bargaining empirically.
   These attempts, however, have encountered several paralyzing
   methodological hindrances. This paper claims that the current
   differentiation between arguing and bargaining is built on erroneous
   assumptions and on a certain degree of undertheorization of bargaining
   types of forum interaction. The position advanced in this paper is that
   both arguing and bargaining types of interaction rely on similar
   validation mechanisms. Furthermore, the study shows that this erroneous
   distinction is the reason why authors have hitherto been unable to
   isolate and distinguish arguing from bargaining while looking at
   real-world international negotiations. The final goal of this paper is
   to challenge the current definitions of arguing and bargaining, and to
   provide the first step of a long-term research project aiming at the
   reconceptualization of these two types of interaction.},

Abstract = {Do parties face an electoral penalty when they nominate candidates of

   legislative election data from 2018, 2019, and 2020 to isolate the
   effect of nominating a candidate of colour on a party's general election
   performance. Utilising this approach with real-world data heightens
   external validity relative to existing racial penalty studies, largely
   supported by surveys and experiments. We find no evidence that
   candidates of colour are disadvantaged in state legislative general
   elections relative to narrowly nominated white candidates from the same
   party. These findings challenge the leading explanations for the
   underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minority groups, with implications
   for candidate selection across the United States.},

Abstract = {As a claimant state to the South China Sea, Vietnam is known to be
   decisive in safeguarding its maritime territorial claims. In order to be
   consistent with its echoed rules-based order in the South China Sea and
   its defense policy of non-alignment, this study argues that Vietnam's
   responses vis-\& agrave;-vis China's assertiveness at sea have been
   through the employment of divergent maritime diplomatic strategies of
   retaliation and deference vis-\& agrave;-vis China. This study
   concludes; Vietnam primarily employs civilian maritime hard power assets
   to showcase its active presence at sea to secure recognition of its
   contemporary maritime capabilities; Vietnam engages in limited-coercive
   maritime diplomacy through its maritime constabulary forces to indicate
   Vietnam's decisiveness in its maritime claims; and Vietnam's
   co-operative maritime diplomacy is through the conduct of joint
   exercises and training, and goodwill visits, with its strategic partners
   in Southeast Asia and broader Indo-Pacific region. It concludes that
   Vietnam is treading with caution with the US to deter producing signals
   of engaging closer with the US, which can cause elevated tensions at
   sea. This explanatory empirical research utilizes data from AMTI and
   relevant secondary sources between 2010-2022 and adopts the theoretical
   framework of Le Miere's tripartite typology of maritime diplomacy.},

Abstract = {Modernization is the process of transformation and development from
   traditional agricultural society to modern industrial society and
   information society. A necessary path and inevitable choice for human
   society in its development to an advanced stage, modernization
   represents the direction of progress and driving force of development
   for human civilization. At once a reflection and critique, a dialectical
   sublation, and an overall transcendence of traditional society,
   modernization is led by an advanced class that embodies the contemporary
   spirit. For its promotion, modernization relies principally on the three
   levers of science and technology, capital, and the market, and as its
   goal, it posits the realization of industrialization, urbanization, and
   informatization. Led by the Communist Party of China (CPC), the Chinese
   path to modernization is socialist in its essence, and possesses not
   only the common properties of modernization, but also Chinese
   characteristics based on China's particular national conditions.
   Specifically, this path embodies the people-centered concept of
   modernization, is committed to achieving all-round human development and
   social progress, surpasses the object-centered model of Western
   modernization guided by the logic of capital, and provides a new choice
   and development direction for humanity in achieving modernization.},

   (Post-)Politics?},
Journal = {POLITOLOGIJA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {115},
Number = {3},
Pages = {77-108},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on different concepts of sensus communis and their
   relationship with the conditions of political reality. An attempt is
   made to show that Gadamer's and Arendt's political conception of sensus
   communis is too dependent on political conditions and the homogeneity
   and unity of the community, and thus cannot exist under post-political
   conditions. The paper seeks to defend Immanuel Kant's aesthetic
   conception of sensus communis, demonstrating that the disinterested
   judgment of beauty exists regardless of political circumstances. Based
   on this, the paper reviews practices existing in post-politics that
   attempt to use the aesthetic understanding of sensus communis for the
   purposes of political unity. It also draws attention to the
   understanding of sensus communis in different contexts, arguing that the
   concept and its interpretation often become obscured across various
   contexts.},

Abstract = {Even though global justice does not require open borders in principle,
   it imposes significant constraints on how states can exercise their
   right to exclude in practice. First, rich states have the primary
   obligation to assist the poor in their home countries, and only a
   secondary obligation to host those who cannot be assisted where they
   live. Second, the employment of coercion must be proportional to the
   objective pursued, such that only in situations of imminent, direct, and
   serious risk are immigration restrictions justified. Third, whenever it
   is necessary to limit access, this limitation should be partial and
   temporary. States must procure alternative transit routes and restore
   freedom of movement as soon as possible.},

Title = {Parliament as a Workplace: Dilemmas of Vernacularisation and
   Professionalisation},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {In this article, we engage with recent calls to research parliaments as
   gendered workplaces, which build on earlier international discursive
   turn and institutional reform initiatives towards gender-sensitive
   parliaments. Our engagement explores this workplace framing and how well
   it translates across pluralised, global parliamentary paradigms. We
   develop our arguments with a special focus on the Indian parliament as a
   gendered institution. Viewing the parliament as a gendered workplace
   through an intersectional lens, we show how gender dynamics and
   institutional configurations of power are embedded in class, race, and
   caste inequalities but can shift over time through reflexive challenges.
   We organise our discussion through two approaches to studying
   parliaments as workplaces-vernacular and professional-to argue that
   paying attention to these approaches critically can contribute to
   sensitising the workplace debate to a more capacious, theoretically
   nuanced reading of parliaments as more gender-sensitive,
   gender-inclusive, and gender-responsive representative institutions. In
   outlining the case for paying attention to the vernacular critically, we
   ask whether such an understanding can help to effectively bridge local
   and global understandings of parliaments as workplaces and
   institutionalise them. In studying professionalisation, we examine the
   paradox that professionalisation could lead to the depoliticisation of
   parliaments, which might affect the nature of gender-sensitivity that is
   being institutionalised. This analysis thus brings together
   institutional, postcolonial, and intersectional strands of work to think
   anew about gender-equal political practices in representative bodies.},

Title = {Populist Party Responsiveness and Populist Party Voter Satisfaction With
   Democracy in Europe},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Voters of populist parties tend to be dissatisfied with democracy. Some
   scholars attribute this dissatisfaction with how our democracies
   function to poor representation by mainstream parties and a feeling of
   not being heard. We should see this representation improve with the
   success of populist parties. This improved representation should, in
   turn, have a positive impact on populist party voters' satisfaction with
   democracy (SWD). Existing case studies have only looked at the link
   between formal populist party representation in parliament or
   government, and populist party voters' SWD, with mixed findings, the
   most puzzling of which is that populist party voters may even become
   less satisfied with growing formal representation. There is no
   comparative study on populist parties' actual responsiveness to populist
   party voters and the connection to their SWD. Thus, we ask: How well do
   populist parties represent populist party voters, and how does this
   populist party responsiveness influence populist party voters'
   satisfaction with democracy? We define populist party responsiveness as
   issue-based agenda-responsiveness between populist party voters and
   populist parties and investigate the link to SWD using data on 21
   countries from the 2019 European Election Studies. We find that populist
   parties in Europe are not generally more responsive to populist party
   voters than mainstream parties. Populist parties' agenda-responsiveness
   has a positive effect on populist voters' SWD while being in government
   does not increase the positive effect of populist party responsiveness
   on their voters' SWD. They may be disenchanted by how well their parties
   can eventually ``walk the talk.{''}},

Abstract = {This article examines the relevance and limitations of traditional
   electoral prediction models in the field of Political Science. It is
   pointed out that conventional methods based on sociodemographic
   variables are losing accuracy due to misinformation provided by
   respondents and the shift towards politainment. The need to search for
   new approaches incorporating emotion measurement, such as George
   Marcus's affective intelligence theory, supported by psychophysiological
   measurement techniques, is highlighted. Evidence is presented from
   studies that have used electroencephalography (EEG) and heart rate
   variability (HRV) to predict voting behaviour more accurately than
   traditional methods. The creation of a new model combining self -report
   and physiological response is proposed to improve political behaviour
   prediction.},

   Degenerate by Chloé Cruchaudet},
Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {This article is about the dissident body and the body at war in the
   comic Degenerado, by Chlo \& eacute; Cruchaudet, published in Brazil by
   Nemo. The book tells the story of Paul, a deserter soldier in Paris
   during the First World War, who cross-dresses to avoid being identified.
   However, transvestism takes on identity and sexual contours and is not
   just a subterfuge for a life of freedom and freedom from persecution.
   The aim of the study is to investigate how extreme times can reinforce
   or undermine gender performances. The body at war can be at war with
   itself, due to the antagonistic performativities of gender and sexuality
   that it prescribes. Furthermore, times of war can lead to questioning
   the ways in which human beings relate to themselves and to others,
   including their belonging to certain identity categories. This article
   takes an approach based on queer theory, which considers the
   deconstruction of gender as a factor in freeing oneself from imposed
   sociocultural boundaries. From this perspective, we want to understand
   how internal, external and semiotic-territorial wars affect bodies that
   diverge from normativity, such as the protagonist of Degenerado, whose
   story is based on a real life. We seek to understand what sexual and
   identity politics are negotiated in this work on gender dissidence and
   how these deviations are portrayed aesthetically in a narrative that
   relies on intrinsically linked texts and images like comic books.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE CIENCIA POLITICA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The year 2023 in Ecuador was characterized by a political crisis that
   erupted in the midst of escalating criminal violence. While the
   political crisis was eventually sol-ved by means of new elections, the
   security crisis has persisted and even worsened during the first months
   of the presidency of Daniel Noboa. In response, in January 2024, the
   newly elected president proclaimed a state of ``internal armed
   conflict{''} and declared 22 criminal gangs as terrorist groups. Against
   this background, the article reviews recent development in Ecuador as
   well as the corresponding aca-demic scholarship to discuss two
   questions: Why and how has Ecuador - in such a short period of time -
   moved from being among the most peaceful countries in the region to one
   of the most violent ones? Which consequences of this escalating security
   crisis can we already observe for Ecuadorian politics and the democratic
   regime in more general terms? To make sense of Ecuador's shift from a
   relatively peaceful to a violence-ridden country, we identify three
   interrelated sets of causal factors: Ecuador's increasing role in the
   transnational drug business; the recon-figuration of Ecuador's criminal
   groups; and the social and political context in Ecuador.},

Abstract = {This contribution deals with the professional, academic, personal and
   political profile of the first judges of the American Supreme Court and
   the Constitutional Court of Austria, as well as the Constitutional
   Courts of Germany and Italy in the Post -World War II period, and that
   of Spain during the political transition. Despite the differences
   between the historical contexts and systems of constitutional
   jurisdiction, the fact that they were all Courts created at the founding
   moments of a new regime, in which they played a political and cultural
   role, had an impact on the profile of their members. The comparative
   study reveals some common characteristics: they were men with legal
   training, political relations, institutional experience, and often
   involved in the constituent and legislative work prior to the creation
   of the Court.},

Abstract = {A new philosophical discipline called Philosophy of Technology has
   revolutionised philosophical reflection in this century, proposing a
   differentiated response by fulfilling the philosophical task of
   problematising the apparent obviousness experienced at every historical
   moment. And our challenge begins by trying to understand the meaning of
   a word that is by no means obvious: technology . Its indiscriminate use
   by common sense is an obvious fact that can be seen in graphs and
   spreadsheets, but what is meant by this phenomenon and the consequences
   that flow from it still require multiple scientific and social
   scrutinies. This essay aims to present a breviary of the origins of the
   Philosophy of Technology, which is initially constituted as the
   Philosophy of Technique , as explicitly inaugurated in the work of Ernst
   Kapp and refined in the work of Gilbert Simondon. These are two pillars
   in the formation of this new philosophical discipline, taken here as
   references in the 19th and 20th centuries respectively, which aims to
   offer new keys to understanding the current stage of the process of
   artificialization of human life. Based on these two philosophical
   programmes, we will reflect on the foundations and dimensions of t
   echnical experience in the constitution of human nature . This is a
   theme of indisputable relevance and it is explored here with the aim of
   understanding the state of the art of the human-machine interaction .
   This phenomenon challenges us to think about the serious ruptures
   already experienced at an unprecedented speed, demanding new critical
   horizons- theoretical and ethical- in order to face the so-called
   disruptive challenges that already frighten us and many that are yet to
   come.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyse some of the main weaknesses of
   contemporary democracies in terms of political participation, in the
   face of the threat of totalitarianism and populism. Using a qualitative
   methodology of hermeneutic analysis, we return to Hannah Arendt's
   thoughts on the centrality and fragility of politics in her study of
   totalitarianism, defining the true value of politics in the exercise of
   freedom, participation and authentic interaction with other human
   beings, which depends, as we hypothesise, not only on the extent of each
   person's social inclusion in society, but also on personality traits and
   resilience capacities correlated with different degrees of emancipation
   experienced throughout life. We will conclude by reinforcing the value
   of politics as a non-instrumental human activity and, therefore, with an
   end in itself, enabling human beings to exercise public and collective
   freedom by acting with others.},

Abstract = {This article presents the main theoretical concepts and results of a
   detailed bibliographic review that focuses on understanding the
   processes of democratic transition. The different theoretical visions on
   transitional justice are analyzed, focusing on truth commissions (also
   known as human rights commissions) in the transition processes towards
   democracy. The case of Argentina is taken as an example and in
   particular the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons
   (CONADEP) of 1984. The main objective is to introduce the theme for the
   construction of a mapping on the different commissions for human rights
   created in Argentina to subnational level during the first years of
   democracy (1983-1985).},

Abstract = {In this photo essay, we take readers through ecologies of
   de/colonization that we engage with in our creative methodology of
   walking and talking. As academics called upon to do equity, diversity
   and decolonization work in colonial institutions, we reflect on our
   location in lk eta n and W S \& Aacute;NEC lands ({''}Victoria, BC,
   Canada{''}) and the circuits that extend to the Caribbean archipelago of
   our origins and families (Borik \& eacute;n/Puerto Rico and Jamaica). We
   take up the tasks of collectively reflecting on how to care for our
   communities and for each other in an interconnected world amidst
   socio-ecological crisis. Our method that emerged during the pandemic is
   specific to our embodiments ``here{''} as settlers of Caribbean roots
   whose family histories ``there{''} include both complicity with and
   domination by colonization, trans-Atlantic enslavement, and forced
   migration. We are attempting to learn, as we hold the messiness of
   institutions who want straightforward paths to remediate racism,
   colonization, and the like. Our walking and talking follow a meandering
   and re-visiting process prompted by our institutional contexts and
   circumstances, and also by serendipity, surprise and beauty offered
   through non-human elements on our walks. The photos evidence these
   moments and the connections to ``here-there{''} in ecologies of
   de/colonization. We invite readers on our circuitous paths that involve
   deconstructing, and building or affirming, noticing, following literal
   paths and those in scholarly-activist circles. In the creative process
   of drawing relations of the here-there, and attending to serendipity,
   ancestral spirit, and more-than-human agency, we witness and imagine
   worlds otherwise (King et al., 2020). These circuitous roots and routes
   offer possibilities of reckoning, repairing and re-worlding.},

Abstract = {In this article, we reconstruct the attempted reactionary insurrection
   and coup d'\& eacute;tat against democracy in Brazil, which occurred on
   January 8, 2023, and the reaction of the Lula government, based on
   institutionality and centered mainly on the Ministry of Justice and
   Public Security, which has carried out several actions against the coup
   plotters and the arms laws that were one of the main policies of the
   government of Jair Bolsonaro. Lula has a relatively favorable context,
   marked by the majority consensus on the preservation of democracy, with
   the action of the Federal Superior Court (STF), which has been
   repressing the coup plotters, and the Superior Electoral Court (TSE),
   which prohibited Bolsonaro from contesting elections until 2030. But the
   defeat of the Brazilian coup bumps, on the one hand, in the actions of
   the government that are limited to institutionality, while giving up
   deeply disputing the institutions and, on the other hand, in the
   conciliation with economic sectors permeated by extremism. We argue that
   the solution of the problem, that is, the defeat of the extreme right
   demands the dispute of the state and civil society as a whole without
   conciliation.},

Title = {Patriotism and National Symbols in Russian and Ukrainian Elections},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {How do political parties leverage patriotic appeals in their online
   campaigning within the context of autocracies and hybrid regimes? This
   study delves into the digital campaign strategies deployed by political
   parties during the most recent legislative elections in Russia (2021)
   and Ukraine (2019). In light of the armed conflict between Russia
   -backed separatists and Ukrainian forces in the eastern area of Ukraine,
   war -related themes and patriotic rhetoric emerged as pivotal concerns
   for politicians in both countries. The ``rally around the flag{''}
   phenomenon posits that, in times of crisis, citizens often experience an
   intensified sense of national identity and patriotic fervor.
   Consequently, references to patriotism and related topics may evoke
   positive responses and prove instrumental for politicians during
   elections, serving to engage, mobilize, and attract voters. Drawing on a
   manual content analysis of the underlying communication strategies, we
   assessed whether parties' reference to patriotic gestures and symbols or
   their attention to related policy topics (defense, war and military
   conflicts, and foreign policy and international relations) yielded an
   increased level of user engagement. Our findings reveal that references
   to patriotic symbols engendered increased user engagement within the
   Russian context, albeit without significantly affecting the engagement
   of Ukrainian voters. The latter tended to exhibit greater engagement
   with posts addressing defense and foreign policy matters though.
   Interestingly, Russian parties conspicuously avoided war -related
   topics, while Ukrainian voters displayed a propensity to penalize such
   content by generating fewer reactions to it.},

Abstract = {: We examine the structure of the population of the city of S \&
   atilde;o Paulo in the early nineteenth century using digitalized
   household census records from 1804, 1817 and 1829. We examine the major
   socio-economic groups within the population, as well as the color, age,
   sex, marital status and occupations of the heads of households. The size
   of households, encompassing free individuals, slaves, and agregados is
   also studied. Our findings reveal a community dominated by a minority
   white elite with a majority non-white population. Its economy included a
   major textile artisanal industry with a significant participation of
   free persons of color, and contained a slave labor system typical of
   contemporary urban centers in Brazil.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {4},
Pages = {135-145},
Abstract = {. The article aims to identify and examine the key trends and
   socio-political processes that are shaping the formation of a digital
   elite in the public-power sphere. It demonstrates that the
   transformation of system- forming elements of power, leading to the
   formation of new ``power alliances{''}, is largely hidden from social
   control, and the process of institutionalizing the digital elite as a
   stable privileged group is in its early stages. Representatives of this
   group exert managerial influence through such tools as digital
   platforms, new forms of control over various resources, and influence
   over the trajectories of the digital transformation of traditional
   political institutions: in the long term, this will allow them to
   influence both the public agenda and the adoption of socially
   significant decisions. The authors analyze the key trends in the
   development of the digital elite - the formation of new power relations
   and structures, as well as socio-political actors - ``power
   alliances{''}.},

Abstract = {: The present article has as an objective to problematize the
   contractual provisions in conditions and demands of interest on the
   collection of debt from member states, specifically in the case of Rio
   Grande do Sul, to the Union stemming from the constitutional structure
   of Brazilian federalism. It is to be considered that federalism,
   specially in its cooperative form, does not admit the overlap from one
   federated state in relation to other on matters pertaining to the
   accomplishment of state obligations. Therefore, the financial loans from
   the Union to the States must, at most, contain monetary correction,
   being unreasonable the contractual prediction of remuneratory interest
   under penalty of weakening or nullifying the financial-administrative
   autonomy of the federated states. The methodology applied in the
   research was the hypothetical-deductive to frame that the
   norme-principle of the federation in its cooperative form must conduct
   the contractual norms in the financial loans. The resources used in the
   research were that of doctrine, case law and documents.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the left of the political spectrum in the Czech and
   Slovak party systems has undergone significant changes. The main
   anti-establishment party in Czechia, ANO, has shifted its economic
   programme to incorporate more interventionist policies, while the main
   social-democratic party in Slovakia, Smer-SD, has progressively adopted
   more conservative social positions. These trends have coincided with a
   decline in voter support for the Czech Social Democratic Party (\&
   Ccaron;SSD) and Smer-SD in Slovakia, seemingly supporting the
   dealignment theory generally used to explain the decline of centre-left
   parties in Western Europe. Building on these premises, this article
   explores the first two layers of Mair's conceptualisation of a political
   cleavage (social groups and their defining values) to assess the
   potential gains or losses that social democratic parties in the two
   countries might experience if they rebranded to emphasise left-liberal
   stances. This strategy has been observed to have benefited other social
   democratic parties in Western and Central Europe. By clustering value
   survey respondents along left-wing and progressive social values and by
   analysing these clusters' members using logistic regression, the study
   suggests that while shifting to the left may attract new
   socio-demographic groups, adopting liberal left values might, for both
   parties, be electorally harmful in the short term.},

Journal = {DESAFIOS},

Abstract = {This article aims to explain why the Chilean Frente Amplio has not
   managed to consolidate stable links with the main social movements in
   the country despite having emerged in a context of social mobilization.
   Secondly, it aims to contextualize the case of the Frente Amplio in the
   Latin American scenario through paradigmatic cases of parties that have
   managed to develop and maintain links with social organizations. The
   article addresses four possible explanations: the autonomous and
   non-partisan nature of social mobilization, the rapid and costly access
   of the coalition to the institutional apparatus, the consolidation of an
   organizational structure less open to the influence of social
   organizations and, transversally, the disposition adopted by the
   coalition at key moments of its trajectory towards organized civil
   society. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of both
   contextual factors and explanations associated with party agency.},

Abstract = {The Putin regime has created an imperial, statist, and militaristic
   ideology to legitimize its rule, in which the supposed constants of
   ``history{''} and ``geopolitics{''} are integral components. A multitude
   of institutions, organizations, and individual actors readily compete
   for state resources. They spread the official patriotic politics of
   remembrance. Since the beginning of the full-scale war against Ukraine,
   the state has increased its control over the collective memory of its
   citizens. Heroic tales from the past, imperial traditions, and
   historical images from the ``Great Patriotic War{''} are intended to
   justify the unprovoked war against Ukraine. History has become an
   instrument of propaganda. But it is only effective under conditions of
   repression and censorship.},

Abstract = {In this article, we address the topic of climate conspiracy using the
   categories of abstract and concrete used by Marx and other Marxist
   scholars to account for how the reality of social and natural phenomena
   (such as the changing climate) finds itself not only contested and
   denied by minorities and social groups, but also `objectified' by
   attributing to specific actors the role of willing manipulators of the
   phenomenon itself. Taking advantage of climate scepticism and climate
   denialism, conspiracism blames specific actors for making climate a
   weapon to centralise and reinforce the power of governments controlled
   by liberal elites to manage and change the lives of millions of people.
   Conspiracism finds its main reason in the presence of a climate
   Leviathan that constitutes the most abstract form of techno-politics. In
   this perspective, we argue that conspiracism makes use of the hostile
   relationship between an abstract and a concrete vision of the climate,
   an enmity that has to do with the type of capitalist social and economic
   organisation where concrete abstraction prevails, as Marx had already
   indicated in various texts. In this split between the abstract and the
   concrete, and above all in the convergence of scientific abstraction and
   political-economic abstraction, and in the alleged subsumption of the
   real by the abstract, the formation process of conspiracy thinking in
   general, not just climate thinking, can be explained.},

Abstract = {In Russia, over 120 other languages from 11 language families are spoken
   alongside the state language, Russian. However, the majority of these
   languages are endangered or moribund. Even languages spoken by tens of
   thousands of people are being displaced by Russian and other major
   languages. Only a few languages, such as Tatar, Chechen, and Bashkir,
   are stable. With the extinction of each language, humanity loses part of
   its cultural heritage, which is preserved in stories, verses, epics, and
   creation myths that for the most part have been passed down orally.
   Specific ways of talking about the world and human experience are
   disappearing. This current linguistic overview gives an impression of
   the diversity of the Russian world of languages, but also of the
   dimension of the loss.},

Title = {STATE AS VALUE: REPRESENTATION OF THE IMAGE OF THE FUTURE IN SPEECHES OF

Abstract = {The article is devoted to studying the representation of state as value
   in the speeches of the deputies of the State Duma from the viewpoint of
   the image of Russia's future. As a starting point, the authors used the
   pentabasis model, where the image of the future is presented in the form
   of five elements, one of which is the state, interpreted via trust in
   political institutions. The theoretical basis of the study was the
   concept of Stein Rokkan and his followers, according to which the state
   formation involves building socio-cultural boundaries that indicate
   belonging to a political community. The empirical basis was the
   transcripts of speeches of deputies on current socio-economic, political
   and other issues at the plenary sessions of the State Duma of VII-VIII
   convocations. The research was carried out by the method of discourse
   analysis. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that national
   parliamentarians are deeply concerned about the problem of trust.
   Although decisions on the most fundamental issues are made via
   consensus, deputies feel a lack of trust among certain groups of the
   population, which requires them to exert additional efforts to justify
   their initiatives. The topics they most often turn to include welfare
   state, center-regions relations, and economic development. At the same
   time, they rarely directly touch upon the prospects of domestic
   political institutions, as well as the topic of the image of the future
   in general, which may be explained by both a shortage of strategic ideas
   and external restrictions on parliamentary discourse.},

Title = {Political communication on TikTok. An analysis of Marcelo Ebrard's
   account during the presidential nomination race in Mexico},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Political actors have started to include TikTok in their political
   communication strategies. Marcelo Ebrard, former foreign minister of
   Mexico and aspiring presidential candidate in the analysed period, is an
   example. The politician used the social media to promote his
   accomplishments during his term in office and, above all, as a tool to
   boost his candidacy. The personalism inherent to TikTok's uses allowed
   Ebrard to design a communication campaign focused on his image, given
   the lack of express support from his party and the Mexican president.
   The aim of the research is to assess to what extent the alignment with
   TikTok's specific codes leads to a successful political communication
   strategy. For this purpose, a sample was selected from the opening of
   the account in August 2021 to November 2022, a moment within the
   framework of the presidential candidacy race. Multimodal content
   analysis, involving quantitative and qualitative techniques, was used to
   relate engagement to ten variables corresponding to communication
   techniques. Research results show that the growing adjustment to the
   uses and possibilities of TikTok reinforces the emotional attachment of
   users. Humour and the production of exclusive content for the platform
   are key variables explaining this effect.},

   in Poland and Hungary},
Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {In examining Poland and Hungary, we offer a case study of East and
   Central European nations and economies transitioning from liberal
   democracy and free-market principles to what we term an ``illiberal
   market economy{''}. This shift challenges the neoliberal model that
   underpinned the post-1989 transformations in the region. Furthermore,
   the emerging systems in Budapest and Warsaw defy conventional categories
   found in the Varieties of Capitalism literature. While these systems may
   exhibit surface similarities to coordinated market economies, such as
   increased state intervention and government expansion, they diverge
   significantly due to systemic clientelism. Patronal networks enable the
   ruling party to capture of the state, facilitated by the presence of
   weak or dependent institutions. Political monopolization of power
   fosters an environment conducive to rent-seeking and patronage, often
   reaching corruptive extremes, ultimately serving as coordination
   mechanisms within the economic system. Authoritarian politics in both
   Hungary and Poland instrumentalizes institutions to limit the
   free-market space, resulting in an illiberal market economy - a distinct
   form of state capitalism infused with an East and Central European
   character.},

Abstract = {This essay analyses the constitutional thought of Emilio Rabasa in
   relation to federalism. Although Rabasa is known for having been a
   critic of the 1857 constitution and its unicameral federalism, this
   paper casts Rabasa as a defender of a kind of federalism that was
   favorable to the sovereignty of the states, as opposed to the power of
   the central government. Rabasa supported this argument in two ways: on
   the one hand the states should be reorganized to achieve the ideal of
   ``executive governments{''} and on the other the excessive powers of
   intervention of the three branches of the federal government over the
   states had to be curtailed. These two dynamics impeded or hindered,
   according to Rabasa, the necessary political learning that gave life to
   federalism.},

Title = {ANTI-GOVERNMENT EXTREMISM - CONSPIRACY AND DELEGITIMIZATION OF THE STATE},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Anti -government extremism in Germany may represent examples of the
   significant shift and growth of anti -government movements and anti
   -system activism in the past few years. Conspiracies and insurrections
   to overthrow a democratically elected government are certainly not new
   phenomena, but they are uncommon in consolidated Western democracies.
   The paper tries to convey the manifestations of delegitimization
   movements of sovereign citizens with an emphasis on the potential of
   political violence in the context of correlations of conspiracy theories
   and disinformation and radicalization group mobilization.Selected
   sovereign citizen movements are introduced based on their motivations,
   goals, and strategies of resistance to existing government structures..
   The evaluation is done with the help of an analytical model of three
   dimensions of assessing the level of anti -government extremism of
   sovereign movements: 1. delegitimization of the democratic order, 2.
   offensive social action, 3. democratic norms within the sovereign
   movement. Expressions of coercion against public authorities, state
   institutions and courts in the Czech Republic copy the expressions of
   foreign sovereign citizen movements, including the terminology and form
   used. With the development of the anti -systemic scene in recent years,
   frustrations that have been embedded in society for a long time
   crystallized, among other things. Among them for example deep-rooted
   hostility is towards the division of Czechoslovakia among a certain part
   of the population. It appears a lot in the 40/50+ generation, which, by
   the way, is becoming the main driver of the antisystemic discourse.},

Abstract = {Following the dissolution of the USSR, the Russian Federation's search
   for a new strategy to replace the ideology-based politics of the Soviet
   era became a key issue during the post-Soviet period. In the 1990s,
   Russian politics found itself in turmoil as it struggled to devise
   coherent and effective strategies. The focus of this study will be on
   conceptual suggestions, discussions, and the transformation of Russian
   foreign policy at the end of the Cold War. Under the leadership of
   Vladimir Putin, the ascendancy of the Russian civilisation concept has
   played a significant role in shaping contemporary Russian politics.
   Drawing inspiration from the ideas of prominent Russian philosophers
   such as Danilevskii and Leontyev, President Putin has found powerful
   arguments in his works. Through the influence of his philosophies and
   perspectives, Putin has navigated the complexities of Russian politics
   and brought an end to the quest for a new strategy in Russian politics
   in the 21st century. Their insights have solidified the importance of
   the Russian civilisation concept and its integration into the political
   discourse in Russia. As a result, Russia has found a sense of direction
   and purpose rooted in its historical and cultural identity.},

Pages = {38-57},
Abstract = {This article explores the state of strategic theory in relation to the
   African context. It argues that the dichotomy between war in the Global
   South and the Global North, combined with the shift towards critical
   security studies, has hobbled the development of robust strategic
   thinking relevant to war on the African continent. It combines a
   literature review of theories of war, that have sought to either explain
   the occurrence of war or how to fight and end it, with a scoping review
   of African strategic thinking to highlight this gap. It concludes with a
   call for greater African strategic thinking and propositions for what
   African strategy should entail.},

Title = {Young People's Perceptions of Youth Unemployment: Insights From 11
   European Countries},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Youth unemployment has been an issue in European countries for many
   years. However, the attention paid to it by policymakers has varied over
   time, and there are high cross-country variations in both the size of
   the phenomenon, representations of it, and policy interventions. This
   study adds an intra-country component to the country -comparative
   dimension and assesses the factors affecting how young adults perceive
   youth unemployment. From a theoretical perspective, we postulate that
   the perception of youth unemployment as an issue depends on both
   sociotropic and egocentric evaluations. To address these research
   questions, we analyse data from the Cultural Pathways to Economic Self
   -Sufficiency (CUPESSE) dataset, which comprises responses from more than
   20,000 young adults (aged 18-35) from 11 European countries (nine
   European Union member states together with Switzerland and Turkey). The
   empirical analysis is based on multilevel modelling and reveals that the
   problem perception varies both across countries and within them
   following the hypothesised pattern. The findings show that two factors
   are particularly important for explaining young people's perception of
   youth unemployment as a problem: first, whether they experienced their
   parents being unemployed when growing up, and second, whether their
   friends are unemployed.},

   Article 8 has been violated and regarding the association also the 6,

Abstract = {The article considers the reasons for the rise of religious nationalism
   which has been politically coloring the decades long confrontation
   between the Jews and the Palestinians. The naissance of Palestinian
   nationalism and the clash of the two national movements under the
   British mandate warrant a parallel with present-day developments. While
   the religious component has always been present, albeit to varying
   degrees, in the discourse of various nationalist forces (liberal,
   right-wing, socialist), it received a new impetus by the Israeli
   occupation of Arab lands after 1967 war. The war in Gaza has highlighted
   the special role that religious nationalists are currently playing on
   both sides. The rise of religious nationalism, which resulted from the
   absence of a settlement of the Palestinian problem is a major
   destabilizing factor. The military confrontation between Hamas and
   Israel provides additional material for the analysis of religious
   nationalism at the present stage, its role in creating mutually
   exclusive narratives and radical practices, increasingly narrowing the
   possibilities of eventual compromises.},

Abstract = {How does biased political recruitment-and the legislation of gender
   quotas-affect the quality of representation? The article theorizes that
   biased selection implies a higher hurdle for women than for men. As a
   consequence, fewer-but more talented and ambitious-female legislators
   enter office. When quotas are legislated, the bias lingers but takes new
   forms. Uncertain about their initial choice, parties compensate by
   drawing on incumbent women's legislative record to update their beliefs.
   Quota women are thus more accountable. Drawing on a ``before-after{''}
   design with a control group, this study investigates legislators'
   effort, performance, ambition, and reselection to the European
   Parliament (1999-2014). It demonstrates that non-quota women handled
   more high-impact legislation and aimed at longer careers than other
   legislators. When quotas were imposed, the share of women did not
   increase. However, quota women had a higher pay off from performing well
   in office and reacted by increasing their effort.},

Abstract = {This study examines the impact of cooperation between radical right
   parties (RRPs) and non-RRPs on the policy attitudes of non-RRP
   supporters. As RRPs have gained prominence in recent years, particularly
   for their nativist and anti-immigration positions, this research
   investigates whether non-RRP partisans adopt similar views when their
   preferred parties collaborate with RRPs. Drawing on original survey data
   from Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom in 2019, the findings
   reveal a notable association: non-RRP supporters are more likely to
   express stronger nativist attitudes when they perceive their parties as
   having cooperative relationship with RRPs. These results suggest the
   potential for ideological diffusion, where voters adjust their beliefs
   in response to perceived alignment with allied parties. Ultimately, this
   paper seeks to enhance our understanding of how party cooperation
   affects voter attitudes, suggesting that alliances with RRPs may
   normalize exclusionary policies and exacerbate societal divisions.},

Abstract = {How do citizens want to be represented in politics? We investigate
   citizens' multidimensional preferences regarding six conceptions of
   representation that are derived from political theory. Using original
   item batteries and a conjoint experiment, we elicit the relative
   importance of the dimensions and the types of representation people
   prefer on each dimension. Our results from surveys fi elded in the
   United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany show that 1) descriptive
   representation has comparatively limited appeal for citizens at large,
   but is more important for historically marginalized groups; 2) citizens
   do not focus on local politicians when thinking about who represents
   them, but also seek representation from politicians in other districts;
   3) while citizens strongly value substantive representation, they are
   largely indifferent as to whether their representatives are responsive
   to electoral sanctions. Our fi ndings have important implications for
   how political scientists study democratic representation.},

Title = {A Three-Level Approach to Examining the Relationship Between Categorical
   Beacons of Influence and Democracy in Western Europe},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICS CULTURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 20},
Abstract = {Despite the global proliferation of democracy over recent decades, many
   democratic governments are experiencing unprecedented levels of public
   dissatisfaction. This study examines how various beacons of
   grievance-economic dissatisfaction, safety concerns, perceptions of
   corruption, and attitudes toward immigration-influence individuals'
   satisfaction with democratic governance in Western Europe. Utilizing
   nationally representative data from the 2012 European Social Survey and
   indicators from the Global Terrorism Database, we employ a three-level
   hierarchical linear model to simultaneously analyze individual,
   regional, and country-level variables. Our exploratory, non-directional
   hypothesis posits that there is a statistically significant relationship
   between these multilevel factors and individuals' satisfaction with
   democratic governance in the European Union. The findings reveal that
   subjective perceptions play a more significant role than objective
   indicators in shaping satisfaction with democratic governance.
   Specifically, individuals with positive opinions on immigration and
   higher trust in their national parliament exhibit increased satisfaction
   with democratic governance. At the regional level, higher migration
   rates correlate positively with democratic governance satisfaction,
   suggesting a complex interplay between objective conditions and personal
   attitudes. Conversely, while economic concerns at the individual level
   affect satisfaction, objective economic indicators at the country level,
   such as the GINI coefficient, yield unexpected results, indicating
   higher satisfaction in more unequal societies. By integrating these
   diverse grievances within a unified multilevel model, this research
   advances the theoretical understanding of democratic resilience and
   highlights the importance of considering multilevel factors in assessing
   public opinion. The study underscores the need for policymakers to
   address both subjective perceptions and objective conditions to enhance
   satisfaction with democratic governance. It also calls for further
   research into cross-level interactions and additional regional variables
   to deepen the understanding of the dynamics influencing public
   contentment with democratic governance.},

Abstract = {This article presents a theory of policymaking at the federal and state
   levels where individuals locate based on the differences in state
   policies. Individuals have an ideology that represents the strength of
   preferences for redistribution and social policy. States (and
   individuals) separate with one state spending on redistribution and
   attracting individuals with stronger ideology and another that provides
   a public good and attracts individuals with weaker ideology.
   Polarization results, is natural, and originates in the states. States
   have a preponderance of like-minded residents and can be politically
   noncompetitive. The federal government is divided and bargains over
   policy but inaction on social policy results, which devolves social
   policy to the states. Devolvement reinforces the sorting among the
   states and amplifies polarization. Devolvement is welfare-enhancing but
   divisive. Devolvement does not occur on federal spending. Recent Supreme
   Court decisions create opportunities for additional social policy
   devolvement.},

Abstract = {Power transitions among major states have shaped the course of
   cooperation in the history of the international system. We study this
   relationship from a public opinion angle by examining the effect of a
   potential power transition on attitudes towards bilateral trade
   liberalization. Power transitions can spur political and economic
   conflict because the rising power gains greater influence over the
   course of world politics, including trade rules, allowing it to assert
   its national interest and the interests of its citizens. This implies
   that citizens in the rising power are more supportive of bilateral
   economic cooperation than citizens in the declining power. Empirical
   findings from parallel, survey-embedded experiments in China and the
   United States lend support to this conjecture. Great Power competition,
   therefore, interferes with current international economic affairs - an
   aspect that has received less attention in previous research on trade
   politics.},

Abstract = {This article reconsiders the longer-term legacy of David Cameron's
   attempts to `modernize' the Conservative Party. In doing so, we aim to
   make three main contributions to existing scholarship. Firstly, whilst
   Cameron's modernization project is judged to have been a failure by most
   scholars, we show that Conservative leaders post-Cameron have continued
   a process of party adaptation that exhibits striking continuities with
   many of its key elements. Secondly, whilst these developments have
   co-existed alongside a ratcheting up of seemingly `anti-modernizing'
   populist and nationalist rhetoric, we contend that such moves show
   important continuities with Cameron's own attempts to balance
   modernization with gestures towards Thatcherite politics. Thirdly, we
   offer a re-conceptualization of Conservative Party modernization as a
   fluid and contingent aspect of Conservative Party statecraft marked by
   an oscillation between, and sometimes a fusing of, modernizing rhetoric
   with more traditional Tory appeals.},

Abstract = {Unions sponsor electoral candidates around the world, yet little is
   known about the consequences of these arrangements. I study how union
   sponsorship affected the electoral prospect of British parliamentary
   candidates throughout the 20th century. I collect new data on the
   universe of union-sponsored candidates. Employing a
   difference-in-differences design based on within-candidate variation
   induced by the sponsorship institution and its abolishment, I document
   that sponsorship caused a six percentage point increase in candidate
   vote shares. I outline theoretical mechanisms and examine whether
   sponsees improved their electoral fortune because of changes in
   constituencies, opponents, resources, mobilization, or information. The
   evidence supports the constituency and resource mechanisms: Sponsorship
   helped candidates get nominated in attractive constituencies, accounting
   for two-thirds of the effect, and caused an inflow of resources into
   constituency-party organizations. Overall, sponsorship promoted the
   representation of union-friendly candidates in parliament, but it only
   led to moderate shifts in the balance of power between parties.},

Abstract = {Mainstream parties have often shifted from initially portraying new
   competitors as undemocratic pariahs (i.e., a delegitimizing strategy) to
   portraying the same parties later as democratic (i.e., a legitimizing
   strategy). I argue that voters follow mainstream parties' legitimizing
   strategies in their legitimacy evaluations of these parties. I
   investigate this argument with two independent survey experiments and a
   quantitative media content analysis in two countries that differ sharply
   in the nature of party competition-from mainstream parties
   delegitimizing a far-right party (i.e., Germany) to main-stream parties
   legitimizing it (i.e., Sweden). I find strong evidence that (a)
   mainstream parties can effectively legitimize pariah parties in the eyes
   of voters, (b) turning back to delegitimization has little effect, (c)
   legitimization is no less effective in the face of a third party's
   delegitimizing strategy, and (d) legitimization resonates beyond
   co-partisans. The results suggest that mainstream party legitimization
   of pariah parties has far-reaching consequences.},

Abstract = {``Chancellor democracy{''} has for many decades belonged to the most
   prominent and popular labels assigned to the Federal Republic, or the
   political process in Germany for that matter. At the same time, the
   reference to ``chancellor democracy{''} has long turned into an ``empty
   signifier{''}. This comparative essay takes that state of play as a
   starting point for tracing the term and concept's remarkable career, and
   assessing its understudied and problematic implications for the
   political study of executive politics and leadership as well as the
   democratic process in Germany.},

Abstract = {Giving money to candidates is an important but unequal form of political
   voice. Among those Americans worst represented as campaign contributors
   are Black women and Latinas. Although inequalities in income and wealth
   fuel inequalities in campaign contributions, resources are an incomplete
   explanation. This study investigates, for Black women and Latinas,
   whether their views on donations to candidates differ from their views
   on other forms of civic and political engagement. The results, including
   the absence of a shared norm about giving to candidates, illuminate the
   challenges and opportunities of mobilizing a more representative group
   of campaign contributors.},

Abstract = {The article investigates incumbent exit rates of women and men
   parliamentarians in the national chambers and European Parliament
   delegations of eight West European countries after elections. Relying on
   original data, the article uses a multi-level model to analyse the fixed
   effects of gender, type of delegation, and the politico-institutional
   context on incumbent exit rates, while also assessing random effects
   produced at the country level. The study finds that incumbent exit rate
   of men is significantly higher than women's. However, this result is
   significant in the European Parliament, not national legislature
   delegations. Additionally, we find that men are pushed towards the exit
   by gender quotas and proportional electoral systems. Finally, our
   findings show different dynamics with respect to countries and types of
   delegation, thus expanding our understanding of the gendered
   implications of political careers and institutional frameworks across
   different parliamentary contexts in Western Europe.},

Abstract = {Under which conditions, if any, is it morally permissible for states to
   grant non-citizen residents ('denizens') different political,
   socio-economic, and cultural rights than citizens? What, if anything,
   could justify legal rights-differentiations along the lines of
   citizenship? This special issue scrutinizes these politically
   increasingly salient questions from a wide range of perspectives,
   drawing on recent literature in the ethics of migration, citizenship,
   multiculturalism, and refuge, as well as on normative theories of law,
   territory, and settler colonialism. In this introduction to the volume,
   I sketch a conceptual map of the emerging debate on justice for
   denizens, making explicit some underlying theoretical assumptions common
   to each of the three key domains of legal rights-differentiations
   (political, socio-economic, and cultural rights). I distinguish the
   question of what is owed to denizens as a matter of justice, from that
   of what justice permits and requires in respect to denizens generally.
   And I outline four models, implicit in the literature, for theorizing
   the moral rights different types of denizens have and lack - to help
   determine which forms of unequal treatment wrong them. I conclude by
   providing brief summaries of the seven contributing articles,
   pinpointing them on my conceptual map.},

Abstract = {This article identifies three central axes in the contemporary
   constellation of democratic theory and practice: (1) redefining the
   roots of democratic power, or kratos, in response to new challenges to
   popular participation in democracy; (2) the rescaling of the demos given
   the growing dissatisfaction with liberal cosmopolitan approaches to
   global democracy; and (3) the de-parochializat ion of democracy within a
   multipolar world in light of democratic erosion in liberal democracies
   across Europe and the Americas. This article arrives at these axes by
   way of revisiting the relation of the two concepts constituting
   democracy's etymological roots-demos and kratos-in recent work in
   democratic theory. It concludes by urging to move beyond the post-Cold
   War social imaginary by exploring the question ``What demos and kratos
   for the twenty-first century?{''}},

Abstract = {The implementation of special autonomy in Papua Province has raised
   critical challenges, particularly the marginalization of certain groups
   based on ethnicity and religion. This study examines the dynamic role of
   Muslim groups in Papua post-special autonomy implementation, addressing
   gaps in previous research. Using a qualitative descriptive case study
   approach, the findings reveal three key points. First, the political
   engagement of Muslim groups has become more dynamic but remains limited
   compared to Indigenous Papuans (OAP). Second, special autonomy policies,
   while intended to empower OAPs, have narrowed the participation space
   for non-OAP groups, including Muslims. Third, the policies restrict
   opportunities for Muslim Papuans to hold strategic government positions,
   as recruitment prioritizes OAP representation. These findings highlight
   the multidimensional challenges of special autonomy, including social,
   political, and economic inequalities. The study concludes that, while
   special autonomy policies offer opportunities for regional development,
   they also foster tensions and marginalization. To address these issues,
   it recommends adopting more inclusive governance and balanced policies
   that accommodate both OAP and non-OAP groups. By doing so, Papua's
   development can be more equitable and sustainable, fostering harmony
   among its diverse communities.},

Abstract = {The year 2024 marks the 100th anniversary of the establishment of
   diplomatic relations between the Republic of T \& auml;rkiye and Japan.
   The Republic of T \& auml;rkiye and Japan established diplomatic
   relations on August 6, 1924. The legacy of the Ertu \& gbreve;rul
   incident was firmly entrenched between the two countries. On the other
   hand, although there is no conflict between T \& auml;rkiye and Japan
   due to their geographical distance, it is also difficult to foster a
   concrete cooperative relationship. For this reason, the relationship
   between the two countries was often referred to as ``romanticism.{''}
   Furthermore, to take a deeper look at the relationship between T \&
   auml;rkiye and Japan, it is essential to better understand the issues
   that each other faces. This article looks back at the past relationship
   between the two countries, in which it was difficult to see a concrete
   cooperative relationship despite the good relationship, and examines the
   diplomatic constraints and public opinion that Japan faces and what
   areas the two countries will pursue in more concrete ways in the future.
   The study considers whether such cooperation is possible, mainly from
   Japan's perspective.},

Abstract = {This study explores global governance dynamics affecting climate change
   governance in Indonesia, focusing on legal pluralism as a framework for
   integrating state law, customary law and Islamic law. Considering the
   context of legal diversity, this study investigates the emergence of
   models of climate change governance approaches in Indonesia after the
   2015 Paris Agreement, specifically examining the consequences of climate
   change governance on legal mechanisms related to the climate crisis in
   Indonesia. The study then specifically analyzes ocean-based solutions,
   highlighting the importance of a focused concentration on climate change
   governance and legal frameworks in Indonesia. The process of formulating
   regulations in Indonesia is mainly top-down and neglects to consider the
   socio-economic rules of the society. As a result, the role of
   communities at the grassroots level or other social groups is not
   represented. Therefore, the formulation of Indonesia's NDC policy
   documents, especially those related to the forest and land use (FOLU)
   sector, is recommended to increase the inclusiveness of local
   communities, local governments, and non-governmental organizations. The
   current paradigm of legal pluralism has the opportunity to improve
   climate change governance in Indonesia. Climate change policies through
   international law can be integrated into state law, customary law, and
   Islamic law in Indonesia in a harmonious way.},

Abstract = {Amid ongoing debates over integration failures in Europe, this article
   examines an important yet understudied area: public perceptions of
   integration. Previous studies have largely focused on isolated aspects
   of public opinion, especially cultural elements, offering limited
   insights into how citizens define successful integration and perceive
   policy shortcomings. This article expands the scope with a data-driven,
   two-step approach that enables an open exploration of integration
   attitudes, unconstrained by predefined categories. Using open-ended
   responses, it captures citizens' views on what they deem essential for
   successful integration, while latent class analysis is applied to
   identify distinct groups with shared perspectives. Substantively, the
   analysis provides insights into the diverse nature of public opinion on
   integration, challenging oversimplified measures and bringing to light
   previously overlooked patterns. Methodologically, it offers a flexible
   framework for examining public opinion, forming a basis for future
   cross-country comparisons seeking to enhance our understanding of public
   sentiment on integration.},

Abstract = {The illnesses of United States presidents have long been a subject of
   interest to both scholars and the American public. One particular area
   that has generated considerable study is the management of information
   surrounding such illnesses. An extensive literature has developed around
   efforts by the White House to conceal, downplay, or ignore presidential
   maladies. This literature has largely focused on the period from the
   Gilded Age to the present, accepting the widespread view that such
   efforts did not occur until the second half of the nineteenth century.
   This article examines four antebellum episodes in which the American
   public was not fully informed about the health of their leaders: James
   Madison's near-fatal bout of ``bilious fever{''} (1813), the final
   illnesses of William Henry Harrison (1841) and Zachary Taylor (1850),
   and Franklin Pierce's alcohol-induced psychiatric decompensation after
   the death of his son (1853). Rather than a modern-day phenomenon, this
   article argues that such deception is an ingrained and timeworn feature
   of the American political tradition.},

Abstract = {This article delves into the dynamics of power, public ethics, and
   injustice to explain the tolerance towards types of corruption that
   challenge democracy and go far beyond the most discussed illegal
   `Market' aspects. The aim is to explore the patterns of the more
   `Parochial' aspects of reciprocity and kinship and the `Institutional'
   aspects of manipulating the norms and purposes of institutions that
   corruption has. Using the results of two original surveys conducted
   simultaneously (between October 2020 and April 2021), in which citizens
   and politicians in Portugal were asked about eleven potentially corrupt
   behaviours, this study concludes that it is the normalisation of
   parochialism in power relations that has been indirectly promoting the
   maintenance of institutional mechanisms that reinforce exclusion and the
   adoption of unethical behaviours to restore a sense of equality. It is
   argued that the antidote to Tolerance towards Corruption (TtC) consists
   of a formula that includes the constant improvement of the regulation of
   ethics in public life and public policies capable of mitigating the
   injustices associated with deprivation.},

Abstract = {Guenonian Traditionalism, sometimes called Radical Traditionalism or
   Integral Traditionalism, is an important ideological stream within the
   contemporary far-right. It condemns modernity for its spiritual
   emptiness and for the way in which proper authority, which derives from
   the transcendent, has been usurped. This article asks how Traditionalist
   principles have worked in practice, taking the attempt to establish a
   Traditionalist micro-utopia in Bloomington, Indiana in the 1980s. The
   article argues that the Bloomington community's practice corresponded
   with its thought in that it achieved a degree of separation from
   modernity, but that it was less clearly successful in its spiritual
   aims, given issues with distracting ambitions, strife, and sex.},

Title = {Articulating Lynching in India},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICS CULTURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 12},
Abstract = {Lynching became a popular part of the lexicon in India during the last
   decade, and the word is used to communicate incidents where a group of
   people takes justice into their own hands. Considering the violent
   nature of lynching, it became a topic of intense debate. Yet, there is a
   lack of definitional clarity, and the ambit of lynching has been
   stretched to signify various forms of violence. Even the modest number
   of scholarly research projects takes the term ``lynching{''} for
   granted. Considering the ambiguity surrounding it, this study analyzes
   and articulates the phenomena of lynchings in India, particularly during
   the period 2000-2021 while undertaking a genealogical study to
   illustrate the history, and the meaning of the word and how it has
   evolved over the years alongside the associated phenomena. To do so is
   to take away the misleading objectivity the word can sometimes generate.
   Following the conceptualization of lynchings and its changing expression
   in different societies, particularly the United States of America, the
   article highlights in what ways the definition and content of lynching
   have become more symbolically charged and the reasons for the change as
   well as what made lynching an extraordinary form of violence.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a global phenomenon affecting millions of people.
   Lowincome people and communities are particularly at risk because of
   limited capacities to cope with climate-related stresses. Differential
   access to social and economic resources determines the level of adaptive
   potential; thus, the variations in social vulnerability to climate
   change. This article explores how unequal power relations influence the
   level of vulnerability in rural agrarian Bangladesh. Using data from the
   coastal region, it specifically discusses ethnicity, religion, gender,
   and farm size as the sources and manifestations of power relations in
   Bangladeshi rural society. I argue that the deeply rooted institutions
   of power in the country shape access to important resources that might
   increase adaptive capacity and thus resilience in the context of rapid
   climate change.},

Abstract = {May elections change a communist regime? From the rulers' perspective,
   mobilization should ensure high voter turnout and support to signal
   invincibility; high-visibility better-known national and provincial
   candidates should outperform local candidates; voters should believe
   that the government will improve the economy; generals-as-candidates
   should receive strong support. These are official reasons to persuade
   voters. The official leadership and media convey this perspective
   relentlessly. It worked for Cuba's 2018 but not for its 2023 election.
   Building on elections and regimes scholarship, this article analyses
   those two noncompetitive parliamentary elections, where only one party
   was lawful, and the number of candidates equalled the number of seats.
   The law clustered candidates in multimember districts; all won, but
   voters could cast nonconforming votes (blank, null, or selective).
   Between 2018 and 2023, turnout fell, nonconforming votes spiked, and
   electoral disaffection nationalized. Reported votes dropped
   significantly for generals, provincial governors, and provincial
   communist-party first-secretaries. Ministers associated with economic
   reforms performed better than other ministers, while Political Bureau
   leaders held their vote shares. Cuba inched toward democratization,
   through reform but not rupture.},

Title = {Public Policy Adoption in Multilevel Government Contexts: Explaining
   Provincial Responses to Covid-19 in Argentina},
Journal = {REVISTA SAAP},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {249-286},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {How were public policy responses to the Covid-19 pandemic at the
   subnational level in Argentina? Why have these responses varied across
   provinces and over time? By using panel data and the University of
   Miami's Public Policy Adoption Index (PPAI) as the dependent variable,
   this paper identifies the determinants of subnational responses. The
   statistical analysis suggests that these responses were influenced by
   epidemiological factors (number of Covid-19 cases), sociodemographic
   factors (relative size of the at-risk population), socioeconomic factors
   (economic development), and political factors (alignment with the
   national government), which is consistent with previous studies.
   Additionally, this study introduces a new variable to the literature on
   public policy responses to the pandemic: employment structure.},

Abstract = {This research analyses the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the
   United States of America elections held in November 2020. We analyse the
   29th of September and the 22nd of October debates in which candidates
   Donald Trump and Joe Biden participated. Content analysis is used as the
   research technique. The frequency and time spent by each candidate on
   the Covid-19 topic are measured. In addition, it is analysed the content
   of the speeches in general and the communication and discursive
   strategies employed by both candidates. Both verbal and non-verbal
   language and the elements linked to the staging of the debates are
   analysed too. Among other issues, the results show the importance of the
   pandemic in the debates, Biden explicitly took a pro-scientific stance,
   while Trump leaned towards a sceptical stance, and it was found that the
   communicative styles and strategies of both candidates have differed
   throughout the events analysed.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to update the depictions of Argentine
   federalism. This analysis considers that the most common interpretation,
   which we will refer to as the ``canonical{''} portrayal, is outdated.
   Argentine federalism no longer functions in the same way as described in
   the 1990s and early 2000s. This is evidenced by the results of
   provincial gubernatorial elections, where elected candidates do not
   strictly align with the expectations of the canonical depiction. This
   trend began around 2015 and was reinforced in subsequent elections.
   Therefore, it is important to document these changes in order to
   understand the new realities and to more accurately describe the
   mechanisms that persist amidst the identified changes.},

Abstract = {Commentary about the successes of the `Teals' and the Greens in the 2022
   federal election echoes scholarship regarding the ongoing fragmentation
   of major party support, weakening partisan alignment, and the rise of
   post-materialist voting since the 1970s. To explore the dynamics behind
   this trend, we construct a novel dataset of independent and minor party
   members of parliament elected to single-member electorates in Australian
   lower houses since 1970, empirically exploring the circumstances through
   which these candidates are successful. Tracing the rise of independent
   and minor party MPs, we observe that initially, these MPs often emerged
   through lower levels of government and outside organised politics,
   while, more recently they have succeeded through party structures and
   what we term `party-like' forms of organisation. Our results suggest
   that political fragmentation is increasingly a challenge to conservative
   politics, especially via the rise of organised party-like independents,
   representing a realignment from the twentieth century.},

Abstract = {China has insisted that the BRI is a policy of openness, inclusiveness,
   and win-win rather than a geopolitical exercise or the Chinese version
   of the Marshall Plan. By exploring the repeated setbacks in the BRI
   cooperation between South Korea and China over the past 10 years, this
   study found that the BRI cooperation is a product of geopolitical
   considerations and that it is vulnerable to geopolitical conditions and
   factors. It also implies that unless the geopolitical rivalry between
   the United States and China over the Korean Peninsula is alleviated or
   the reality of the North-South Korea's divide is overcome, neither the
   alignment of South Korea's initiatives with China's BRI nor the
   expansion of the BRI to Northeast Asia will be easy.},

Abstract = {While prior scholarship has dedicated substantial attention to
   theoretically discussing communicative democracy, there has been a
   notable dearth of empirical research examining its political
   implications. This study endeavors to bridge this gap by exploring the
   impact of prioritizing communicative democracy in policy-making on
   electoral support. Through a conjoint experiment conducted in Taiwan,
   this study finds that candidates who emphasize communicative democracy,
   characterized by transparent communication, active engagement, and
   meaningful dialogue, are more likely to be chosen by voters over those
   who focus on majority rule. This preference highlights a broader desire
   for inclusivity and policies reflecting diverse viewpoints. As the first
   empirical investigation, the findings contribute to our understanding of
   voter values around communication and inclusivity in democracy,
   indicating a shift toward valuing collaborative policy development.},

Abstract = {Issue ownership is an important determinant of the vote, and it is
   electorally beneficial for parties to build a strong reputation on their
   core issues. Even though issue ownership has already been studied
   extensively in the party literature, we know less about how citizens
   form ownership perceptions. We contribute to this literature by means of
   two studies on the connection between party behaviour and perceptions of
   issue ownership, with an empirical focus on issue competence reputations
   of parties. In Study 1, we combine party-level information about issue
   attention, positions and performance with data on competence perceptions
   from a wide range of national election studies. Study 2 is a
   pre-registered conjoint experiment designed to examine the causal link
   between party behaviour and perceived competence. Our results point to
   significant effects for all three hypothesised sources of competence
   reputations. Moving beyond previous work that has argued that competence
   reputations are mostly stable over time, after accounting for the
   variation due to parties' popularity, our results show that they
   fluctuate in the short term and that parties have some level of control
   over how they are perceived.},

Title = {Benefits by Luck: A Study of Lotteries as a Selection Method for
   Government Programs},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Lotteries could be a just and cost-effective procedure to distribute
   government benefits in contexts of oversubscription, with the added
   benefit of allowing assessments of the impact of government programs.
   However, little is known about whether there is public support for
   employing lotteries in this context. We examine support for a lottery
   that selects recipients of new government-built housing units in Brazil
   and find that neither lotteries participants nor the general public
   supports their use. We arrive at this result by employing a
   three-pronged multi-method approach. Quasi-experimental analysis of an
   original survey of lottery participants reveals that support not only is
   tepid, but substantially higher among winners than non-winners. In-depth
   interviews suggest that applicants believe lotteries miss the most
   deserving beneficiaries. A general population survey experiment reveals
   that lotteries are not perceived as just or efficient when compared to
   alternative beneficiary selection methods. While sometimes normatively
   desirable, the use of lotteries for government programs enjoys limited
   popular support.},

Abstract = {In many elections across the world, the regime in power uses violence to
   influence electoral dynamics and outcomes. What is the effect of such
   violence on citizens' attitudes to democracy? We argue that the effect
   of government-perpetrated electoral violence on citizens' democratic
   commitment will diverge depending on whether the individual supports the
   ruling or opposition party. While those affiliated with the opposition
   should become more likely to support democracy in the wake of government
   violence, we expect those affiliated with the incumbent to support more
   power concentrated in the hands of the executive. We examine these
   expectations using cross-national, geo-referenced survey data from the
   Afrobarometer, alongside event data on electoral violence. We find that
   while incumbent supporters generally display lower baseline support for
   democracy in the absence of violence, violent elections do not further
   erode their democratic commitment. Violence is, however, associated with
   increased support for democracy amongst opposition supporters.},

Abstract = {During the Voice to Parliament referendum campaign, `yes' advocates
   argued that a failed referendum would harm Australia's international
   reputation. To what extent did this occur? This article examines how the
   Voice to Parliament spoke to Australia's international reputation and
   why it matters for foreign policy. It maps the global producers of
   reputation narratives and theorises about which, when and why specific
   audiences might matter for how reputation affects foreign policy. Using
   a unique combination of materials collected from Meltwater and Global
   NewsBank databases, it tracks how the Voice to Parliament campaign and
   its results were interpreted by various international audiences, with a
   specific focus on global media. The implications for foreign policy are
   likely to be mixed while the result may be weaponised by other states
   and limit Australia's ability to make credible moral claims in
   international fora, geopolitical considerations are likely to reduce its
   overall effect on Australia's international agenda.},

Abstract = {AI breakthroughs have sent shockwaves through the HE sector. Reactions
   have ranged from concern over academic integrity to excitement that
   large language models (LLM) might allow automating lower-stakes
   intellectual tasks. This paper tests some of these arguments using a
   mixed-methods research design to analyze an original dataset of 120
   ChatGPT-generated essays on far-right politics based on prompts on
   different levels of Bloom's revised taxonomy. Our findings echo results
   that LLM-generated essays generally achieve solid to good marks.
   However, we find no linear negative trend between the level on Bloom and
   the quality of essays produced. Essays' quality was weaker on the lowest
   and highest levels of the taxonomy and strongest on intermediate levels,
   even when controlling for the version of ChatGPT and the round of data
   collection. The in-depth reading revealed distinctive limitations in
   argument construction and empirical detail-particularly regarding
   ``hallucinations{''} and source misattributions-which could only be
   marginally improved through prompt engineering. In turn, ChatGPT was
   better at suggesting ``places to look{''} for helpful information,
   meaning it might be more accurately compared to a signpost rather than a
   calculator. The implications for politics assessments and teaching are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {While the extreme right wing (ERW) has not gained a foothold in local or
   national Irish politics, the country has witnessed a growth in online
   activism and harassment, and physical protest and violence. This paper
   explores a case study based on 4876 unique posts from one Irish-based
   Telegram group active during six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
   main findings are that: (a) this group was heavily influenced by foreign
   content and influencers, in particular, American ERW content and
   conspiracies associated with QAnon; (b) conspiracy theories were not
   adopted wholesale but adapted for an Irish audience; (c) Irish actors
   were not passive receivers of US content, and multi-directional
   exchanges of ideas were witnessed. While generalising beyond the case
   study analysed in this paper would require further data, this may
   suggest that Irish influencers are part of a transnational online
   ecosystem in which ideas and theories are shared and adapted to local
   contexts. These findings offer insights into the ERW in Ireland and,
   more generally, how the ERW communicates and spread conspiracy theories
   across national borders.},

Abstract = {In the first field experiments to encourage participation in local civic
   bodies, I examine whether outreach can reduce inequalities in who
   participates in city council meetings. Renter participation in local
   politics lags that of home owners, who often participate to oppose
   housing growth. A total of 19,951 renter households received randomly
   assigned emails encouraging them to comment at their city council
   meetings and support housing growth. Opening a message highlighting
   potential costs of abstention from local politics increased public
   comments by 1.4 percentage points versus a placebo. These effects are
   substantively large: treatment-induced comments represented 8\% of total
   comments and 46\% of pro-housing comments across all targeted meetings.
   The results suggest that even low-cost outreach strategies can
   meaningfully increase participation in lesser known settings like city
   councils and make these bodies more reflective of the general public.
   Further, increasing the perception that abstention is costly appears to
   be an effective motivator of collective action.},

Abstract = {Ancient accounts of Kleisthenes's democratizing reforms to the Athenian
   constitution in 508/507 B.C.E. do not elaborate on the reasons why these
   reforms found widespread support and thus proved stable. While scholars
   are confident that Kleisthenes divided Athenian citizens into ten
   geographically representative tribes and assigned them to local units of
   government, they do not agree about why these reforms produced a
   thoroughgoing democracy. This paper argues that Kleisthenes instituted
   reforms to religious practices and structures that supplied ideational
   content to the political reforms. This paper also attempts to
   demonstrate that some of the religious elements that Kleisthenes
   repurposed to serve the democratic constitution had been politicized in
   the previous century. Religious observance was thus one of the sites
   where contestation about Athens' political direction furnished
   democratic conceptual vocabulary. Athenians who wished to see civic
   institutions become more inclusive could be and were appealed to through
   reforms to everyday religious practice.},

Abstract = {The article explores what has come to be known as the unity trap by
   means of several examples of positions that oppose the recognition of
   rights for transgender people. This unity trap aims to preserve sexual
   binarism. This objective is outlined in the text as part of a
   modern/colonial technology. Finally, through various categories
   constructed from the feminisms of the global south, several legal
   examples (especially jurisprudential ones) are highlighted, which allow
   us to think of possibilities to break the unity trap and to legally
   construct diversity.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The relevance of policymaking stems from its utility in helping social
   systems manage the output of their constituent members by shaping
   behavioural and procedural processes. Whilst policymaking might be
   well-meaning, it does not always lead to satisfactory outcomes. Policy
   may fail in generating uptake or establishing intent. For this reason,
   the study of the psychological characteristics of citizens is pertinent
   in understanding reactions to policy. In the present study, we analysed
   policy communication and reception in Kuwait in terms of the worldviews
   they advance. We also studied media responses and worldview
   distributions amongst the public (n = 1400). Our findings demonstrate
   both within and between worldview differences in reactions to science
   policy. We observed an engagement effect between worldviews and their
   appreciation of science policy. We also observed a within worldviews
   mobilisation effect, by which differential reactions to science policy
   are activated once engaged. Our conclusions suggest that policymakers
   would benefit from a broader management of worldviews and psychological
   characteristics beyond traditional sociodemographic influences.},

Abstract = {This study explores the divergent diplomatic choices of Central American
   countries regarding recognition of Beijing versus Taipei between 2000
   and 2018, despite their similar geopolitical and socioeconomic contexts.
   We analyze foreign policy shifts in Costa Rica, Panama, the Dominican
   Republic, and El Salvador (G1 group), which established diplomatic
   relations with China, in contrast to Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, and
   Belize (G2 group), which maintained recognition of Taiwan. Utilizing
   process-tracing and fuzzy-sets qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA),
   our findings indicate that no single condition is both necessary and
   sufficient to account for the diplomatic transitions observed in G1.
   However, Chinese Development Assistance (ODA) emerges as the condition
   most closely associated with these shifts due to its empirical
   consistency. We identify two sufficient combinations of conditions that
   drive diplomatic change: both include Increased Exports to China (EXP),
   the PRC's Position in Export Markets (PEXP), Chinese Development
   Assistance (ODA), and Left-wing or Center-left Ruling Party Ideology
   (PP). In addition, for Costa Rica specifically, the Repudiation of
   Corruption Cases Involving Former Leaders Associated with Taiwan (CTW)
   plays a significant role. These findings highlight the complex interplay
   of economic factors, political ideologies, and corruption in shaping the
   diplomatic strategies of Central American nations.},

Abstract = {An aim of committing terror is to instill fear in the population. This
   article explores to what extent Swedish citizens were cognitively,
   emotionally, and behaviorally affected by the 2017 terrorist attack in
   Stockholm and how the citizens perceived that the authorities handled
   the situation. The study is based on data from a survey with 1996
   participants, consisting of a random sample of people living in Sweden,
   aged 18-79 years. Our results show that exposure to terrorist acts has a
   significant negative psychological impact on the population in general
   and on those who do not feel part of Swedish society in particular. The
   attack's negative effect was despite the fact that the vast majority of
   respondents felt that society had handled the attack well and almost
   half of the respondents stated that they had gained increased confidence
   in the authorities.},

Abstract = {Social media has become an increasingly important tool for parties to
   set issues on the political agenda. However, its rapid rise raises
   questions about the role of traditional venues such as parliaments. This
   study hypothesizes that parties strategically choose to initiate issues
   in parliamentary debates instead of on social media to establish
   dominance through real-time discussions. Consequently, only after these
   issues are introduced and debated in parliament do parties use digital
   platforms like social media to reinforce them on the political agenda.
   Analyzing over 430,000 parliamentary speeches and 240,000 Facebook posts
   by parties in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, and the UK, from 2010
   to 2022, the study reveals that issues discussed in parliamentary
   debates-primarily those raised by opposition parties-typically do not
   initially emerge on social media but only attract online attention after
   being introduced in parliament. These findings offer new insights into
   the strategic decisions of parties in agenda-setting.
   Soziale Medien sind f \& uuml;r Parteien zunehmend wichtig geworden, um
   Themen auf die politische Agenda zu setzen. Ihr schneller Aufstieg wirft
   jedoch Fragen \& uuml;ber die Rolle traditioneller Kan \& auml;le wie
   z.B. Parlamente auf. Diese Studie geht davon aus, dass Parteien
   strategisch vorgehen, indem sie Themen in parlamentarischen Debatten
   anstatt in sozialen Medien einf \& uuml;hren, um durch die Diskussionen
   in Echtzeit Dominanz zu etablieren. Erst wenn ein Thema im Parlament
   eingef \& uuml;hrt und debattiert wurde, nutzen Parteien digitale
   Plattformen um das Thema auf der politischen Agenda zu verst \&
   auml;rken. Die Analyse von \& uuml;ber 430.000 parlamentarischen Reden
   und 240.000 Facebook-Beitr \& auml;gen aus den Jahren 2010 bis 2022 von
   Parteien in Australien, Belgien, Kanada, Kroatien und dem Vereinigten K
   \& ouml;nigreich zeigt, dass Themen, die in parlamentarischen Debatten
   (haupts \& auml;chlich von Oppositionsparteien) besprochen werden, zun
   \& auml;chst nicht in sozialen Medien auftauchen, sondern erst nach der
   Einf \& uuml;hrung im Parlament auch online Aufmerksamkeit erregen.
   Diese Ergebnisse bieten neue Einblicke in die strategischen
   Entscheidungen von Parteien bei der Agenda-Setzung.
   Les m \& eacute;dias sociaux sont devenus un outil important pour les
   partis pour mettre des enjeux \& agrave; l'ordre du jour politique. Leur
   mont \& eacute;e rapide soul \& egrave;ve des questions sur le r \&
   ocirc;le des sites traditionnels, tels que les parlements. Cette \&
   eacute;tude suppose que les partis choisissent strat \& eacute;giquement
   d'introduire les sujets dans les d \& eacute;bats parlementaires plut \&
   ocirc;t que sur les m \& eacute;dias sociaux pour \& eacute;tablir une
   domination \& agrave; travers des discussions en temps r \& eacute;el.
   En cons \& eacute;quence, les partis utilisent les plateformes num \&
   eacute;riques uniquement apr \& egrave;s que ces sujets ont \& eacute;t
   \& eacute; introduits et d \& eacute;battus au parlement pour les
   renforcer sur l'agenda politique. En analysant plus de 430 000 discours
   parlementaires et 240 000 publications Facebook de partis en Australie,
   en Belgique, au Canada, en Croatie et au Royaume-Uni de 2010 \& agrave;
   2022, l'\& eacute;tude r \& eacute;v \& egrave;le que les sujets d \&
   eacute;battus au parlement - principalement ceux des partis d'opposition
   - g \& eacute;n \& eacute;ralement attirent une attention en ligne
   seulement apr \& egrave;s leur introduction au parlement. Ces r \&
   eacute;sultats offrent de nouvelles perspectives sur les d \&
   eacute;cisions strat \& eacute;giques des partis en mati \& egrave;re de
   d \& eacute;finition de l'agenda.
   I social media sono diventati uno strumento sempre pi \& ugrave;
   importante per i partiti al fine di inserire temi nell'agenda politica.
   Tuttavia, il loro rapido sviluppo solleva interrogativi sul ruolo dei
   luoghi tradizionali come i parlamenti. Questo studio ipotizza che i
   partiti scelgano strategicamente di avviare i temi nei dibattiti
   parlamentari anzich \& eacute; sui social media per ottenere una
   posizione dominante attraverso discussioni in tempo reale. Di
   conseguenza, i partiti utilizzano le piattaforme digitali come i social
   media solo dopo che questi temi sono stati avviati e dibattuti in
   parlamento, per rafforzarli nell'agenda politica. Analizzando oltre
   430.000 discorsi parlamentari e 240.000 post su Facebook dei partiti dal
   2010 al 2022 in Australia, Belgio, Canada, Croazia e Regno Unito,
   l'indagine rivela che i temi discussi nei dibattiti parlamentari -
   principalmente quelli dei partiti di opposizione - solitamente non
   emergono inizialmente sui social media, ma attirano attenzione online
   solo dopo essere stati avviati in parlamento. Questi risultati offrono
   nuovi spunti di riflessione sulle decisioni strategiche dei partiti
   nella definizione dell'agenda.},

Title = {Policy feedback and voter turnout: Evidence from the Finnish basic
   income experiment},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 20},
Abstract = {In many democracies, unemployed and low-income citizens are less willing
   to vote. Can social policies weaken the link between income and turnout?
   We study policy feedback leveraging a unique experiment in Finland,
   which randomly assigned a sizable group of unemployed to receiving an
   unconditional basic income (BI) for 2 years (2017-19). Combining
   individual-level registry and survey data, we show that the intervention
   has large positive effects on voter turnout. Unconditional BI increases
   turnout in municipal elections by about 3 percentage points (p.p.), on
   average, an effect that is concentrated among marginal voters (+ 6-8
   p.p.) and persists in national elections after the end of the
   experiment. Exploring possible mechanisms, our analysis highlights the
   role of the interpretive effects that follow from unconditionality in
   the bureaucratic process, including higher levels of political trust and
   efficacy. We discuss implications for theories of voter turnout and
   policy feedback, and the design of BI policies.},

Abstract = {Studies have found that women's representation is more likely to spike
   after corruption scandals. However, the mechanism underlying this
   increase remains unclear: are parties more likely to nominate women
   after corruption scandals, are voters more likely to support women
   candidates, or is it a combination of both? Using an original dataset of
   audit results and the gender of 47,000 candidates running in over 10,000
   mayoral elections in Mexico (2000-2019), we find that voters drive the
   effect. While political parties are not more likely to nominate women as
   candidates in municipalities with recent revelations of spending
   irregularities, women candidates are more likely to win elections after
   corruption is uncovered. In contrast to previous studies, which expect
   strategic parties to be behind the increases in women's representation
   following corruption scandals, our findings underscore that increases in
   women's representation can happen despite parties and not because of
   parties.},

Abstract = {The global surge of political polarization poses a significant threat to
   liberal democracies. The prevailing ``us-versus-them{''} mentality
   prevents leaders from effectively addressing societal issues. While
   intergroup dialogue shows promise in bridging divisions among diverse
   identity groups, the dynamics of real-life conversations between
   individuals with opposing political identities remain underexplored.
   This study investigates a unique case study of constructive face-to-face
   interactions among American political elites on a contentious issue. By
   examining how opposing leaders collaborate towards shared goals, the
   research identifies communicative actions that can reduce polarization.
   This study delves into the complex dynamics of polarization, as both an
   issue-based and identity-based conflict, focusing on interactional
   framing strategies leaders use to navigate their differences. The
   findings reveal that political leaders bridge ideological divides by
   embracing multiple frames, reconnecting conflicting frames, and
   developing neutral non-political frames. They also foster positive
   relations, use superordinate identities, and decrease social distance,
   thereby bridging their identity gap. By fostering convergence rather
   than accentuating differences, they effectively counteract polarization.
   Studying rare examples of constructive bipartisan collaboration offers
   valuable insights into reducing polarization, restoring political trust
   among the general public, and mitigating broader societal impacts,
   ultimately strengthening the foundations of a healthy democracy.},

Abstract = {Este art \& iacute;culo tiene como objetivo explicar por qu \& eacute;
   aument \& oacute; la participaci \& oacute;n en las elecciones
   presidenciales entre las personas que tem \& iacute;an el riesgo de que
   el COVID-19 empeorara en \& Aacute;frica. El an \& aacute;lisis se basa
   en una muestra de 16.890 personas que viven en 34 pa \& iacute;ses
   africanos. Los resultados econom \& eacute;tricos sugieren que el miedo
   a la escalada de la pandemia puede reducir la disposici \& oacute;n de
   los ciudadanos a participar en las elecciones presidenciales. Sin
   embargo, este efecto negativo cambia seg \& uacute;n las percepciones
   sobre la gesti \& oacute;n gubernamental de la pandemia. Mostramos que
   la probabilidad de votar en una elecci \& oacute;n presidencial aumenta
   significativamente entre quienes temen que la pandemia empeore debido a:
   (i) una falta de confianza en las estad \& iacute;sticas gubernamentales
   sobre COVID-19; (ii) corrupci \& oacute;n percibida relacionada con la
   pandemia de COVID-19; (iii) falta de confianza en la capacidad del
   gobierno para garantizar la seguridad de las vacunas COVID-19; (iv) la
   percepci \& oacute;n de inversi \& oacute;n p \& uacute;blica
   insuficiente para combatir las emergencias sanitarias; y (v) percepci \&
   oacute;n de una intervenci \& oacute;n insuficiente por parte de las
   fuerzas del orden para hacer cumplir las medidas de control de COVID-19.},

Abstract = {Populist Radical Right parties (PRR) have gained prominence in many
   European countries, with leadership often considered a key factor in
   their electoral success. Despite this, limited research has explored how
   voters' perceptions of leaders' traits influence support for PRR
   parties. This study delves into the impact of perceived leaders' traits
   on the vote for PRR parties, using original survey data collected during
   recent general elections in six European countries (Italy 2022, France
   2017, Germany 2017, Austria 2017, UK 2017, Netherlands 2017). Combining
   descriptive findings and regression analyses, our results reveal three
   key insights: (1) Voters differentiate among leaders' traits, with the
   influence of each trait varying across different party types; (2) the
   effect of leader's perceptions on all traits is significant also after
   taking into account party identification; (3) PRR parties are
   particularly adept at attracting voters based on positive assessments of
   leaders' strength and empathy, more so than other party types.},

Title = {Too Crooked to be Good? Trade-offs in the Electoral Punishment of
   Malfeasance and Corruption},

Abstract = {While elections are an instrument to hold politicians accountable,
   corrupt politicians are often re-elected. A potential explanation for
   this paradox is that citizens trade-off integrity for competence. Voters
   may forgive corruption if corrupt politicians manage to deliver
   desirable outcomes. While previous studies have examined whether
   politicians' competence moderates the negative effect of corruption,
   this paper focuses on voters' priorities and directly assesses what
   citizens value more: integrity or favourable outcomes. Using a survey
   experiment, we assess citizens' support for politicians who violate the
   law in order to improve the welfare of their community and, in some
   cases, benefit personally from these violations. The results indicate
   that citizens prefer a politician who follows the law, even if this
   leads to a suboptimal outcome. However, voters are more likely to
   overlook violations of the law that benefit the community if these do
   not result in a personal gain for politicians (i.e., in the absence of
   corruption). These findings suggest that the mild electoral punishment
   of corruption may be due to the public's unawareness of private gains
   from malfeasance, or to the delay in these private benefits becoming
   apparent by election day.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 11},
Abstract = {This article seeks to advance the discussions on our moral obligations
   towards refugees of protracted crises by proposing a nuanced application
   of outcome responsibility. Differentiating causal and outcome
   responsibility through intention, involvement, and side-taking
   principles has both symbolic and practical significance in assigning
   reparative and remedial duties. The framework utilizes domestic
   analogies to help explain the refined version of these two
   responsibility types. It examines the Syrian crisis within this paradigm
   to offer a clearer understanding of the actors that are `morally
   obligated and more likely' to help. This argument addresses political
   communities instead of their states, emphasizing their pivotal role as
   bearers of the consequences of state decisions. Employing an outcome
   responsibility-based sense of ethical duty (ORSED) can foster more
   inclusive and welcoming environments, mitigating resentment regardless
   of border controls or burden allocation.},

Title = {Exploring affordable housing policy in federal states: social housing
   and housing allowances in Australia, Austria, Canada, and Germany},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 10},
Abstract = {In federal states, constituent units play an important role in
   affordable housing policy. Nevertheless, insights into affordable
   housing policy in federations are lacking. To lay the grounds for future
   research about an increasingly salient policy field, this research note
   explores the degree of de/centralization in affordable housing policy in
   Australia, Austria, Canada, and Germany, focusing on the two main policy
   instruments: social housing and the housing allowance. The research note
   develops an analytical framework that allows the examination of the
   relative significance of the federal government and the constituent
   units, and it applies this framework to the four countries. The research
   note highlights that legislative authority often does not fully capture
   the degree of de/centralization. Governments' decision to provide a
   policy instrument, the relative importance of policy instruments, the
   provision of conditional grants, and the existence of a functional
   division of powers must also be considered.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to explore how public servants in Iceland
   experience harsh discourse and harassment in their profession, and to
   investigate resources to combat this type of behavior. Increasingly
   ruthless discourse, commonly blamed on social media, has led to harsher
   communication and harassment against public servants. A qualitative
   study was conducted in which public servants in Iceland were
   interviewed. The approaches of grounded theory and thematic analysis
   were used to extract themes from the data. The results of the study are
   divided into five themes: Altered discourse concerning the government,
   public servants' personal experience regarding harsh discourse and
   harassment, fear and defense mechanisms of public servants surrounding
   future threats, the powerless public servant, and helpless public
   servants who lack resources when faced with harsh discourse or
   harassment. Interviewees agreed that the public discourse in Iceland
   lacked boundaries towards public servants. They felt defenselessness
   against public discussion because they were obliged to observe secrecy
   and could not rectify misinformation on social media or in the media.
   Several had experienced severe cases of harsh discourse and harassment,
   for example name and photo disclosures, doxing, ambushing, stalking,
   threats, cyberbullying and physical violence. They perceived the system
   as useless and felt that they did not receive appropriate assistance.
   Interviewees were asked to propose solutions to the problem, which
   included better support for victims, joint contingency plan for the
   government, strengthening legal measures to protect public servants, and
   the hiring of press secretaries for government offices.},
