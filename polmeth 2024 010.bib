Title = {US BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS ON CHINA: THE MAKING AND THE IMPLEMENTATION},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-44},
Abstract = {According to the most experts, there is a bipartisan consensus in the
   United States regarding China: both parties recognize that China poses
   an existential threat to the United States, its economy, socio-political
   structure and the role as a global leader. This core conceptual consent
   represents a clear contrast with the endless battles between Democrats
   and Republicans in the domestic political arena, blocking any
   legislative initiatives and the development of a unified sociopolitical
   agenda for the country. This rare unity has made many observers to claim
   the emergence of a new external enemy, in the face of which America will
   be able to overcome its identical crisis and to come back to national
   unity. The political elite also actively uses the image of the enemy,
   calling on the Nation for unity. This article is aimed to understand
   what lies behind political slogans and the bipartisan concept of
   confronting China. The study is based on the analysis of several sources
   that make it possible to judge the attitude towards China in the United
   States along party lines, specific to each level of the party-political
   system- party platforms at the federal level, legislative initiatives at
   the state and city levels, public opinion polls at the level of the
   society. The research hypothesis is that Democrats and Republicans, who
   agree on the conceptual vision of the Chinese threat, offer different
   ways to counter it. The difference in methods of struggle stems from
   different ideological and value models that manifest themselves in the
   implementation of both the socioeconomic agenda within the country and
   foreign policy strategies in the international arena. The unity of the
   parties ends exactly by the developing of a conceptual framework for
   confrontation with the opponent. The implementation of specific steps of
   the anti-Chinese agenda at the state and city levels is taking place in
   accordance with the ideological and political guidelines of each party,
   and the public attitude towards the Chinese threat demonstrates a clear
   split along party lines. The conceptual positioning of a new external
   enemy instead of unification brought to the United States anti-Chinese
   hysteria among conservative politicians at the state level, which was
   realized in the adoption of discriminatory laws in Republican states
   against Chinese citizens and a new wave of anti-Chinese sentiment in
   society, manifested in outbreaks of violence against Asian minorities.},

Title = {Selective Inclusion? Insights Into Political Parties' Recruitment of
   Immigrant Background Candidates in Bolzano},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Political parties can be crucial gatekeepers to the political
   participation of immigrants. This article analyzes the political
   selection strategies of political parties at the local level. The case
   study focuses on the multi-ethnic city of Bolzano in Northern Italy,
   which is home to a significant migrant population as well as three
   autochthonous language groups: Italian, German, and Ladin. First, the
   article gives an overview of the political lists presented at the last
   local elections in 2020. Second, it discusses party strategies to
   recruit candidates with an immigration background. The presented
   insights are drawn from seven ``elite{''} interviews (i.e., with
   high-ranking party representatives). Overall, the findings indicate that
   diversity stemming from migration does not have a significant impact on
   the recruitment strategies of the province's political parties': Despite
   electoral lists containing an increasing number of immigrants, who have
   migrated to South Tyrol since the 1990s, neither newer nor traditional
   parties adopt significant strategies to recruit candidates with an
   immigration background. Overall, the diversity on political lists mostly
   reflects the existing language cleavages of the autochthonous
   population, while diversity stemming from immigration is still largely
   overlooked. However, the results also show that while neither of the
   parties is fully inclusive or exclusive in their selection methods, we
   identify a tendency toward selective inclusiveness of certain immigrant
   groups.},

   effects of negative political messaging in multiparty systems with

Abstract = {Classical electoral behaviour theories have associated possible benefits
   of negative campaigning with two-party plurality systems due to their
   zero-sum nature. Nevertheless, negative campaigning is a widely used
   electoral strategy outside of these contexts, despite scant evidence of
   its benefits for political parties and candidates who employ it. Our
   research question is simple - is negative campaign messaging effective
   for attackers in multiparty systems with multimember districts? Or does
   it create a `boomerang effect' in this context, for which the producer
   of the message faces a backlash? Multiparty systems with multimember
   districts should, according to the literature, be scenarios where the
   effects of negative campaigning are most complex if not unpredictable.
   This paper uses Facebook political messages to inform a survey
   experiment design that tests the effects of negative political messaging
   on voters. We employ this survey in Ireland, which uses the single
   transferable vote, an electoral system which magnifies outcome
   uncertainty for attackers. Our results suggest that negative messaging
   in this context produces both the intended effect and a boomerang effect
   for the sponsor of the message. These countervailing results suggest a
   net null effect for the efficacy of negative messaging.},

Abstract = {A record number of candidates contested parliamentary seats in the 2024
   general election in the United Kingdom. This article discusses three key
   aspects that have garnered attention from both academics and
   practitioners studying the characteristics, motivations and experiences
   of candidates: gender representation, security concerns and local
   residency. Candidate data shows that, despite an increase in female MPs,
   the overall number of female candidates declined, highlighting
   structural barriers within party selection processes. Second, the rise
   in harassment, abuse and intimidation has led many candidates,
   particularly women, to withhold their home addresses on ballot papers,
   impacting their perceived local connection to voters. Finally, while
   localism remains a valued asset for candidates, security concerns
   diminish its role in contemporary campaigns. Challenges for future
   elections remain for political parties to address gender imbalances
   during the selection process, enhance candidate safety and reconsider
   local engagement strategies to foster a more inclusive and connected
   political landscape.},

Title = {When Serving the Public Interest Generates Private Gains: Private Actor
   Governance and Two-Sided Digital Markets},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 18},
Abstract = {From speech to privacy, broad public interests are increasingly governed
   online by policy decisions taken by private companies. We examine when
   and how fi rms make such decisions. In contrast to the shadow of
   hierarchy and functionalist explanations of private authority, we build
   an analytical framework based on business power and the economics
   literature concerned with two-sided markets. We argue that companies
   operating as digital platforms may use private actor governance to
   consolidate their influence. More precisely, public-interest regulation
   on one side of the market (e.g., protecting the privacy of end-users)
   may increase the dependence of fi rms on the other side of the market
   (e.g., increasing the price paid for information by advertisers). We
   probe our argument by looking at the privacy policy implemented by Apple
   in 2021. Our fi ndings demonstrate the growing role played by digital
   companies in global regulatory debates and call attention to how market
   structures can simultaneously incentivize public- interest regulation
   and become a source of business power.},

Title = {Who's That Knocking? A Study of the Strategic Choices Facing Large-Scale
   Grassroots Canvassing Efforts},
Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 13},
Abstract = {Although recent political science research has established that
   face-to-face contacting mobilizes eligible citizens to vote, the
   emphasis on field experiments to facilitate causal inference has
   occasionally come at the expense of a deeper knowledge of how campaigns
   develop and implement canvassing and get-out-the-vote (GOTV) programs.
   We rely on a case study from a major statewide campaign in Texas to
   identify and explore the strategic considerations leading to the
   deployment of a large-scale paid field operation. Among the campaign
   management challenges in carrying out a statewide canvassing effort, we
   address the recruitment, retention, and supervision of canvassers; the
   choice of target neighborhoods and voters; the variable response of
   voters at the doorstep; setting and reaching performance goals; the
   timing of contacts; detailed recordkeeping; and the turnout results. In
   detailing this effort, we draw upon insights from interviews with
   staffers, field observations, and the campaign's detailed data on
   response at the doorstep for a target list of 2.5 million voters. In the
   end, we find that strategic decisions are myriad and complex, and that
   they almost certainly condition the impact of canvassing and GOTV
   operations.},

Abstract = {Extensive research explores the relationship between deepening conflict
   over socio-cultural issues and stagnating social mobility, typically
   focusing on men. Upwardly mobile women are routinely mentioned as
   belonging to the progressive ``winners{''} of the knowledge-based
   society, yet their experiences and politics have received far less
   attention. This paper theorizes and investigates how women view their
   individual and collective trajectories and how these views relate to
   perceptions of future opportunities and political attitudes. Using
   survey data from four West European countries, we find that, while
   experiencing upward intergenerational mobility at the individual level
   is associated with positive opportunity perceptions, this relationship
   is not more pronounced among women than men nor linked to especially
   progressive attitudes. Rather, it is women sharing a sense of upward
   collective momentum who demand further action to achieve gender
   equality. This contrasts with men-including those perceiving themselves
   as upwardly mobile-who also acknowledge women's collective gains: they
   more readily accept the still male-dominated status quo.},

Abstract = {This essay takes stock of the current state of scholarship on gendered
   careers in the European Union. Examining the careers of women in the
   political system of the European Union raises several theoretical and
   analytical issues, especially considering the long-held reputation of
   European Union institutions as particularly favorable to the
   representation of women. First, it will ask whether scholarship has
   produced convincing evidence substantiating claims that European Union
   institutions are indeed more gender egalitarian in all aspects of the
   representational process, from the supply of candidates to shattering
   the glass ceiling of executive positions. Second, it asks whether
   scholarship has sufficiently theorized the contextual effects that
   account for the apparent success of women gaining representation in
   European Union institutions compared to national institutions.},

Abstract = {This research is based on the empirical fact that there is an increase
   in the status of villages from the majority of Underdeveloped and Very
   Underdeveloped Villages in 2022 to Developed Villages in 2023. This
   research focuses on discussing the development of very underdeveloped
   villages in Kampar Regency in the perspective of the quintuple helix,
   with the characteristics of wetland areas and conservation areas that
   have their own challenges in village development. This research is
   included in the qualitative approach with the type of phenomenology. The
   results of this study are based on the quintuple helix model which shows
   the cooperation of 5 (five) important actors, namely the state
   (government), private sector, academics, media, and the community as
   well as support from the natural environment in the village. Quintuple
   Helix, in this study, visualizes collective interaction and knowledge
   exchange through five subsystems (helix): (1) the education system, (2)
   the economic system, (3) the natural environment, (4) the media and
   culture-based society (as well as civil society), (5) and the political
   system. It can be concluded that the quintuple helix framework in this
   study has involved many of the previously mentioned actors but has not
   provided a significant impact on village development, especially
   villages that were previously very underdeveloped in Kampar Kiri Hulu
   District, Kampar Regency.},

Abstract = {The article claims that the dominant interpretations of the current
   crisis of democracy have many implicit normative assumptions as
   background and basis, previously established according to particular
   theories of democracy. Unraveling such assumptions may allow us to
   understand the theoretical limitations of such approaches as well as
   point out the politically self-destructive alternatives they project of
   either returning to the institutional model before the crisis or
   succumbing to authoritarianism. Examining the case of the functioning of
   Brazil's political system in recent decades, that initial approach
   should allow us to understand the specificity of the crisis of democracy
   in this country. As in the case of dominant explanations of the current
   crisis of democracy more broadly, the development on Brazil will also
   show the part that dominant explanations in political science play in
   it, and how it obscures the understanding of ongoing changes and the
   fight against the current authoritarian threat.},

Abstract = {This article examines the social base of support for Reform UK. Did
   Nigel Farage's new party depend on the same types of `left behind'
   voters who had previously backed UKIP? Do the results of the 2024
   election suggest a hardening of the social divides that underpinned the
   rise of UKIP? Or has Britain's Eurosceptic and anti-immigration movement
   broadened its social appeal, making these lines of conflict between
   different social groups less distinctive? Using a newly created dataset
   mapping election results from 1997-2019 onto the constituency boundaries
   which came into force for the 2024 election, and individual level data
   from the British Election Study Internet Panel, the findings presented
   here reveal remarkable continuity between the places that previously
   backed UKIP and those which now back Reform. Even though the salience of
   Brexit as an electoral issue has faded, there is little to indicate that
   the divides that underpinned support for leaving the EU have dissipated.},

Abstract = {This study examines how fuel pricing in Ghana has been used as a
   political tool to win votes and the government's role in this process.
   Applying Mile's Law, it explores post-truth theory through content
   analysis of secondary data and interviews with energy experts. The
   findings indicate that political parties gain significant political
   leverage by promising lower fuel prices during campaigns but fail to
   deliver once in office. The government's influence on fuel pricing is
   minimal, largely due to factors beyond its control. To stabilize fuel
   prices, the study recommends improving fiscal and economic performance
   to combat currency instability and educating the public on the factors
   influencing fuel pricing to prevent misinformation.Related

Abstract = {The 2020 US Presidential Election put the focus on the electability of
   women, and the emerging consensus is that perceptions of the sexism of
   others contribute to views that women are less able to win. Across two
   studies, however, I show that these results have only limited
   generalizability. While I do find that women are disadvantaged, there is
   no evidence of a significant connection to perceived sexism. In total,
   my results suggest that the ``it's not me, it's you{''} argument may not
   be as informative as previously thought, and that studies of
   electability need to consider a much broader number of factors beyond
   just sex.},

Title = {Anger expressions and coercive credibility in international crises},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 23},
Abstract = {Why are some threats more credible than others? I argue that leaders'
   anger expressions are a previously underappreciated source of coercive
   credibility. Specifically, leaders who express anger appear more
   credible because targets believe they are less sensitive to the costs of
   conflict. I test this argument through quantitative analysis of a novel
   dataset of world leaders' public statements in crises from 1946 to 1996
   and a U.S.-based survey experiment designed to test the mechanism. The
   observational evidence reveals that anger expressions increase the
   likelihood a threat will succeed. The experiment shows that anger
   expressions cause targets to infer greater resolve and that non-angry
   threats carry little credibility-and might even backfire. These findings
   not only shed light on a unique source of threat credibility but also
   highlight the crucial role of emotions in international relations with
   new data measuring political leaders' emotional expressions over time
   and space.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {92},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {While it is well-established that disability reduces the probability of
   electoral turnout, far less is known about the relationship between
   disability and support for particular political parties. Using
   nationally representative longitudinal data from Understanding Society
   we explore the relationship between disability and party support in
   England and Wales along left-right and protest dimensions. Consistent
   with our hypotheses, analysis of crosssectional data suggests that,
   after accounting for demographic characteristics, disabled people are
   significantly less likely to support parties to the right and more
   likely to support protest parties. In contrast, however, after
   accounting for time invariant individual unobserved heterogeneity using
   panel data methods, we find no evidence of a relationship between
   disability and left-right party support, and far less evidence of a
   relationship with protest parties. We discuss and attempt to reconcile
   these findings.},

Understanding more about boredom is crucial for the thesis on creating playful public furniture and installations in airport boarding areas. This understanding allows for the development of designs that not only engage passengers visually but also interactively, countering the typical monotony of waiting. By grasping the nuances of boredom, the designs can be tailored to stimulate interest, encourage interaction, and improve overall passenger experience, transforming waiting time from a passive to an active and enjoyable experience..

Title = {Can foreign aid reduce the desire to emigrate? Evidence from a
   randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 19},
Abstract = {Parallel to traditional immigration control policies, states send
   substantial amounts of foreign aid to address the root causes of
   migration. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we evaluate a
   representative type of ``root causes{''} aid (RCA) project in Africa,
   implemented by the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM).
   We find the project reduced aspirations to migrate and slowed
   preparations for the journey. Multiple mediation analysis shows
   ``instrumental place attachment{''}-or the ability to pursue important
   goals in one's place of residence compared to other destinations-is the
   main driver. However, effects wane 6 months after project end. That a
   small RCA project increased instrumental place attachment, albeit
   briefly, is significant given global inequalities. We explore this
   finding by conducting interviews with international organization (IO)
   and nongovernmental organization (NGO) practitioners to understand how
   development organizations affect instrumental place attachment, and with
   youth to understand how interventions (un)successfully moderate the
   choice to stay or migrate.},

Title = {Are solidarity and identification as people of color distinct?
   Validating new measures across Asian, Black, Latino, and Multiracial
   Americans},
Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 18},
Abstract = {Mounting U.S. research suggests many non-White individuals feel
   solidarity with, and identify as, people of color (PoC). Yet measurement
   limitations prevent scholars from testing whether these constructs are
   empirically different. We explain why these concepts diverge and
   evaluate our claims with an expanded battery of measures across U.S.
   Asian, Black, Latino, and Multiracial adults (N = 3402). Using
   multi-group confirmatory factor analysis, we show these items capture
   related but distinct concepts among PoC (configural invariance). We then
   establish that these items uniformly measure each construct across PoC
   groups (metric invariance), with mean level differences validly
   reflecting actual heterogeneity between groups, rather than measurement
   artifacts (scalar invariance). Finally, consistent with our
   conceptualization, we show that solidarity among PoC mediates the
   association between PoC identification and support for policies that
   implicate various communities of color. We end with practical advice for
   using these items in surveys of racially diverse populations.<br />},

Abstract = {Escalating hostility between partisans threatens democratic governance
   and social cohesion by eroding trust and fuelling discriminatory
   behaviour towards opposing groups. This study investigates how people
   perceive the relations between different partisan groups and why certain
   pairs of partisans are viewed as friendlier or more hostile towards one
   another. Drawing on similarity-attraction theory in social psychology
   and research on affective polarization, I argue that citizens perceive
   the relationship as more friendly between individuals who support
   ideologically similar parties. The claim is empirically supported
   through the use of a novel survey item that assesses the likelihood of
   two partisans becoming good friends, across three multi-party
   democracies: Canada, Germany, and the UK. The findings suggest that the
   ideological proximity of parties not only shapes citizens' perceptions
   of parties themselves but also influences their views of fellow citizens
   across party lines. By demonstrating that people consider party
   proximity and ideological alignment when evaluating inter-partisan
   relations, the study sheds light on how ideological and affective
   dimensions intertwine within these relationships in multi-party
   democracies.},

Abstract = {Contemporary states aiming to increase cost-effectiveness in public
   services through digitalisation advocate for digital citizenship. All
   citizens are expected to become fluent users of digital public services
   despite their varying circumstances. This study explores this issue for
   migrant women in Finland acquiring essential skills for digital
   citizenship: digital proficiency, fluency in the Finnish language, and
   understanding public administration. Using semi-structured interviews
   with structurally disadvantaged migrant women (N = 22), I analyse each
   skill acquisition as a complex temporal process. The analysis reveals
   that acquiring digital citizenship skills can be a prolonged process
   influenced by multiple temporal orders originating from both individual
   circumstances and external processes. Despite the investments made in
   acquiring these skills, citizens may remain unqualified. In conclusion,
   states that emphasize digital citizenship skills may assign structurally
   disadvantaged people a Sisyphean task, thereby leading to the narrowing
   of the realization of their citizen rights and, consequently, their
   citizenship.},

Abstract = {Most participatory strands of democratic theory hold a conception of the
   transformative potential of democratic participation. According to those
   theories, involvement in deliberative or decision-making processes makes
   better citizens by teaching them political skills and orienting them
   towards the common good. This article draws from original interviews
   with residents of housing coops to argue that this phenomenon can also
   be found outside formal decision-making forums, in menial and quotidian
   tasks undertaken for the preservation and maintenance of the
   organization. Using the political theory of Mary Parker Follett, we
   suggest that involvement in practical concrete activities is an
   overlooked but significant element of democratic life. Residents of the
   coops we studied grew `power-with' by joining others in accomplishing
   everyday tasks, such as blowing snow, gardening, or fixing shelves, and
   this collective power made them feel responsible for the organization
   they were a part of. Broadening our understanding of political
   participation to include those practical activities could be useful in
   assessing and devising plans for participatory reforms in small-scale
   local democracies, but also possibly at a larger scale that would
   produce the benefits of participation without requiring individuals to
   overly engage in demanding and complex procedures.},

   in Central Europe},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 4},
Abstract = {Pernicious polarization is an antagonistic Us versus Them division,
   where the other group is perceived as an existential threat. It is often
   intertwined with the erosion of democratic norms and institutions.
   Although studies on polarization abound, there are still some blind
   spots to be filled. Our contribution is the focus on the mesolevel of
   civil society and the theoretical development of (de) polarization
   mechanisms at this level. Empirically, we study think tanks, a special
   type of civil society organization, in the context of democratic
   backsliding in Hungary and Poland. The analysis is based on 53
   interviews with Hungarian and Polish think tankers conducted between
   2020 and 2022. We contend that through a shift in perceptions of Us,
   Them, and the middle ground, think tanks contribute to both polarization
   and depolarization. Rather than being passive receptors of polarization
   dynamics, we showcase think tanks' agentic roles as they emerge through
   these three mechanisms and through think tanks resorting to specific
   patterns of discourse and interactions.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how Members of the European Parliament (MEPs)
   allo-cate resources between their parliamentary and constituency work,
   focusing on their staffing decisions. Specifically, it examines the
   distribution of MEPs' staff between accredited assistants, based in the
   European Parliament (EP), and local staff working in their constituency.
   The study seeks to explain why some MEPs allocate a larger share of
   their staff to constituency work compared to others by testing several
   hypotheses related to the individual characteristics of MEPs while
   controlling for variations across Member States. Using a newly developed
   data-base with data on MEP assistants at three points during the 9th EP,
   the analysis reveals that Member State differences do not solely explain
   the variation in staff distribution. While there is no evidence that
   staff allocation is driven by strategic considerations to secure
   re-election, it depends significantly on their ideology and past
   political experience},

Month = {2024 OCT 30},
Abstract = {Although the Northern Nigerian state of Kaduna has the second highest
   incidence of violent conflicts among Nigeria's 36 states, the population
   generally reports a low level of expected victimization. A large-N
   survey conducted in the state in 2021 showed that 65\% of the population
   believe they are unlikely to be directly affected by violent conflict in
   the future. This is surprising, given that 42\% of respondents
   experienced at least 10 conflict incidents within a 10 km radius around
   their dwellings between 1997 and 2020. Ordered logit regressions reveal
   that the more individuals are exposed to conflict, the less worried they
   are about getting victimized. The negative correlation between violent
   conflict and expected victimization might be due to the existential
   threat posed by violent conflict, which prompts people to rely more
   heavily on their ethnoreligious kinship ties for both material and
   non-material support. This, in turn, attenuates their fear of
   victimization.},

   change. However, identifying a socialization effect is difficult due to
   self-selection mechanisms and limitations in data availability. This
   article empirically investigates the underlying peer socialization by
   employing a longitudinal network study of undergraduate students in
   Swedish and Finnish top-ranked business schools (N = 2651). The study
   tests the hypotheses that (1) attitudes within a cohort converge over
   time, and (2) socially embedded students experience more attitudinal
   change during their studies than students who do not engage with their
   peers. The paper leverages the Covid-19 pandemic as an exogenous shock
   that severely affected the networking dynamics of specific cohorts since
   it moved their education off campus. It is thereby among the first
   studies to directly test the relationship between socializing behaviors
   within higher education and political attitudes using both subjective
   and objective measurements. Contrary to previous conjectures, the
   findings challenge a general socialization mechanism to foster political
   attitudes. Instead, they point toward the importance of self-selection
   mechanisms in studies of higher education and for the specific student
   composition.},

Abstract = {How does the decline of traditional news outlets affect political
   polarization? We provide novel evidence on this question by examining
   the link between local newspaper exits, media consumption, and electoral
   behaviour in a multiparty setting. Our empirical analysis combines a
   unique panel of all German local newspapers between 1980 and 2009,
   electoral returns, and an annual media consumption survey of more than
   670,000 respondents. Using a difference-in-differences design, we
   demonstrate that local newspaper exits increase electoral polarization.
   Additional analysis points to changes in media consumption as the
   underlying mechanism driving this result: following local news exits,
   consumers substitute local news with national tabloid news. Our findings
   extend prior results in the US context to a multiparty setting and shed
   new light on the causal chain running from changing local news
   landscapes to electoral behaviour.},

Abstract = {Since the advent of mass media, `going public' has been a key tool in
   the strategic inventory of presidents seeking to promote their policies
   to politicians and the public. Over the last decade, social media has
   offered presidents and their office with a new platform to address the
   nation directly without relying on traditional media gatekeepers.
   Nevertheless, both `going public' strategies and presidents' use of
   social media have almost exclusively been researched in the context of
   the presidential systems. The aim of this article is to extend research
   and offer the first systematic study of presidential Twitter use in
   European semi-presidential systems. We conceptualise presidential
   Twitter use as a form of presidential activism that is complementary to
   the use of formal powers or informal attempts to influence policy.
   Whereas the latter are driven by institutional or partisan conflict,
   going public strategies and presidential Twitter use primarily address
   societal concerns and, hence, are motivated by contextual factors
   outside the core realm of party politics. Instead, we should expect
   social conflict and societal grievances to determine demand and supply
   of presidential Twitter use. We test our propositions using a new
   dataset of tweets by presidents in European semi-presidential systems
   2010-2020.},

Abstract = {Russia's authorities allow for gradual increase in women's legislative
   representation, but retreat from legislating policies that address
   women's concerns. This article relates the discrepancy between two kinds
   of women's representation in Russia - substantive and descriptive - to
   the prevalence of the public sector in legislative recruitment. Using a
   comprehensive set of data on women's representation in the regional
   legislatures of Russia, the study demonstrates that public sector
   affiliation is the strongest predictor of women's legislative
   recruitment by the country's pro-government party, and that female
   legislators, in comparison to male legislators, are less likely to
   pursue long-term political careers.},

Abstract = {We assess gender gaps in attitudes to several important and distinct
   policy areas, including economic left-right issues, gender equality,
   immigration, environmentalism and traditional `moral issues'. Drawing on
   comprehensive survey data from 14 established democracies in Western
   Europe, we document that women have more progressive attitudes than men
   do on all the five attitudinal dimensions that we consider. These
   patterns are similar (albeit not identical) across West European
   countries, despite cross-country differences in political cultures and
   systems. We also elaborate on potential implications of our findings for
   other political outcomes of interest, including voting behaviour and the
   functioning of representative democracy, and point to avenues for future
   research in detailing the mechanisms that contribute to the observed
   gender gaps.},

Abstract = {Before their 2024 bruising defeat, the Conservative Party had been in
   power for more than a decade, during which it had to deal with many
   exogeneous and endogenous crises. Meanwhile, the Conservatives have yet
   managed to win three general elections, making unprecedented gains in
   2019. We argue that communication and leadership were key in
   establishing power relations and, within the theoretical framework of
   Seeger and Sellnow's ``crisis narratives{''} and Boin and t'Hart's
   ``Public leadership in times of crisis{''}, we propose to analyse
   critically the main narratives that Conservative Prime Ministers have
   dwelt on to secure their hold on power.},

Title = {Neoliberal means to dirigiste ends: explaining the French government's
   use of Heroic Industrial Policy Discourse (HIPD) in EU politics},

Abstract = {Observers in academia and media alike have observed a return of `French
   ideas' in the European Union (EU), equated with the legacy of dirigisme.
   However, there has been relatively little interest in why economic
   voluntarism remained so resilient in French government discourse. After
   all, the country has been a central actor in the making of embedded
   neoliberalism in Europe and implemented market reforms no less profound
   than in other member states. French material interests only provide a
   partial explanation for this discursive resilience. This paper builds on
   discursive institutionalism to explain how dirigiste communicative
   discourse and neoliberal coordinative discourse interact and jointly
   shape the French government's input into EU politics. Using secondary
   literature and original empirical material based on the uses of the
   `European sovereignty' concept between 1995 and 2017, I show that Heroic
   Industrial Policy Discourse is used to justify the extension of
   (EU-driven) market logics into all spheres of public action in France on
   the grounds that this will, at an indeterminate future, lead to the
   implementation of dirigisme on a grander scale.},

Abstract = {Why do some sub-state governments establish offices abroad for
   international economic development, while others do not? This article
   focuses on the paradiplomatic policy of sub-state government
   internationalization (SGI) that allows sub-state governments to build
   international networks abroad to promote greater trade, investment, and
   tourism within their borders. Moving away from autonomy-focused
   explanations, this article develops three capacity-based hypotheses
   about the adoption and size of sub-state internationalization. Using an
   original dataset of the 517 sub-state governments within the
   Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the
   analysis reveals that revenue, human capital, and information capacities
   are significant in predicting SGI. These findings help paint a novel
   picture of sub-state internationalization in the globalized economy,
   showcasing a new methodological and theoretical approach for the study
   of paradiplomacy and sub-state decision-making.},

Abstract = {The American state was a republic of patrons and clients throughout the
   Long Nineteenth Century. Unequal ties of hierarchy and reciprocity went
   far beyond the partisan administration and electioneering that we
   associate with the spoils system. As a form of ``belated feudalism,{''}
   clientelism proved resilient because it was a familial property relation
   embedded within a diverse and changing society. Officeholding politics
   subsumed a host of racialized and gendered dependents-White men of lower
   status, women, children, and the enslaved-into the penumbra of the
   state, which itself was governed via the extended party household. What
   elements of patron-client relations endured or changed from the colonial
   inheritance until the New Deal? This article reinterprets the republic's
   classical age, first, by exploring the origins of party patrimonialism,
   and then, by examining the dynamics of officeholding political economy
   and the rise of markets for patronage. Political rule before the New
   Deal had a different orientation. Clientelism fused older lineages of
   dependence with the kind of profit-seeking exchanges typical of the
   burgeoning capitalist economy. It was this mixed state, at once
   patrimonial and capitalist, that proved so difficult to reform at the
   turn of the twentieth century.},

Abstract = {Sentiment analysis is one of the most widely used text analysis methods
   in social science. Recent advancements with large language models have
   made it more accurate and accessible than ever, allowing researchers to
   classify text with only a plain English prompt. However, ``sentiment{''}
   entails a wide variety of concepts depending on the domain and tools
   used. It has been used to mean emotion, opinions, market movements, or
   simply a general ``good-bad{''} dimension. This raises a question: What
   exactly are language models doing when prompted to label documents by
   sentiment? This paper first overviews how sentiment is defined across
   different contexts, highlighting that it is a confounded measurement
   construct that entails multiple concepts, particularly emotional valence
   and opinion, without disentangling them. I then test three language
   models across two data sets with prompts requesting sentiment, valence,
   and stance classification. I find that language models generally
   understand sentiment in terms of emotional valence rather than opinion.
   I find that classification generally improves when researchers more
   precisely specify their dimension, but that even when classification
   metrics are similar the different prompts are biased in different ways.
   I conclude by encouraging researchers to move beyond sentiment when
   feasible and use more precise measurement constructs.},

Abstract = {Climate justice movements and scholars have established that
   marginalized communities, including people of color, Indigenous Peoples,
   women, and the Global South, are most vulnerable to climate change.
   Recently, scholars also have established that the climate crisis places
   LGBTQ+ communities in precarious positions. Yet, we know little about
   how LGBTQ+ activists practice climate justice and build political
   bridges between LGBTQ+ and climate justice movements. By analyzing queer
   climate activism, I find that bridging the US climate and LGBTQ+
   movements share three elements: (1) vulnerability and intersectional
   analysis, (2) survival and resilience, and (3) play. In bridging the
   movements, activists ``queer{''} climate justice by spatially shifting
   on what grounds or issues to fight, prefiguring worlds not yet in
   existence on a larger scale, and reimagining how to perform climate
   activism.},

Abstract = {Starting from the observation that the deterioration of democratic
   communication is a political problem that requires individual and
   collective, private and public actions, I first defend a baseline duty
   to avoid using expressions that conventionally show a disrespectful
   attitude toward targeted groups. Then I develop a set of guidelines that
   can guide political theorists in distributing additional duties that
   respect the situated agency of different individuals. I propose two
   normative constraints ({''}capacity to act{''} and ``influence{''}) that
   should influence how theorists assign duties. Then I present three
   criteria ({''}pointless,{''} ``antisocial,{''} and ``lawfulness{''}) to
   specify the content in a context-sensitive way.},

Abstract = {Kevin Munger argues that, when an agnostic approach is applied to social
   scientific inquiry, the goal of prediction to new settings is
   generically impossible. We aim to situate Munger's critique in a broader
   scientific and philosophical literature and to point to ways in which
   gnosis can and, in some circumstances, must be used to facilitate the
   accumulation of knowledge. We question some of the premises of Munger's
   arguments, such as the definition of statistical agnosticism and the
   characterization of knowledge. We further emphasize the important role
   of microfoundations and particularism in the social sciences. We assert
   that Munger's conclusions may be overly pessimistic as they relate to
   practice in the field.},

Abstract = {Research on propaganda often focuses on strategies that autocrats can
   use to persuade skeptical citizens. I outline a different function of
   propaganda-reinforcing regime support and building trust through
   identity-consistent messages. Such affirmation propaganda results in
   more positive perceptions of propaganda outlets and skepticism about
   independent media. I test this argument using three studies in Russia.
   In two randomized experiments, I demonstrate that pro-regime citizens
   trust reports from state media more than reports from independent media;
   however, state media lose trust if they send more critical messages.
   Additional survey evidence suggests that regime supporters often find
   state media accurate despite recognizing the pro-government bias of
   these outlets. My analysis suggests that autocrats are more constrained
   by public opinion than previously thought. It also helps to better
   understand the role of persuasion and censorship in authoritarian
   regimes, and it highlights that independent media have limited power to
   challenge authoritarian rule.},

Title = {The economic divide that isn't: A comparative study on economic hardship
   and affective polarisation},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article examines the role of economic hardship in contributing to
   our understanding of the causes of affective polarisation - that is, the
   animosity between partisan groups. Evidence suggests that a variety of
   political attitudes and behaviours are influenced by economic hardship,
   but the relationship between individual economic hardship and affective
   polarisation has not yet been demonstrated. Thus, the purpose of this
   study is to investigate whether individuals facing economic insecurities
   are more affectively polarised. This study leverages two novel surveys,
   the first conducted in 11 European countries (N = 12,000), the second in
   Belgium and the Netherlands (N = 2174). Both contain individual-level
   measurements of economic hardship novel to the field of affective
   polarisation. Whereas the first allows for making generalisable claims
   across European multiparty systems, the second contains a more thorough
   operationalisation of the central concepts. The paper finds little to no
   evidence to support the existence of a link between economic hardship
   and affective polarisation. Across countries, objective and subjective
   measures of economic hardship are not linked to affective polarisation,
   neither when based on employment or financial status. Future research
   should now examine whether these cross-sectional findings are supported
   by longitudinal or experimental evidence.},

Title = {Individual Electoral Competitiveness: Undecided voters, complex choice
   environments and lower turnout},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {92},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The number of citizens that are undecided in their vote choice has risen
   in Western democracies. Polling in Britain shows that a significant
   proportion of the population do not know who they will vote for. Against
   a backdrop of partisan dealignment and party system fragmentation, there
   are more parties on the ballot and more citizens `free to choose'.
   Partisanship continues to be important for voting and lacking an
   identity is a predictor of aggregate voter volatility. A growing
   literature conceptualises this availability of voters as
   individual-level electoral competitiveness, stating that undecided
   citizens are subject to high levels of competition for their vote. I use
   this framework and apply theory from the decisionmaking literature to
   offer why these conditions may depress turnout. I construct a measure of
   undecided voters who are `in competition' and show that this accounts
   for 40\% of the British Election Study Internet Panel respondents. I
   demonstrate that those who are in competition are less likely to vote.
   They are more often those without a partisan identity and those who pay
   less attention to politics, but being in competition is not related to
   constituency marginality. The results help explain a key determinant of
   abstention in British elections and suggest low levels of participation
   may be due to complex choice environments and citizen indecision.
   However, they provide a positive outlook for pluralistic democracy as
   voters do deliberate between the party perspectives on offer.},

Abstract = {A key lesson of the coronavirus pandemic was the importance for
   pro-social behaviour of popular trust in key information sources. Yet
   existing studies rarely consider the role of people's trust in a range
   of different information sources, and the relationship between such
   trust and particular attitudes and behaviours among individuals. This
   study goes beyond the general mantra that `trust matters' and explores
   more specific effects, relating to trust in particular actors and for
   particular outcomes. Based on a survey fielded on a representative
   sample of the British population conducted towards the end of the
   pandemic, we find evidence that people's coronavirus attitudes and
   behaviours are particularly related to their trust in scientific experts
   and, in some cases, to their trust in local councils. However, trust in
   these actors is not uniformly associated with people's coronavirus
   beliefs and actions. This suggests that the link between people's trust
   and their pro-social attitudes and behaviours is often specific rather
   than general. The results hold important implications for the design of
   effective public communication strategies in the event of any future
   health emergency.},

Abstract = {This study examines the motivations of party activists in Ukraine, a
   country known for clientelistic and oligarch-led political parties. It
   investigates whether these parties attract individuals seeking purposive
   incentives and explores factors associated with such motivation. Data
   were collected from surveys of approximately 200 party activists across
   three major Ukrainian cities during the 2019 Parliamentary Elections.
   The analysis reveals that purposive motivation is more prevalent among
   party activists than previously thought. Older activists and formal
   party members demonstrate higher levels of purposive motivation compared
   to their younger and non-member counterparts, while the study finds no
   positive correlation between ideological extremism and purposive
   motivation. These findings challenge the conventional assumption of
   party activists as hired ``mercenarie{''} in volatile party systems and
   extend the scope of party membership and activism research beyond
   established Western democracies.},

Abstract = {Partisan polarization on ``culture war{''} issues has become a defining
   feature of contemporary American politics. This was not always the case;
   for the first two-thirds of the twentieth century, social issues such as
   abortion and LGBTQ rights played no role in politics. Where and when did
   the partisan divide begin? Did the initiative come from state or
   national parties? Was there a critical moment, or was position change
   incremental? We have constructed an original database of nearly 2,000
   state party platforms from 1960 to 2018. These platforms allow us to
   trace position-taking on these issues and generate estimates of platform
   ideology. By the time national parties took positions, we show, they
   lagged state-level position-taking. Contrary to long-held assumptions,
   we show that state party system polarization did not occur around any
   critical moment but rather was incremental.},

Pages = {668-687},

Abstract = {This paper explores the reasons why states occasionally do not adhere to
   the behavioural expectations as prescribed by their foreign policy
   master roles. To that end, it proposes four potential drivers for such
   `role violations', namely: exogenous pressure, political survival, lack
   of issue salience and ensuing bureaucratic decision-making, and unclear
   role demands in ambiguous decision contexts. Empirically, the paper
   examines the plausibility of those drivers for the case of Germany's
   abstention in the United Nations Security Council vote on resolution
   1973 on Libya. It suggests that in that particular case considerations
   of political survival made civilian power Germany act out of character.},

Abstract = {In a time of heightened affective and negative partisanship, we examine
   the intra-elite party dynamics underlying insulting partisan rhetoric.
   Our focus is on Republicans' reference to their partisan opponents as
   the ``Democrat Party,{''} an ungrammatical mislabeling intended as a
   slur. We show that this usage, while not new, has exploded in recent
   years. This increase comes at the same time as significant change within
   the Republican Party. We argue that the tumultuous changes ushered in by
   the 2016 election have created fertile ground for factional turnover and
   enabled the rise of this partisan slur. We further contend that the
   epithet's meaning has subtly shifted, suggesting that performatively
   partisan actors within the party, namely, partisan media, have become
   centralized actors within the Republican network. Using several corpora
   of political communication by Republican politicians and conservative
   media, we document a general rise in mislabelings of the Democrats
   concentrated in 2018-2019. We further show that the adoption of this
   insult by notable Republican elites like Donald Trump is due primarily
   to right-wing media's influence. We conclude with a discussion of the
   normative implications of increasingly partisan media-centric,
   performative politics within the American right.},

Abstract = {There is extensive debate in the literature over the link between threat
   and political attitudes - while some find evidence that threat and
   threat sensitivity lead to political conservatism, others find that the
   effect of threat is more contextual. We contribute to this debate by
   theorizing that the link between threat and politics is based on both
   individual differences and political rhetoric. First, sensitivity about
   personal threats predicts greater concern about political threats as
   well. This issue concern may in turn be directed toward either
   conservatism or liberalism through political rhetoric and elite
   positioning. Using one observational and one experimental survey of
   American adults conducted in 2018 and 2023, we find consistent evidence
   that personal threat sensitivity increases issue concern regardless of
   the specific issue or its partisan ownership, and independent of
   partisanship or ideology. This increased issue concern does not produce
   a uniformly conservative shift - rather, an increase in concern about
   ``Republican{''} issues leads to greater preference for Republican
   candidates, and vice versa for Democrats. The relationship between
   threat sensitivity and political attitudes is thus best understood as a
   contextual one.},

Abstract = {This article explores what Alexis de Tocqueville understood to be the
   value of the church in the local democracies of the French old order. In
   Ancien R \& eacute;gime, Tocqueville claims that a network of local
   parish churches, led by public-spirited clergymen, developed a system of
   self-governance, complete with public assemblies, reserved powers, and a
   sense of civic duty. Thus, the Tocquevillian township one might be
   tempted to presume unique to New England appears again in the French
   feudal order as a seed of political freedom, but one whose liberty
   depends on the civic education of the feudal Catholic Church. To
   illuminate this view, the article examines two services Tocqueville's
   French church offered: instilling political doctrines on which democracy
   relies, and encouraging, hosting, and protecting public forums. While
   the article may primarily aid Tocqueville's interpreters, it also aims
   to serve those grappling with the healthy relationship between local
   democracies and religious organizations.},

Abstract = {This contribution is tackling: a) the original acceptance of the term <<
   cyberspace >> in the literature and in the techno-sciences related to
   HEI (first and second paragraph); b) its inevitable ramifications in the
   political/strategical domain. The basic assumption of the analysis is
   that: there are two basic ways in which cyberspace is conceptualized.
   The first way excludes physical infrastructures from its definitions,
   whereas the second includes them to various degrees. In the former
   definition, << cyberspace >> emerges just as a space between the
   hardware components of computer networks, where interaction happens, a
   place that is fundamentally different from physical reality. The latter
   definition, indeed, takes into account different layers and abstractions
   of information riding on a physical sheet of hardware, with various and
   effective types of entanglements between abstractions and physical
   components/contexts. This specific acceptance is to be privileged here
   (third and fourth paragraph). Thus, in the present contribution <<
   cyberspace >> is seen as comprising both a material and a virtual realm,
   in a very peculiar way, producing new combinations of material elements
   (infrastructures, wires, hardware) and abstract meanings, with a huge
   impact on politics. This is crucial for the interdisciplinary debate on
   which kind of political imagination is suited for the cyber domain.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},

Abstract = {This article takes a systematic approach to unpack how pro-government
   mass action emerges in autocracies. Both the channels and triggers of
   pro-regime mass action are considered using a large-n dataset of mass
   mobilization in autocracies between 2003 and 2017. We test quantitively
   how mass mobilization can occur in autocracies - through party elites
   and regime-affiliated organizations - and find stronger evidence for the
   role of elites in enabling pro-government mass action through their use
   of clientelistic linkages with constituents. However, contrary to
   expectation, in the aftermath of a particular trigger (i.e.,
   anti-government protests) the likelihood of pro-government mobilization
   is highest when regime-affiliated organizations are weak or nonexistent.
   The magnitude of this effect is higher for violent anti-government
   opposition, as compared to nonviolent dissent, suggesting that violent
   anti-government opposition tactics tend to generate pro-government
   mobilization as a form of backlash against the violence and are more
   polarizing in autocratic civil societies.},

Title = {Spirited away: Access to alcohol and support for the populist radical
   right},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {91},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Does the availability of alcohol influence support for radical
   right-wing parties, and if so, why? Drawing parallels to the UK, where
   pub closures led to increased support for UKIP, this study investigates
   similar trends observed in Sweden. Utilizing a novel dataset of over
   50,000 alcohol-serving permits and electoral data from 2002 to 2018, the
   study finds that a reduction in permits is associated with a 3.7\%
   increase in support for the Sweden Democrats (SD). To explain this, it
   is argued that bar closures politicize alcohol regulation and serve as a
   symbolic issue linked to the populist radical right. Survey data from
   over 20,000 respondents reveal that individuals in municipalities with a
   decreasing number of permits are more likely to support alcohol
   deregulation policies, and these voters become more likely to support
   SD. These findings underscore how perceptions of government
   overregulation drive support for radical right-wing parties.},

Abstract = {Despite the reliance of the government on technology firms to implement
   the digital transformation, little systematic analysis has investigated
   how governments select their partners. By tracing the evolution of
   China's digitalization, we found that partner selection was mainly
   affected by considerations of project performance, ICT innovations, and
   perceived security risks. In recent years, local governments like
   Zhejiang have faced the ``impossible trinity{''} issue when partnering
   with private technology firms, due to the rising concerns about security
   risks. The Zhejiang government and a private tech titan found a middle
   ground by collaboratively forming a new state-owned special-purpose
   vehicle (SO-SPV) to address this issue. Although the emergence of
   SO-SPVs has legitimized and strengthened public-private collaboration,
   it may also reduce its capacity regarding ICT innovation and so bestow
   on technology firms greater political influence. This research offers
   insights into the changing dynamics of state-business relationships in
   the digital era.},

Abstract = {For 25 years following the end of the Cold War, Western navies focused
   on operating in littorals and projecting power from sea to land. This
   began to change with the rise of near-peer rivals and the development of
   highly sophisticated anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) technologies.
   Nonetheless, expeditionary operations have remained a core business for
   most navies. Richard Dunley argues that the democratisation of these
   A2/AD technologies, as conflicts in the Red and Black Seas have
   highlighted, will significantly restrict the ability of navies to
   continue operating in this way, even against smaller powers. This will
   lead to the end of the second golden age of transoceanic navies.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {91},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The rules by which parties select their candidates are important, not
   only because they determine the policy and leaders of a party. Candidate
   selection, the identity of those taking the final decision
   (selectorate), has been found to impact the behavior of parliamentarians
   around the world (e.g. Preece, 2014; Sieberer, 2006). However, there is
   disagreement among scholars as to which kind of effect we can expect,
   under which conditions and why. In light of an interesting, previously
   unstudied case - Switzerland - and on the basis of rich data relating to
   many different political activities we re-investigate the question of
   how candidate selection affects the political behavior. Our results
   indicate that in highly personalized political systems like the Swiss,
   MPs selected by a more inclusive selectorate do not differ significantly
   from other MPs in party loyalty but are more likely to engage in some
   activities that are more visible to their cantonal selectorate.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the reintegration of tacit skills among Polish
   and Lithuanian migrants returning from the UK amid Brexit and the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Using a CAWI survey of 740 returnees, it explores the
   application of tacit skills acquired abroad in their origin countries'
   labor markets. The research reveals the challenges return migrants face
   in utilizing their overseas-acquired skills, influenced by local labor
   market structures, employers' attitudes, and individual experiences. The
   findings contribute to understanding the role of international migration
   in skill distribution and labor market dynamics, focusing on the
   personal and economic reintegration of return migrants.},

Abstract = {Studies have shown that citizens from minoritized groups, including
   women and people of color, tend to feel better represented by
   politicians who share their identity, often translating into electoral
   support. Is this also the case for disabled people, one of the largest
   yet often ignored minority groups in our societies? Analyses of data
   from a conjoint survey experiment with 6,000 respondents in the UK and
   US show that disabled people indeed feel better represented by disabled
   candidates. This representational link does not require a sense of group
   identity and is only partly explained by perceptions of shared policy
   preferences. The study also reveals that non-disabled people feel better
   represented by non-disabled candidates. The findings highlight the
   relevance of disability as a political identity, bolstering calls for
   more disabled people in politics, and might help explain the disability
   gaps in political trust and participation.},

Abstract = {This article, through an anthropological lens inspired by Anthony Leeds'
   concept of locality, examines the interplay between urban governance and
   autocratization in Shanghai's gated communities during the COVID-19
   pandemic. As strategic microcosms within China's cities, these urban
   spaces are analysed as distinct human-geographical units to reveal the
   intricacies of multilevel governance within China's authoritarian
   framework. Drawing on a multifaced ethnographic approach, including
   online and offline ethnographic research and secondary data analysis,
   the paper explores how gated communities act as potential enclaves for
   democratic practices, fostering public participation amidst strong state
   control. The findings highlight the pivotal role of urban fabric in
   shaping political dynamics, positioning gated communities as key sites
   for understanding deepening autocratization processes in urban China.},

Title = {The right to dream: Martin Luther King Jr.'s pragmatist argument for
   racial progress},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 22},
Abstract = {Do Americans have a right to believe that the country is making racial
   progress? Conservatives sometimes answer yes and argue that the country
   is achieving Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of a color-blind society.
   Afropessimists answer no and point to the continuing problems of police
   terror, mass incarceration, and poverty among Black Americans. This
   article unearths King's 1952 term paper on the pragmatists to reveal an
   early engagement with William James' notion of the will to believe. The
   article interprets King as articulating a right to dream of a just and
   loving world to maximize the chance of the community actualizing it. The
   conclusion argues that the idea of a right to dream helps people become
   energized rather than despondent in the aftermath of the Supreme Court
   case prohibiting race-conscious college admissions.},

Abstract = {The rise of authoritarian-style strong leaders in democracies has
   prompted scholars to question the change in public support for
   democracy. However, existing studies have often misunderstood this shift
   by erroneously equating support for authoritarian strong leaders with a
   rejection of democracy. They thus fail to recognize the growing public
   support for both, a conception of democracy termed guardianship
   democracy. This conception reconceptualizes democracy, viewing strong
   leaders as necessary for the effective functioning of democracy. By
   differentiating these two distinct supports for authoritarian-style
   strong leadership in democracies - authoritarianism and guardianship
   democracy, we reexamine the impact of factors believed to increase
   public support for authoritarian leadership. Our analysis, utilizing
   data from the World Values Survey spanning from Wave 3 to Wave 7,
   reveals that authoritarianism and guardianship democracy supporters
   share several common factors that bolster their political convictions.
   However, two notable differences emerge. First, higher confidence in the
   elected government and political parties is only associated with
   guardianship democracy supporters. Second, lower trust in parliament is
   associated with authoritarianism supporters, but not with guardianship
   democracy supporters.},

Abstract = {The new government faces an urgent challenge: revitalising the UK's
   crumbling public services without major increases in public spending.
   While technological change holds promise, UK digital government
   initiatives have failed to reach their full potential over the past
   twenty-five years. This article argues that the latest generation of
   `data-intensive' technologies, including data science and AI, can
   succeed where past efforts have faltered. We provide a roadmap for how
   to harness the power of recent technologies for a more productive and
   equitable public sector, and pinpoint the organisational changes
   necessary to develop progressive, technologically enhanced public
   services.},

Abstract = {Do rural Americans trust the government less than non-rural Americans?
   In an era of declining trust in government and mounting geographic
   polarization, this research examines the relationship between geography,
   identity, and attitudes of political trust in the United States. Using
   national survey data from the 2016 and 2020 American National Election
   Studies time series surveys, this quantitative analysis tests hypotheses
   that rurality in the context of place and place-based identity is
   associated with lower trust in the federal government. Overall, the
   results show that both living in and identifying with more rural areas
   corresponds with decreased government trust, regardless of the political
   party of the incumbent president. These findings contribute to the
   understanding of America's urban-rural political divide and suggest
   significant implications for both partisan leaders and policymakers.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the Scandinavian states' staffing of middle and
   senior-ranking positions within the United Nations (UN)-system, in
   comparison to other members of the Organization of Economic Cooperation
   and Development (OECD). It is true that the Scandinavian states are
   overrepresented per the size of their population in both staffing
   categories; however, when it comes to a comparison of financial
   contributions to the UN regular budget, the three states are
   underrepresented compared to the rest of the OECD in staffing funded by
   that mechanism. Yet, the strong reputation of the Scandinavian states
   and their practitioners has still enabled them to disproportionately
   staff senior UN positions. To explain this, this paper utilises Pierre
   Bourdieu's concepts of capital, field, and habitus to explain how the
   three states' reputation within the UN-system gives them an advantage in
   staffing senior positions.},

Abstract = {Pad Thai, an innovation of Chinese kway teow through Thai-ization that
   became an iconic national dish of Thailand, played a significant role in
   shaping national identity and constructing the country's national image.
   This study explored the relationship between nationalist policies and
   the localization of kway teow during the Phibunsongkhram government
   (1938-1944), which contributed to the popularity of kway teow in
   Thailand's lower class in terms of both production and consumption. The
   examination of government policies and recipes revealed that Thais
   infused their emotions and the sense of national identity into the
   production and consumption of kway teow, thereby enhancing the bond
   between individuals and the nation and laying a more solid base for the
   implementation of nationalist policies. The innovation of Pad Thai was
   one such nationalist policy that was disseminated top-down by the
   Phibunsongkhram government, making it a national food of Thailand by
   highlighting its Thai characteristics and including it in its National
   Nutrition Project. However, Pad Thai was not purely a national Thai
   dish; rather, it was one that existed in Thais' imagination. In
   revealing the nature of national cuisine and its importance in
   nation-building, this study's findings contribute to the significant
   role of localizing Chinese food in Thai nation-building.},

Abstract = {This article examines how socialist experts were integrated into the
   entrenched global agenda of demographic security. The interplay of
   supranational and national priorities of reproductive politics is
   examined through three progressively developing practices: (1) research
   on ``congenital malformations{''} as an argument for surveillance over
   women since the mid-1950s; (2) involvement of socialist experts in
   global debates regarding reproductive responsibility in the 1960s; and
   (3) revision of approaches to the ``right to life{''} during the 1970s
   and 1980s. The layering and conversion of these practices explains the
   role of reproductive injustice in extensive segregation against people
   with disabilities in post-socialist countries.},

Abstract = {This article analyses Tunisian President Kais Saied's abuse of
   counterterrorism law and his culpability in the country's democratic
   backsliding. Following his election in 2019, Saied, with a split
   government and a growing economic and political crisis, took extreme
   measures to end the political deadlock, including dissolving the
   country's parliament and claiming emergency powers in 2021. We argue
   that Saied has moved beyond making temporary moves to ensure political
   stability and is now seeking to use the country's counterterrorism law
   as both his ``weapon and shield,{''} conducting a targeted arrest
   campaign against opposition figures, and solidifying his authoritarian
   control of Tunisia. The arrest campaign, conducted primarily under the
   2015 counterterrorism law, commenced in early 2023 and has included
   several prominent political figures in Tunisia. The charges, often
   stemming from an offender's political statements, were framed as
   violations of the counterterrorism law, and were therefore justified to
   stem the tide of extremism and terrorism in Tunisia. Such legal abuse
   has allowed Saied to present his authoritarian actions as within the
   limits of the rule of law, a common approach for entrenched
   authoritarians. The analysis of arrest patterns suggests that a
   continued abuse of the counterterrorism law will eventually erode
   Tunisia's nascent democracy.},

Abstract = {I draw together theories of partisan polarization and motivated
   reasoning, which suggest that partisanship shapes information
   processing, and theories of accountability, which argue voters hold
   elected officials accountable through promise fulfillment. Here, I ask
   how partisanship influences voter understanding of promise fulfillment
   and accountability and if voters assess promises through a partisan
   lens. Two original survey experiments test how respondents react to
   promise fulfillment on the issues of immigration and human trafficking.
   I demonstrate that co-partisans differentiate between kept and broken
   promises, but out-partisans do not. Despite partisan differences,
   respondents evaluate promise-keeping when asked about accountability but
   not when asked about approval. Thus, even when voters recognize broken
   promises, accountability is influenced by partisanship. Immigration, a
   more polarized issue, is more likely to prime a partisan response than
   human trafficking, a less polarized issue. Future work must account for
   partisanship in accountability and what this means for our understanding
   of fundamental democratic principles.},

Abstract = {This research note explores variation in how political parties and
   presidents in Latin America responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. Relying
   on the Chapel Hill Expert Survey-Latin America (CHES-LA), we argue that
   preferences regarding the trade-off between virus containment and
   maintaining an open economy were shaped by the ideological positions of
   presidents and parties, particularly for more programmatic ones. This is
   largely consistent with findings in other world regions. Yet, beyond
   ideological orientation, populism, also had an important - though
   heterogeneous - effect on response preferences, with non-populists,
   particularly highly programmatic ones, more consistently supporting
   virus containment. In addition, both incumbents and more populist
   presidents and parties favoured further concentration of executive power
   to address the pandemic. These findings provide evidence of the
   importance of understanding how ideology, populism and programmatic
   linkages interact in Latin America's party systems.},

Abstract = {This study displays Twitter's relevance in collecting sentiments and
   evaluating social networks, notably in election processes. This study
   examines 10,000 tweets on the 2022 Philippine presidential election,
   gathered during the key week of May 9-13, 2022, to show Twitter's
   influence in molding the public conversation. The study found the most
   popular hashtags, including \#halalan2022 and \#eleksyon2022,
   highlighting their importance in the digital discussion around the
   election. A thorough social network study established eight key
   communities, demonstrating a strong connection among Filipino netizens
   during electionrelated debates. Among these, noteworthy people such as
   @RexelBartolome and @daywreckoning, as well as the news site @ABSCBNEWS,
   emerged as essential nodes, demonstrating their influence in information
   dissemination. Sentiment analysis of the tweets revealed a mostly
   neutral public mood toward the election, with frequent phrases such as
   ``martial law{''} and ``never again{''} indicating the discourse's
   underlying themes. This study examines Twitter as a valuable instrument
   for political analysis and advocates for a more sophisticated method of
   picking tweets that truly reflect community attitudes. Future studies
   should look beyond pre-election times to provide a complete picture of
   online debate, using Twitter's API for easy data gathering and analysis.
   This study closes a fundamental gap in understanding social media
   dynamics in the Philippines, providing insights for academic and
   practical applications in political communication.},

Abstract = {In the past decade, applying machine learning methods in political
   science has grown in popularity. The increase in data volume and sources
   motivated researchers to turn to these data-driven methods as an
   alternative to classical statistics. Several review papers have proposed
   theoretical typologies for applying machine learning in social sciences.
   We present an overview of how and why machine learning methods are
   actually implemented in the field of political science. The aim of this
   study is to conduct an empirical analysis of the political science
   literature that uses machine learning as a research method. We applied
   the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and
   Meta-Analyses) framework for systematic review studies to systematically
   select 339 articles (1990-2022) from Web of Science and Scopus,
   evaluated their relevance based on a set of inclusion criteria, and
   created a database with the key characteristics. Overall, we observed
   that political scientists have embraced machine learning as empirical
   method based on the increased use in the past 10 years. We found that
   the use of machine learning is the most prevalent in political
   communication and conflict and peace studies, and that topic modeling,
   support vector machine, and random forest are the most used methods. Our
   results indicate that reporting on optimizing machine learning models
   through hyperparameter tuning could be more transparent, and researchers
   should conduct their own benchmarking when choosing the most suitable
   model.},

Title = {How does information affect vote choice in open-list PR systems?
   Evidence from a survey experiment mimicking real-world elections in
   Switzerland},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {List proportional representation with candidate voting can facilitate
   policy representation in multiple dimensions. However, candidates with
   deviating positions may not benefit if cues such as shared
   socio-demographics drive candidate choice instead. Does this use of cues
   reflect a lack of policy-related information or a preference for
   descriptive representation? We study this question in a real-world
   context, using a survey-embedded experiment that emulates actual vote
   choice shortly after the 2019 Swiss elections. We vary the level of
   information on candidates' policy positions in zero, one or two
   dimensions (left-right, environment). Our results show that spatial
   proximity voting increases with better information on the secondary (but
   not the first) dimension, indicating that information can improve the
   alignment of (environmental) policy views between voters and candidates.
   In turn, same-gender and same-age voting slightly decreases when more
   information is available. The preference for local candidates remains
   strong. Our results inform debates regarding citizens' preferences for
   different types of representation and how electoral systems moderate
   their expression.},

Abstract = {Federal systems create complex institutional settings that foster and
   encourage cooperation while also enabling self-serving and even
   opportunistic political behavior. Focusing on parliamentary discourses,
   we argue that political parties can navigate these conflicting
   incentives skillfully, employing a set of five distinct discursive
   strategies that integrate both the need for cooperation and the
   possibility of self-interest. Leveraging a qualitative content analysis
   of 212 German parliamentary debates and 4,524 manually coded statements,
   we demonstrate that the use of these discursive strategies is shaped by
   parties' level of integration into federal institutions. The data reveal
   that parties which are more strongly involved in intergovernmental
   bodies uphold a more cooperative discourse, while refraining from
   confrontational strategies toward federal institutions and actors. We
   also find that the linkage between the vertically integrated party
   system, which incentivizes co-partisans to stick together across levels
   and constituent units, and multiparty coalition governments, counteracts
   federal blame games.},

Abstract = {The nature, measurement, and correlates of the psychological trait of
   authoritarianism have spurred an intense and long-lasting debate in
   political psychology, dating back to the 1950s. This article aims at
   advancing extant knowledge on authoritarianism-measured here by
   child-rearing items-in two ways. First, by investigating the impact of
   authoritarianism on political attitudes and voting, net of individual
   heterogeneity, thus improving causal estimation. Second, by
   investigating the extent to which there exists reverse causality between
   authoritarianism and political attitudes. To do so, we employ a
   longitudinal analysis that covers a timespan of two years using the 2021
   British Election Study Panel. The results suggest that authoritarianism
   in Britain is positively associated with anti-immigration attitudes,
   anti-EU preferences, and opposition to economic redistribution. However,
   when accounting for potential confounding through the inclusion of
   individual fixed effects, we find that authoritarianism retains its
   significant association with anti-immigration preferences alone.
   Further, lagged relations between authoritarianism and immigration
   preferences indicate that within-person changes in immigration attitudes
   precede changes in authoritarianism-not the other way around. Finally,
   the findings indicate that authoritarianism's correlation with vote
   choice is a product of omitted variable bias rather than representing a
   causal relationship.},

Abstract = {This research underscores the key role of ideology in shaping the
   Swedish public's stance towards Israel and Palestine. With the help of a
   survey conducted by the Surveyinstitute in 2020, this paper studies the
   Swedish population's attitudes toward the actions of Israel and
   Palestine in the Israel-Palestine conflict. The findings reveal a
   distinct ideological divide along the left-right scale in the attitudes
   of the Swedish population towards Israel and Palestine's actions. This
   ideological chasm extends to additional actors, such as Sweden, the
   United States, and the EU, in the Israel-Palestine conflict. While
   religion does exert influence, particularly among practicing
   individuals, the study concludes that ideology is the most relevant
   factor in attitudes toward the actions of Israel and Palestina from a
   Swedish perspective.},

Abstract = {On January 6, 2021, the United States came close to scuttling a
   democratic election and installing an illegitimate president. How did
   the United States arrive at this point? An answer must start with Donald
   Trump's authoritarian nature, which had long made him indifferent to or
   contemptuous of constitutional limits on his power-and unable to
   tolerate political outcomes that went against him. But it must also dig
   deeper to examine an international neoliberal political order that,
   since the 1990s, had widened economic inequality, stirred ethnoracial
   resentments, and raised doubts about the capacity of liberal democratic
   regimes to fix what had gone wrong. It must also examine the fateful
   decision by the Republican Party in the decade after George W. Bush's
   presidency to deepen rather than ameliorate the oligarchic tendencies
   present in America's eighteenth-century political system, further
   casting doubt on whether what the nation had long celebrated as
   ``American democracy{''} was worth preserving. A failed political
   economy in combination with an ailing democratic system set the
   preconditions for America's authoritarian turn. With a door to
   authoritarian politics thus opened, Trump lost no time in attempting to
   walk through it. America, and the world, are still dealing with the
   consequences.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research was to identify with whom coffee
   producers in the state of Chiapas share daily issues and topics of
   interest related to the coffee activity. We identified the dynamics of
   social interaction in the coffee sector, the lines of connectivity and
   the absence of contact between actors in the same region and the state.
   This research is based on information from coffee growers of the
   thirteen links managed by the Coffee Institute of the State of Chiapas
   (INCAFECH). INCAFECH extensionists and academics from the Autonomous
   University of Chiapas (UNACH) were used to collect information in
   neighboring areas and to guarantee the sample in the thirteen links. For
   the network analysis, the UCINET software Gephi edition, version 6 and R
   (R) were used. The results show a significant lack of links between
   coffee producers in Chiapas, which reduces the exchange of knowledge,
   know-how and innovations. The conclusion is that there is a need to
   focus agricultural policies on promoting linkages, innovations, and
   access to science and technology.},

Abstract = {In liberal democracies, protest can serve as a trigger for necessary
   policy reforms, but it can also be used by a loud minority to advance
   political goals against the will of the majority. Focusing on such vocal
   protests in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, we investigate the
   following question: How does the location of protest events affect the
   likelihood of political engagement with the protests in a multilevel
   system? Combining social movement literature with studies of issue
   attention and rhetorical responsiveness, we analyze how German members
   of parliaments' (MPs) responses vary using their tweets from the onset
   of the pandemic to the German federal election in September 2021. Using
   quantitative text analysis, we measure rhetorical responsiveness to
   Covid-19 protests and apply multilevel regression analyses and
   difference-in-differences. We find that more protests lead to more
   attention; however, MPs respond most strongly to protests within the
   state they represent. Furthermore, politicians' level within the German
   multilevel system affects their attention to these protests, with MPs
   elected at lower levels of an electoral system responding more to local
   protest events than MPs elected at higher levels. The results highlight
   the importance of the location of protests in attracting political
   attention.},

Abstract = {Silvio Berlusconi emerged as a central figure in Italian politics
   following the collapse of the mass-based party system in the early
   1990s. As a political leader, he introduced significant innovations in
   various fields of politics: new campaign methods; a unique leadership
   style and language; novel coalition strategies, and fresh ideological
   content. This article focuses on one key innovation: the creation of a
   genuinely new political party with an original organizational model.
   Despite the electoral success of Silvio Berlusconi's political parties
   (Forza Italia and later Popolo della Libert \& agrave;), there has been
   little theoretical and especially empirical work devoted to studying
   them. This paper aims to fill that gap by examining the entire
   trajectory of Forza Italia from its inception to the present,
   highlighting its quintessentially charismatic nature in Weberian terms.
   The first section of the article discusses how scholars have variously
   perceived Forza Italia - as a personalized/charismatic party, a
   catch-all party, a franchise party, or a business-firm party. The
   article then considers the factors that have hindered its
   institutionalization. In the final section, the paper critically
   analyses the legacy of Berlusconi's parties for the stability of the
   Italian party system and, more broadly, for the quality of democracy in
   Italy.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},

Abstract = {The party politics literature has shown that parties being mostly
   reliant on state funding (as in most of Europe) is more conducive to
   equal representation than them being mostly reliant on big donors (as in
   the US and UK). But what do citizens think? Relatively little attention
   has been paid to public opinion on party funding. We only know that
   citizens tend to instinctively oppose both ways of funding parties. Yet,
   party funding is not a salient issue except in times of scandal, meaning
   it is an issue on which citizens are ill-informed. In this paper, I test
   what happens when citizens in the UK and Denmark are exposed to
   arguments in support of state party funding, through survey experiments.
   I find that highlighting state funding's ability to reduce party
   reliance on big donors substantially increases support for the policy,
   especially among low trusting Britons.},

Abstract = {The symbiosis between the Israeli army - the IDF - and Israeli society,
   that was forged with the establishment of the State of Israel, is based
   on a model of a ``citizen-soldier{''} military and has always stood as a
   pillar of national strength. Yet there are some who claim that since the
   1990s, carried on the currents of liberalism introduced into Israeli
   society, as well as the effects of social post-modernism, this bond has
   been worn thin. The Israeli government's intention at the beginning of
   2023 to enact laws that would change the balance between the Supreme
   Court and parliament sparked a sweeping protest on part of large swaths
   of Israeli society, a protest culminating when a group of IDF reservists
   declared that they would not report for their next call for reserve duty
   if the reform is enacted. This reality places in question the
   ``citizen-soldier{''} model, and the importance of the connection
   between society and the army for the latter's existence. The present
   study attempts to examine the effects of the deep currents of social
   protest on the relationship between society and the military. It
   included 1,200 participants who filled out an online questionnaire and
   interviews with 30 participants, who shared their opinions on the
   ultimatum presented by the reservist to the Israeli government. The
   findings show that a vast majority of Israelis do not support the use
   that the reservist made of the duty ultimatum; however, a
   considerable/non-negligible minority was in support of this act. An
   in-depth examination of social processes in Israel presents a growing
   conflict between its liberal and traditional-conservative camps, which
   impacts the resilience of Israeli society and might very well compromise
   the national security of the State of Israel.},

Abstract = {This study uses a manually classified tweet sample for examining hate
   speech targeting the ministers of the government of Finland. We use
   logistic regressions to investigate the distribution of hate speech by
   gender, age, party leadership, visibility, and political party, with a
   special focus on gender. Additionally, we divide minister portfolios
   into masculine, neutral, and feminine positions and examine whether a
   minister's gender affects the likelihood of being targeted. Our results
   suggest that male and female ministers are equally likely, on average,
   to be targeted by hate speech. However, this relation is nuanced. First,
   for male ministers, visibility increases the frequency of hate speech.
   For female ministers, the result is the opposite. Moreover, the results
   suggest that women in masculine positions are more likely to face hate
   speech. In addition, men are targeted by hate speech less when they are
   holding a masculine minister portfolio. This suggests that gender roles
   affect hate speech.},

Title = {Does ranked choice Voting Increase voter turnout and mobilization?},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {90},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Many jurisdictions in the United States have recently adopted
   single-winner ranked choice voting (RCV) to replace first-past-the-post
   plurality elections. This study contributes to the literature examining
   the potential consequences of changing to RCV by modeling the
   relationship between electoral systems and voter turnout. We propose
   that RCV may increase turnout by incentivizing increased contacts with
   voters. Previous attempts at assessing the relationship between RCV and
   turnout in the US have been limited by a lack of individual-level
   turnout data measured across all cases where RCV is and is not used. The
   study utilizes large, unique data from administrative voter turnout
   records that overcomes this limitation. We find significant and
   substantially higher probabilities of turnout in places that use RCV,
   and find evidence that campaigns in RCV places have greater incidences
   of direct voter contacting than in similar places that do not use RCV.},

Abstract = {A strong democratic culture is crucial for maintaining a functioning
   democracy. Young people's perspectives on political measures play an
   important role here, as they reveal the tendencies of the population and
   are challenged, especially in times of crisis. The evaluation of
   political measures is closely linked to sociodemographic factors. In
   order to be able to prevent the development of opinions among young
   people that could potentially jeopardise democracy at an early stage, it
   is necessary to obtain a differentiated picture of political attitudes.
   Based on social disintegration theory, in a recent study we analysed
   young people's attitudes to political measures in response to the war in
   Ukraine. We focused on answering the following questions: What types of
   young people can be identified with regard to their assessment of
   political measures in response to the war in Ukraine? What is the
   connection with social disparities? Analyses of the data from our
   representative survey of 3240 participants (aged 16-29 years) point to
   four types: the Diplomatic, the All-rounder, the Militant, and the
   National. Our study also shows that education, gender, and feelings of
   social belonging play an important role in the categorisation of types.
   The results illustrate the challenges of citizenship education in times
   of crisis and can contribute to the development of targeted political
   education programmes to better manage times of crisis.},

Title = {Candidate incentive distributions: How voting methods shape electoral
   incentives},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {90},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We evaluate the tendency for different voting methods to promote
   political compromise and reduce tensions in a society by using computer
   simulations to determine which voters candidates are incentivized to
   appeal to. We find that Instant Runoff Voting incentivizes candidates to
   appeal to a wider range of voters than Plurality Voting, but that it
   leaves candidates far more strongly incentivized to appeal to their base
   than to voters in opposing factions. In contrast, we find that Condorcet
   methods and STAR (Score Then Automatic Runoff) Voting provide the most
   balanced incentives; these differences between voting methods become
   more pronounced with more candidates in the race and less pronounced in
   the presence of strategic voting. We find that the incentives provided
   by Single Transferable Vote to appeal to opposing voters are negligible,
   but that a tweak to the tabulation algorithm makes them substantial.},

Abstract = {Several actors have turned their attention to Africa, and the continent
   is becoming a focal point for international relations. These actors have
   adopted various approaches to improve their relations with African
   countries. This study examines the alternative dimension of rising
   international competition on the continent. The main focus of the study
   is Turkiye's and China's alternative approaches to Africa. Accordingly,
   the study seeks to answer three interrelated questions: What are the
   differences between the traditional and alternative approaches? What are
   the main factors shaping China's and Turkiye's alternative approaches
   toward Africa? What are the similarities in Beijing's and Ankara's
   approaches regarding African countries in practice? As a result, this
   study argues that China and Turkiye present an alternative stance to the
   Western-centered approach for competition in Africa, despite some
   differences in their relations with continental countries.},

   Chilean diplomacy in the face of this act contrary to the Chilean

   framework on which it rests, extensive heuristic and hermeneutical work
   is carried out on Chilean diplomatic documentation. This publication

Abstract = {Energy is foundational to the self-perception of states in the South
   Caucasus. This region's post-Soviet regionalization revolves around the
   ``contract of the century{''} and the export of fossil fuels to Europe.
   T \& uuml;rkiye is the biggest regional energy market, striving to
   balance decarbonization with the objective of maintaining cost-effective
   energy as an independent variable in the development of a globally
   competitive manufacturing hub. Azerbaijan is striving to overcome its
   singular dependence in fossil fuels, while retaining its role as a major
   energy exporter. Central to T \& uuml;rkiye and Azerbaijan's plans is
   Georgia, a country that has largely achieved decarbonization but is
   striving to maintain its role as the region's essential energy transit
   hub. Finally, Armenia continues to prioritize security over connectivity
   in the emerging energy landscape. This paper explores the friction of
   decarbonization with the role of each state in the Caucasus, focusing on
   milestone project investments in renewables.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {209-227},

Abstract = {This article explores the challenges experienced by civil society
   organizations (CSOs) in Croatia, as magnified during the COVID-19
   pandemic, and the strategies they use to mitigate their effects.
   `Organisational resilience' is discussed based on interviews with CSO
   representatives from four fields: contemporary arts and culture,
   environmental protection, women's rights, and educational/youth
   organizations. Three themes are developed: the `normality' of crisis,
   established practices of resilience, and emergent practices of
   resilience. Although the pandemic was experienced as a major disruption,
   there is a lingering sense of persistent crisis in the civil society
   sector which is constituted by many tribulations: wars and economic
   crises, piercing insecurity due to lack of stable funding and an
   antagonistic political climate. Established practices of resilience that
   help organizations stay afloat encapsulate financial ingenuity, caring
   about one's work, and good relations within and outside of the
   organization. Emergent practices include strengthening technology
   infrastructure and use, establishing a trade union for CSO workers, but
   also charging for services. The advocacy role of CSOs seems dimmed and
   their ability to help others comes at the expense of their founding
   values and personal wellbeing. This suggests a `dark' side to
   organizational resilience, a concept frequently used to signal a
   positive ability.},

Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},

Abstract = {Researchers typically define movement parties as political parties that
   attempt to innovate party-political organizing through social movements'
   action repertoire. Apart from being analyzed as a specific type of
   political party, movement parties can also be analyzed as a type of
   framing strategy that actors use to enhance electoral mobilization.
   Although this kind of analysis has previously been undertaken on both
   left-wing and right-wing movement parties, comparisons that would
   juxtapose movement party framing strategies of ideologically diverse
   actors remain scarce. In this paper, we analyze and compare the framing
   strategy of one left-wing and one right-wing electoral actor in
   contemporary Serbia. The paper shows that, in the period of their
   establishment and early activity, the two actors included in the
   analysis used movement party framing in a similar way. At the same time,
   however, it also points to inconsistencies within the frames used by the
   right-wing actor, which relies on the rhetoric of democratic
   participation while simultaneously promoting elitist and corporatist

   thirty democracies},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {90},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Democracy is under threat, while polarization is rising. Empirical
   evidence to understand a possible link between the two is mixed, with
   scholars finding elite polarization increases turnout but decreases
   democratic satisfaction. However, these mixed results span various
   samples and methodologies, including elite surveys and manifestos to
   capture elite polarization data, but they rarely address how citizens
   perceive this polarization. In response, I present a new individual
   -level measure of perceived elite polarization, revealing the
   complexities of individual perceptions of elite polarization that extend
   beyond macro elite polarization and is applicable to any party system.
   The results from applying this new measure confirms that higher
   perceptions of elite polarization can engage citizens but reduce
   satisfaction by testing effects on democratic satisfaction and turnout
   across 34 democracies over 25 years, in addition to panel data in the
   United Kingdom. However, higher perceptions of elite polarization also
   decrease the likelihood of people being simultaneously satisfied with
   democracy and voting. These findings indicate that high perceived elite
   polarization can be detrimental to democracy and emphasizes the
   complexity in individual perceptions of elite polarization, underscoring
   the need for further study.},

Abstract = {The development of transgender rights in the United States has been
   hobbled by a patchwork of inconsistent state laws. The irregularity is a
   function of the political opportunity structure in the United States,
   which is defined by a sharp partisan divide and by the federal system's
   division of power. National policymaking on transgender rights has
   stalled in Congress. Executive branch policymaking is often subject to
   challenge in the federal courts, and different administrations have
   varied in their approaches. In addition, the Supreme Court's decision in
   Bostock narrowly advanced transgender rights in employment law but also
   invited challenges in other areas. With inaction and inconsistency at
   the national level, states are using their reserved powers in the
   federal system to diverge along the partisan divide.
   Republican-controlled states are enacting repressive measures, while
   Democratic-controlled states have done the opposite. For transgender
   people, their rights are increasingly dependent on which state they are
   in.},

Abstract = {We study the effect of expanding trade on societal coalitions through
   its impact on development. We combine a majoritarian political model
   with a spatial model of trade to argue that trade-induced economic
   change-by bringing new workers to locations closer to world markets-can
   lead to losses rather than gains in political power for the factors of
   production advantaged by increased trade. We study how this phenomenon
   explains rising protectionism in the United States from 1880 to 1900.
   Using county-level changes in transportation costs induced by railroad
   expansion, our estimates indicate that falling costs increased
   population and farm values but reduced the proportion of farmers.
   Reduced transportation costs caused a reduction in vote shares for the
   Democratic Party, which favored liberal trade policies, and an increase
   in an original newspaper-based measure of protectionist sentiment.
   Expanding trade alters not only political interests but also the
   geographic distribution of those interests.},

Abstract = {As factionalism becomes increasingly prominent within the Conservative
   Party, understanding the worldviews of the respective groupings has
   become key to understanding the party itself. This is especially true
   regarding the one nation group which is the most numerous in Parliament.
   From the Cameron era, the term `one nation' expressed leaders' attempts
   to modernise the party, reckon with the Thatcherite social legacy, and
   carve out a distinct centre-right identity which contained both socially
   liberal and distinctly conservative elements. However, reconciling
   `modern' and `conservative' views has been singularly difficult. Whilst
   bridging the two rhetorically and intellectually has been possible,
   leaders have struggled to translate such a synthesis into a viable
   governmental agenda that unites the party. Underlying this difficulty is
   fierce disagreement on immigration, sovereignty, nationhood and
   cosmopolitanism, resulting in one nation conservatism becoming a signal
   of intra-party disagreement rather than unifying leadership.},

Title = {From regional autonomy towards horizontal and vertical congruence
   coalition politics in Polish regions in the period 1998-2018},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 25},
Abstract = {In 1999 regional self-government was established in Poland and,
   subsequently, politics began to operate in a new multilevel setting. The
   question raised in this article is, how did Polish parties adapt to
   functioning in a multilevel system focusing on coalition politics? The
   analysis of documents - regional assemblies' resolutions were used to
   track regional coalition formation in the period 1998-2018 - was
   supplemented by data gathered from the author's interviews with regional
   politicians. The tendency to avoid cross-cutting coalitions was evident
   from the first two elections when regional politics was rather
   autonomous. Vertically and horizontally congruent coalitions gradually
   became standard when advantageous conditions occurred after 2006. The
   particular features of the party system leading to the avoidance of
   cross-cutting coalitions were the role of socio-political cleavage, that
   is a `post-communist divide' and, later, rising polarization within a
   bipolar party system. Cross-cutting coalitions were occasionally
   acceptable but never those requiring cooperation between a majority
   party forming the government and the main opposition party at the
   central level. Recent studies indicate the rise of divergent coalitions
   in Europe, but in Polish regions, the contrary tendency has been
   observed.},

Abstract = {During the pandemic, science became one of the most salient issues in
   European polities. At the same time, relevant sectors of European
   societies were sceptical about science-driven policy to contain the
   pandemic (e.g., lockdowns or vaccine mandates). The literature so far
   has analysed the relevance of trust in experts and trust in science in
   determining compliance to pandemic-related policies. However, we still
   do not know what are the drivers that lead to (dis)trust science. In
   this paper, we contribute to fill this gap, by analysing the association
   between technocratic and populist attitudes and trust in science. Using
   a novel survey, fielded in Italy, among a sample of 5.000 respondents,
   we show that populism and technocracy are strongly related with
   (dis)trust in science in opposite directions.},

Abstract = {This article defends the importance of the idea of historical progress
   for constructivist justifications of moral normativity inspired by
   Kant's analysis of practical reason. Focusing on some key methodological
   requirements that must be satisfied for the constructivist vindication
   of practical normativity to succeed, the article focuses on the concept
   of purposiveness as it develops within Kant's moral and political
   philosophy. It concludes that without a critical notion of
   `purposiveness' and related philosophical analysis of history, the
   constructivist rejection of scepticism is at risk of circularity.},

Abstract = {This research note reports on a new dataset about legislators in four
   Canadian provinces since the establishment of their colonial assemblies
   in the eighteenth century. Over 7,000 legislators from Ontario, Quebec,
   New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia are included, with consolidated
   information drawn from multiple sources about parliamentarians' years of
   birth and death, religion, electoral performance, kinship, and several
   other biographical indicators. We also illustrate the utility of such
   data with the help of a few descriptive examples drawn from the four
   provinces. We believe this consolidated dataset offers several
   opportunities for future research on representation, legislative
   activities and party politics.

Abstract = {This paper seeks a multifactorial explanation to the problem of the
   increase in violence in Ecuador in recent years. To this end, the topic
   is presented along two axes. First, it offers a general approach to
   violence from the transnational and global perspective of organized
   crime. The general structure of illicit economies is discussed and
   several explanations for the dynamics of violence are proposed, linking
   global and local problems. Secondly, data about violence in the country
   is presented, and the evolution of the different scenarios that arise in
   each region is discussed. Descriptive statistics are shown, and a model
   is also proposed, in an exploratory manner, that links different
   variables of the socioeconomic structure of the country's cantons to
   relate them to violence. Finally, a review is made of the general
   situation of prisons in the country.},

Abstract = {Parliamentary elections in 2020 brought new political parties in
   Croatia, but this now encompassed the whole political spectrum. Using
   survey data, the article aims to identify sources of electoral support
   for new parties and how they relate to traditional political cleavages.
   The article finds that voters of the new parties differ from voters of
   the old parties primarily in how they perceive politics, and are also
   younger. At the same time, voters of the new parties on the left and the
   right are very similar to voters of the old left and right parties,
   respectively, pointing to still dominant role of the cleavages based on
   relation to history, religion and tradition. In the second step, the
   analysis also includes non-voters and finds that voters of the new
   parties and abstainers are similar in how they see politics, but
   abstainers feel much less confident about their ability to influence
   political events.},

Abstract = {Does the adoption of restrictive regulations shape numbers of
   non-governmental organizations? Since the late 1990s, governments around
   the world have been enacting new legal measures designed to suppress
   civil society's functions and organizational space to carry out advocacy
   and politically oriented work. Scholars have investigated the impact of
   these new regulations on foreign aid flows, voting behavior, and on
   organizations, but to date, we lack a systematic analysis about the
   cross-national global effects of these legal restrictions on numbers of
   international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) in particular,
   since it is these organizations (and their funders) that have been
   heavily targeted. In this research note, we fill this gap through an
   empirical analysis of the effects of various types of restrictive laws
   on INGO numbers in 96 countries between 1992 and 2018 and find that
   advocacy restrictions result in a reduction of transnational human
   rights organizations but not numbers of INGOs.},

Abstract = {This work offers a new democratic case for federalism, understood as a
   form of governance in which multiple entities in a country possess final
   decision-making authority (viz., can make decisions free from others
   substituting their decisions, issuing fines, etc.) over at least one
   subject (e.g., immigration, defense). It argues that leading solutions
   to the democratic boundary problem provide overlapping arguments for
   federalism. The underlying logic and many details of the most commonly
   cited solutions focused on those relevantly affected by and subject to
   decisions each support three distinct arguments (focused on voteshares,
   other forms of democratic influence, and persistent minorities) for
   multiple demoi possessing authority in a polity. Federalism is the best
   available method for recognizing the distinct demoi. This not only
   supports federal governance as opposed to unitary governance and
   subsidiarity. It also suggests that democracy and federalism are
   importantly related and have several implications for institutional
   design.},

Abstract = {Voting behaviour in Western Europe has become increasingly structured by
   attitudes towards socio-cultural issues, such as immigration and
   European unification. This study examines whether generational
   differences affect this form of realignment. By combining data from the
   ESS and the CHES, it explores party-voter alignment on specific issues
   across 17 West European party systems from 2002 to 2020.
   `Age-Period-Cohort' (APC) analyses demonstrate that younger generations
   are more strongly aligned than older generations on immigration,
   LGBTQ+-rights, the environment and left-right placement, but not on the
   EU and income redistribution. The results also show over-time increases
   in issue alignment for three of the six issues, but these period effects
   are more country-specific than the generational differences.
   Consequently, generational replacement can be expected to increase
   party-voter alignment on the left-right dimension and (some) new issues.},

Month = {2024 APR 10},
Abstract = {Does co-ethnic cabinet representation change how people respond to
   increasing ethnic cabinet diversity? Existing literature studies
   co-ethnic representation and cabinet diversity separately. I argue that
   the interaction between co-ethnic cabinet representation and ethnic
   cabinet diversity lowers government confidence and impacts feelings of
   ethnic fairness. Using a newly constructed dataset linking both the
   World Values Survey and the Afrobarometer to country-year measures of
   ethnic cabinet diversity, I find that interacting co-ethnic
   representation with ethnic cabinet diversity largely has the expected
   results. Country leaders should think carefully about how to manage
   cabinet appointments in order to improve attitudes toward government.},

Abstract = {Scholars have recently focused on the eco-nationalist ``turn{''} of the
   far-right right parties in Europe and their obstruction of a substantive
   environmental agenda. However, we argue that the analysis of the
   far-right eco-nationalism must be broadened to include certain
   established and impactful centre-right European parties. By focusing on
   the single case-study of the centre-right People's Party (PP) in Spain,
   we argue that it has articulated Manichean, negationist, anti-elitist,
   and conspirative discursive elements typical of the far-right
   eco-nationalism before the emergence of Vox, the Spanish far-right
   party. In actuality, starting with 2019, Vox adopted and developed an
   eco-nationalist narrative advanced first at the ``centre{''} by the
   ex-Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and still influential today at the
   level of PP's leadership, namely a narrative framing ecology as ``the
   new communism{''} and the (global) progressive elites and
   ``consensus{''} as threatening the free Spanish nation and ``freedom{''}
   worldwide.},

Abstract = {South Sudan's civil war has since 2013 threatened the protection of
   civilians, which UN peacekeepers are mandated to ensure. One aspect
   represented a new challenge, due to its scale and rapid onset: more than
   200,000 civilians fled to UN bases across the country, seeking
   protection. This amounted to more than a tenth of all internally placed
   people at one stage. The response by the UN helped to save many lives,
   but created further dilemmas. Real problems were also experienced, with
   attacks on these `sites' and on peacekeepers. This article analyses the
   significance of the phenomenon and how it unfolded.},

Abstract = {In this interview with Kristen Ghodsee, (conducted by Rethinking
   Marxism's Overdetermined podcast team Maliha Safri, Jared Randall, and
   Ryan Watts, and edited for brevity and clarity for print publication by
   Kenan Er \& ccedil;el), her three recent books are discussed: Second
   World, Second Sex: Socialist Women's Activism and Global Solidarity
   during the Cold War; Why Women Have Better Sex Under Socialism and Other
   Arguments for Economic Independence; and Red Hangover: Legacies of 20th
   Century Communism. Taped at the height of the pandemic in 2021, the
   conversation explores how relations between men and women are shaped by
   social systems including capitalism in the West, and socialism in the
   `second world.' Ghodsee describes her own interests in Alexandra
   Kollontai, Nadezhda Krupskaya, and how they influenced her own writing
   that encompasses multiple modalities of research including in-depth
   field work, fiction, and archival research in multiple eastern European
   countries. Going between the current day and the past, Ghodsee
   emphasizes how economic systems and psychosocial stress show up in how
   families arrange unpaid labor, sex, and every other intimate arena of
   life.},

Abstract = {Russia's invasion of Ukraine is an attack on democracy, human rights,
   and the international order. While European democracies have supported
   their war-torn partner, Russia has sought to undermine public support by
   stopping its gas supply and imposing economic costs on European
   citizens. In consequence, Europeans find themselves caught between
   economic self-interest and principles. We present a theoretical argument
   and test how corresponding arguments for and against continued backing
   of Ukraine affect citizens' support using experimental and observational
   data collected while concerns with gas shortage and inflation mounted in
   Germany and Denmark. We find that support for Ukraine does not falter
   due to economic concerns. In contrast, citizens become more supportive
   when presented with arguments related to human rights, democracy, and
   respect for territorial boundaries. We discuss implications for
   understanding citizens' responses to autocratic power strategies and how
   support likely depends on the type of partner and domestic elite
   rhetoric.},

Abstract = {This article will explain further the inter -regional governance
   cooperation required by regions that touch each other, as well as by
   regions that have similar areas and natural products. Cooperation is
   needed to meet the needs of a region that cannot be met alone and
   therefore requires assistance from other regions. This article uses
   examples of successful collaboration carried out by the East Java
   Provincial Government where there are several good collaborations that
   will be and are currently being carried out. The method used in this
   writing is literature study by analyzing previous research that has been
   carried out and then analyzing it with appropriate theory to arrive at
   conclusions that are in line with what was expected. The results in this
   paper are that in the process of cooperation, commitment from each
   region is very much needed, there must be an official written agreement
   to enter into a collaboration. In developments in the field it is also
   known that in implementing cooperation there is a need for other actors
   who are interconnected. The conclusion in this paper is that in managing
   cooperation, each region must have principles that must be upheld, for
   example in implementing cooperation in East Java Province which uses
   Mintzberg principles, then in implementing cooperation it will use
   Mintzberg principles. It also involves other elements which in this case
   are known as the pentahelix concept.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In 2012, Barcelona City Council introduced a new city agency that would
   provide housing and resources for migrants and refugees living within
   their city-irregular migrants. This esteemed sanctuary city policy
   further integrated irregular migrants into city life; however, how did
   natives respond to this effort? Through a difference in differences
   methodological approach and public opinion survey data from 2008 to
   2017, I provide evidence of more positive native attitudes towards
   irregular migrants and immigration policy. I speculate that the increase
   in positive perceptions occur due to contact theory. While a single-case
   study, these findings provide hope for how city governments feeling the
   burden of the ongoing refugee crisis can adequately provide support for
   their irregular migrant populations without fear of backlash from their
   citizens.},

Title = {Central African Republic: The Politicization of Religion and Conflict},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Number = {47},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Central African Republic (CAR) has been a theater of hostilities for
   decades, including the Seleka rebellion in December 2012, which caused
   religious-based discrimination, especially between the Muslim minority
   and Christian majority. Opportunistic political leaders and armed groups
   have misused religion for political and egocentric gains in the CAR. The
   purpose of this qualitative content analysis research is to investigate
   the use of religion for political motives in the CAR and how such
   actions impact conflict and sectarian divides in the so-called phantom
   state. The paper recommends ways to mitigate political influence and the
   misuse of religion by political and armed group actors in the CAR. Very
   little or no literature on conflict in the CAR has specifically
   addressed the influence of politics on religion and how it contributes
   to fueling conflict in the country. This study fills the gaps in the
   literature by investigating the historical narratives of the CAR
   conflict while highlighting instances of political abuse of religion. A
   review of existing literature on the political manipulation of religion
   establishes the basis for a critical analysis of the influence of
   politics on religion in the CAR and its impact on conflict.},

Abstract = {Conjoint experiments are fast becoming one of the dominant experimental
   methods within the social sciences. Despite recent efforts to model
   heterogeneity within this type of experiment, the relationship between
   the conjoint design and lower-level causal estimands is underdeveloped.
   In this article, we clarify how conjoint heterogeneity can be construed
   as a set of nested, causal parameters that correspond to the levels of
   the conjoint design. We then use this framework to propose a new
   estimation strategy, using machine learning, that better allows
   researchers to evaluate treatment effect heterogeneity. We also provide
   novel tools for classifying and analyzing heterogeneity postestimation
   using partitioning algorithms. Replicating two conjoint experiments, we
   demonstrate our theoretical argument and show how this method helps
   estimate and detect substantive patterns of heterogeneity. To accompany
   this article, we provide new a R package, cjbart, that allows
   researchers to model heterogeneity in their experimental conjoint data.},

Abstract = {This article examines the evolution of public service broadcasting (PSB)
   regulation in the UK, contrasting two opposing perspectives on its role

   context and recent regulatory changes, the article argues that PSB

   content and serving the public good. However, it identifies
   technological advancements and political interference as significant
   threats to its continued success. The article critically evaluates the
   draft Media Bill's potential to address these challenges and enhance
   PSB's competitiveness. Additionally, it raises concerns about potential
   bias within the regulatory body, Ofcom, urging greater transparency and
   fairness in its oversight of the media market. The article emphasises
   the need for a robust regulatory framework to ensure the continued
   viability of PSB and foster a vibrant and diverse media ecosystem.},

Title = {Stanley Cavell, John Rawls and moral perfectionism in liberal democracy},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 27},
Abstract = {John Rawls was what we might call a ``frenemy{''} to Stanley Cavell.
   Time and again, Cavell states his admiration for Rawls's political
   philosophy but criticizes it for two reasons. First, he believes that
   Rawls too hastily dismisses a perfectionist tradition that is essential
   for a flourishing liberal democracy. Second, he attacks certain aspects
   of Rawls's theory of justice as moralistic and legalistic. The first
   half of this article examines Cavell's critique of Rawls and argues that
   the two authors are more closely aligned than suspected. It begins by
   reconstructing Cavell's critique of Rawls, and using archival materials
   from Harvard University, presents for the first time Rawls's
   interpretation of this critique. The second half of the article
   highlights perfectionist themes in Rawls's A Theory of Justice. The
   contribution of this article is to reevaluate the relationship between
   two of the most important moral philosophers of the twentieth century
   and also to provide a more expansive theory of liberalism that
   incorporates the psychological depth, moral subtlety and political
   hopefulness of moral perfectionism.},

Abstract = {Political competition accelerates the enactment of lesbian, gay,
   bisexual, trans{*}, and intersexual rights (LGBTI+) due to the dynamic,
   rational behavior of mainstream parties across the political aisle to
   adapt to the sociopolitical environment. We argue that LGBTI+ social
   movements capitalize on median voter shifts combined with the rising
   pressure of ideologically close challenger parties to enact legislation.
   To examine this argument, we employ quantitative event history analysis
   with a unique dataset with measures for social movement, institutional,
   political, and sociocultural dimensions across 33 years in Spanish
   subnational arenas. We find that rising leftist and liberal contenders
   challenging dominant center-left and center-right parties, respectively,
   widen the opportunity political structure of LGBTI+ organizations.
   Ultimately, rising political fragmentation in a multiparty,
   multidimensional party system turns both left and right mainstream
   parties into allies of LGBTI+ organizations, which propose new
   legislation, due to political platforms seeking to preserve and enhance
   their electoral base.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, Canada and other democracies have experienced a
   significant rise in migrant settlement. This has sparked much interest
   among scholars and policy makers in the forces that encourage or impede
   the political incorporation of newcomers. In this research note, we
   consider a factor that has received relatively little scrutiny, the
   impact of immigrants' attention to native-country politics on
   willingness to participate in residential-country elections and
   affiliate with a political party in that country. We examine this
   through an original survey of Americans in Canada conducted during the
   2020 US election cycle. A randomized experiment demonstrates that
   directing the attention of American emigrants to US campaigns can lower
   interest in Canadian elections and weaken attachments to a Canadian
   political party, particularly for those who are less integrated into
   Canadian society. These findings point to a potential tension between
   political engagement as an emigrant versus as an immigrant.
   Au cours des dernieres decennies, le Canada et d'autres democraties ont
   connu une augmentation significative de l'etablissement de migrants.
   Cette situation a suscite beaucoup d'interet de la part des chercheurs
   et des decideurs pour les forces qui favorisent ou entravent
   l'integration politique des nouveaux arrivants. Dans cette note de
   recherche, nous examinons un facteur qui a ete relativement peu etudie,
   a savoir l'impact de l'attention portee par les immigrants a la
   politique de leur pays d'origine sur leur volonte de participer aux
   elections de leur pays de residence et de s'affilier a un parti
   politique dans ce pays. Nous examinons cette question a l'aide d'une
   enquete originale menee aupres d'Americains au Canada pendant le cycle
   electoral americain de 2020. Une experience randomisee demontre que le
   fait d'attirer l'attention des emigrants americains sur les campagnes
   americaines peut diminuer l'interet pour les elections canadiennes et
   affaiblir l'attachement a un parti politique canadien, en particulier
   pour ceux qui sont moins integres dans la societe canadienne. Ces
   resultats mettent en evidence une tension potentielle entre l'engagement
   politique en tant qu'emigrant et en tant qu'immigrant.},

Abstract = {The two-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine affords an
   occasion to examine why the war has produced such deep rifts within the
   Left Party and the AfD. Drawing upon party documents, parliamentary
   proceedings, electoral and polling data and secondary literature, this
   article examines why Russia's war against Ukraine proved so disruptive
   to both parties and explores the implications of these intraparty
   conflicts. Germany's domestic politics of the Ukraine War matter given
   Berlin's central role in backing the Kyiv government. This article
   assesses three explanations for the lack of internal unity in the Left
   Party and AfD regarding a new Russia policy: (a) path dependency; (b)
   eastern Germany, and (c) the reinforcing rather than crosscutting nature
   of the Ukraine War vis-a-vis the primary intraparty cleavage. It finds
   that the third explanation fits both Left Party and AfD cases.},

Abstract = {Former President Trump's persistent influence over Republican politics
   divides those who argue that he mobilizes otherwise apathetic voters
   against those contending he mobilizes Democrats at down-ballot
   Republicans' expense. Scholars and pundits alike question whether policy
   still matters in the face of increasingly strong personas like the
   former president's. Using a survey experiment, we find suggestive
   evidence that Trump's endorsement in a general election reduces the
   likelihood of voting for a hypothetical Republican candidate. We also
   test the effect of policy stances and find evidence that Republican
   respondents value policy stances over an endorsement, but Democrats show
   no signs of prioritizing one more than the other. However, when shown a
   hypothetical candidate with unorthodox policy stances, the mere mention
   of a Trump endorsement leads members of both parties to demonstrate
   significant changes in the likelihood of voting for that candidate.
   Ultimately, we show that elite signals can attenuate support derived
   from policies.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship on the American South emphasizes how changing
   settlement patterns affect party politics. Specifically, places with
   high population growth are shifting toward the Democratic Party whereas
   localities shedding residents favor Republicans. This insight is
   important but also in need of empirical refinement. In this study, we
   examine settlement patterns and changes in the racial composition of the
   southern electorate at three different units of analysis: states,
   counties, and individuals with an original survey of respondents
   residing in the South. We include place-specific variables indicating
   where respondents grew up and where they currently live to gain a more
   accurate picture of how settlement patterns are altering the southern
   electorate.},

Abstract = {We explore whether the effects of colorism on evaluations of politicians
   is moderated by shared partisanship. We hypothesize that colorism will
   lead Whites to rate darker elected officials of color more poorly.
   Additionally, we hypothesize that partisanship will moderate this
   relationship with Whites being less likely to engage in colorism when
   evaluating co-partisans. We test our hypotheses using a crowd-sourced
   measure of skin tone based on the Massey-Martin index and the 2016,
   2018, and 2020 Congressional Election Studies. We find that
   darker-skinned elected officials of color from a different party receive
   less support among Whites. In contrast, we find that skin tone does not
   influence support for co-partisan elected officials of color. Additional
   analysis demonstrates that the effect of colorism on evaluation of
   out-group partisans is strongest for Whites who score high on a racial
   conservatism measure.},

Abstract = {The present study investigates great power competition and its
   ramifications for Pakistan in the South Asian regional hierarchy during
   the Cold War. The previous studies lack theoretical rigor in their
   respective explanation of great power competition in the international
   system and its fallout for the South Asian region. This gap is more
   pronounced in case of great power competition between the United States
   and the former Soviet Union when Pakistan was an ally of the United
   States for security assistance in the 1950s and 1960s. While some
   authors have used realist and neorealist frameworks to understand the
   dynamics of Pakistan's relations with the then great powers, we employ
   the Power Transition Theory (PTT) to examine the phenomenon. The PTT as
   a theoretical framework offers more comprehensive understanding of great
   power competition and its impact on Pakistan's security needs in the
   context of regional dynamics during the Cold War. This study finds that
   following Pakistan's alliance with United States, military spending of
   the country grew rapidly and reached an unprecedented high level leading
   to military modernization- a much needed factor of deterrence posture
   vis-a-vis India. The pursuit of power parity and balancing by Pakistan,
   coupled with India's alignment with the Soviet Union, created a tense
   environment in South Asia. These dynamics ultimately led to the outbreak
   of 1965 and 1971 wars. While the United States and the Soviet Union were
   the primary players, China's strategic involvement in great power
   competition has had a marked impact on Pakistan's ability to deter
   India.},

Abstract = {This article examines the complexities surrounding the implementation of
   comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) within Ghana's basic education
   system, exploring the intersection of religious, cultural, and political
   factors. Introducing CSE has sparked significant public discourse and
   resistance in Ghana, where religious and cultural beliefs are deeply
   ingrained and often institutionalized in politics. The study utilizes
   punctuated equilibrium theory to understand the sustained opposition to
   CSE policy changes. It examines the historical progression of Ghana's
   educational reforms, highlighting the struggle to maintain cultural and
   religious values while promoting human rights and gender equality. The
   contribution of this study is its exploration of the political
   institutionalization of religion in Ghana, investigating the combined
   impact of religious bodies, political entities, and civil organizations
   in shaping public opinion on education policy reform. It further
   underscores the intricate task of navigating socio-cultural beliefs and
   human rights in policy-making processes.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the Historical Institutionalism literature
   on stability and change by unpacking how an institution has persisted
   for more than 70 years despite substantial contextual changes. The
   overall stability of the institution comes both through changes in
   policy instruments and their settings, and through the incorporation of
   differing, but aligned rationales. Ideational multidimensionality yields
   stability by providing leeway to recondition the institution in response
   to changing circumstances. This allows for different interests in the
   coalition to stimulate overall institutional stability by supporting
   incremental changes in policy instruments whilst avoiding institutional
   exhaustion and third order changes. This shows that policies initiated
   under a certain set of circumstances may be better equipped to persist
   when circumstances change if they are able to incorporate differing, but
   aligned, rationales and to respond to upcoming issues through policy
   instrument changes. The theoretical arguments are exemplified through a
   case study analysis of Norwegian agricultural policy.},

Title = {Nationalism and Conflict: How Do Variations of Nationalism Affect
   Variations in Domestic and International Conflict?},

Abstract = {This article advances a novel theoretical framework for explaining the
   emergence of international and domestic conflicts, especially in the
   twenty-first century. I argue that nationalism plays a major role in the
   rise of these conflicts. Yet, nationalism is not monolithic. I
   distinguish among five types of nationalism (satisfied; stateless;
   consolidating; irredentist; populist). The variations in the type of
   nationalism explain variations in peace and conflict in different parts
   of the world. The explanation of the variations of types of nationalism,
   in turn, is based on the combined effect of variations in state capacity
   (i.e., the functioning of state institutions) and national congruence
   (i.e., the congruence between national identities and state borders).
   Variations in these two independent variables account for both civil and
   international wars as well as for peaceful states and for domestic
   polarization. Thus, national congruence and high capacity produce
   satisfied nationalism and a peaceful state. In contrast, national
   incongruence and low capacity lead to stateless nationalism and, thus,
   to civil wars in failed states. High capacity and national incongruence,
   especially external incongruence, produce irredentist nationalism of
   revisionist states, leading to war-prone interstate conflicts. High
   capacity and declining congruence generate nationalist populism and
   societal polarization. Thus, the theory developed here explains the
   recent rise of nationalist populism (and the related domestic
   polarization) in quite a few democracies in comparison with other types

Abstract = {The Western Sahara territory is a non-self-governing territory under
   international law with an ongoing struggle for self-determination from
   colonisation and alien occupation. The unresolved statehood of the
   Western Sahara territory complicates the nationality status of the
   indigenous Saharawis and threatens their human right to a nationality.
   Legal identity documents have implications for the right to nationality
   of the individual under international law. Morocco (as the occupying
   power in control of most of the Western Sahara territory) and the
   Polisario Front (as the national liberation movement engaged in the
   struggle against colonisation and alien occupation) issue legal identity
   documents to the Saharawis. This article ascertains that these documents
   have an effect on the right to nationality of the Saharawis. This
   article finds that while the Moroccan-issued documents violate the
   Saharawis' right to nationality, the Polisario Front-issued documents
   uphold this right and could clarify the Saharawis' nationality status.},

Abstract = {Scholarship on the American founding generally argues for a Lockean
   liberal republicanism as the philosophical base for American political
   institutions. But American founding father James Wilson rejected Locke's
   epistemology and moral science in favor of Thomas Reid's as a
   theoretical support for popular sovereignty in a large republic. This
   article offers a new interpretation of Wilson's writings by directly
   juxtaposing his and Locke's epistemology and moral science. A close and
   comparative reading of Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding and
   Wilson's Lectures on Law demonstrates that Wilson thinks that American
   political culture needed to include support for universal suffrage,
   understanding government's end as promoting individual happiness found
   in pursuing virtue rather than property, and that all citizens are
   responsible for the truthful reputation of being a virtuous person.
   Wilson uses Reid's epistemology and moral science to offer a cultural
   support for popular sovereignty that acts as an alternative to Lockean
   self-interest.},

Abstract = {This introductory article, and the additional 11 contributions that
   comprise this special issue of Citizenship Studies, uses political
   science, international law and anthropology literature to unmoor the
   primacy of the nation-state as the sole entity able to confer legal
   identity on individuals. It does this by examining legal identity
   documents, and their ramifications, in entities that exist physically
   but do not exist (entirely) legally or politically, what we term
   aspirant states. We find that doing so highlights that these aspirant
   states are not a set of problems to be redressed by integrating these
   anomalous spaces into the international order with better governance or
   juridical disambiguation. Rather, legal identity documents issued by
   aspirant states raise more fundamental questions about contemporary
   citizenship regimes in general and about the way law and state authority
   are constructed and reproduced. Such arguments force us to contest and
   reconsider the violent and circular logic of the current nation-state
   system and how legal identity, and citizenship, is conferred and
   maintained.},

Abstract = {Conducted against the backdrop of international debates on colonial and
   racist crimes, this study examines representations of the Second
   Italo-Ethiopian War in Italian secondary school history textbooks from
   the fascist period to the present. In a systematic analysis, the article
   explores how textbooks, as key ``memory-makers,{''} depict the
   motivations, context, course, and consequences of a colonial war
   frequently subject to amnesia in Italy. We explore the distortions,
   omissions, and demystification textbooks have promoted over time,
   measuring them against historiographical advancements. Overall, we
   observe growing recognition of arbitrary Italian aggression and the
   illegal use of chemical weapons, but fluctuations in the assessment of
   European responsibilities and Mussolini's involvement in the Second
   World War and the Holocaust. Silencing, minimization of responsibility,
   and a strong Italo- and Eurocentric tendency persist in the textbooks,
   whose lacunae and inaccuracies appear to feed into the enduring myth of

Abstract = {Do female candidates give up running for office after losing more
   readily than their male counter-parts? I address this question by
   employing a regression discontinuity between last winners and first
   losers in city council elections in Brazil. The results show that losing
   an election diminishes the chances of running again for both genders.
   However, the effect is large for women. I offer an explanation for this
   gender gap in rerunning by developing a model based on the distribution
   of campaign financial resources among candidates. I argue that female
   candidates receive fewer financial resources from donors and their
   political parties than male candidates. Consequently, to run for office,
   women often need to use more of their own money. This leads to a faster
   depletion of their personal financial resources and, ultimately, a
   greater likelihood of them dropping out of politics. The argument is
   supported by evidence on campaign financing for the same period.},

Abstract = {The distinctiveness of the post-communist region has been hotly debated
   since the end of the Cold War. Using cluster analysis with a wide range
   of demographic, political, socioeconomic, and attitudinal variables, we
   find that 28 post-communist countries do not form a distinct region
   along most of these dimensions. This analysis suggests that the
   ``transition{''} paradigm is outdated, and researchers should use the
   concept of ``post-communism{''} with caution. Yet, we do not dismiss the
   concept of a communist legacy, which may exist on dimensions not
   captured by conventional indicators. We also emphasize that regional
   knowledge on post-communist countries remains vital.},

Abstract = {Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Padmaavat, a Bollywood period drama, engendered
   a variety of conversations about identity, history, etc. in India. This
   article examines the ways in which the reception of the film
   performatively produced a genre of history in the Indian public sphere.
   Such performative productions of history as a genre runs counter to the
   prevalent notion of history as pre-given with concrete referents and
   past incidents. The allegation of ``distortion{''} (of ``history{''}) is
   mobilized as a psychoanalytic resource to demonstrate this point. In the
   process, I note how the existing approaches to Hindu nationalism are
   inadequate in their critical clarity.},

Abstract = {Within the Iranian-American community in rural Kentucky, pre-migratory
   ideas and practices from the homeland play crucial roles in community
   formation. They use their compromised pre-migratory identities,
   middle-class achievements, and adherence to local norms to create a
   community composed of cultural citizens. Drawing upon their upwardly
   mobile middle-class status, my interlocutors challenged local
   racialization dynamics while adopting local norms that emphasized the
   importance of faith, church, and community. Through negotiations of
   their contested past cultural citizenships, they were able to create
   unique forms of claiming U.S. cultural citizenship, which enabled them
   to build a unified and harmonious diasporic community. The Iranian case
   compels us to consider how a full spectrum of factors, including
   educational and professional achievement, social class, local norms, the
   homeland contested identities, national politics, and local
   community-building initiatives, interplay in shaping the endeavours of
   Muslims to combat racialization and achieve cultural citizenship within
   American society.},

Abstract = {There is a small but growing literature on the staffs working in
   national parliaments. These are mostly single-country studies studying
   one role that staff can play or one principal that they serve. Our
   contribution provides a comprehensive measurement instrument of the role
   of parliamentary staff, which takes into account organisational
   diversity within and between parliaments. We recognise four types of
   staff that may be present to a greater or lesser extent in different
   parliaments, which have different principals (PPG staff, personal staff,
   plenary or committee staff). These different staffs can play different
   roles (information broker, advisor, ghostwriter, compromise facilitator
   and marketeer). We apply this typology to the Dutch lower house and find
   out how different types of staff combine multiple roles in practice.},

Abstract = {The two ideas of the rationality of terrorist organisations and the
   costly leader game are used in this paper to construct a game theoretic
   model. It is an addition to the literature on terrorism and
   leader-follower games, in which the government and a terrorist
   organisation are the two players. Terrorist group can be rational or
   irrational. In case it is rational, it does the cost-benefit analysis
   and is open to negotiation. Only in this case, the government chooses to
   not spend on counter-terrorist measures. The irrational group has
   lexicographic preferences, which means that it prefers a successful
   attack to attract attention and recruits at the beginning or finish of
   its operation. Consequently, it is assumed that the irrational group
   will always attack. the irrational terrorist organisation has the option
   of either choosing not to mimic the rational group or choosing to do so
   at a psychological cost. Although the irrational group dislikes
   imitation. It seeks to duplicate the rational group so that the
   government withdraws and cuts back on spending on counter-terrorism. A
   costly leader model is set up in the paper, where the government can
   incur a cost to gather information about the type of terrorist group. In
   this framework, the paper provides policy prescriptions concerning
   counter-terrorist measures that the government should take in case the
   type of terrorist group being rational or irrational is unknown and it
   highlights the importance of intelligence.},

Title = {Backlash or Progressive Mobilization? Voter Reactions to Perceived
   Trajectories of Women's Representation},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 13},
Abstract = {Existing research on the effects of women's descriptive representation
   on citizens' attitudes has mainly investigated potential positive
   effects, namely on political engagement or the legitimacy of outcomes.
   However, trends in representation have rarely been theorized as
   potential causes of resentment among women. While a male backlash to
   increasing representation has been theorized, this article argues that
   women may also be discontent with their trajectory of representation, if
   they perceive it as stagnating. Using a survey experiment fielded in
   Germany, the results show that a stagnating representation trajectory
   mobilizes women to vote for a progressive party, the German Greens. In
   contrast, the paper demonstrates that men do not lash back against
   women's increasing representation, even if they realize that this means
   a lower standing for themselves. This article contributes to research on
   political behavior by highlighting that discontent with persisting
   inequality is a mobilizing factor for progressive parties.},

Title = {Why do LGB vote left? Insight into left-wing voting of lesbian, gay and
   bisexual citizens in Austria},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {87},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Previous research on the voting behavior of lesbian, gay, and bisexual
   (LGB) in Europe showed that LGB people favor left-wing or progressive
   parties (Turnbull-Dugarte 2020; Hunklinger 2021; Wurthmann 2023).
   Furthermore, Turnbull-Dugarte (2021) showed that LGB voters are,
   possibly due to their socialization, supportive of social liberalism and
   progressive issues. As we know from classic voting theory, there are
   different explanations for voting behavior, e.g. issue orientation,
   candidate and party preferences. This paper explores why LGB persons
   vote for left-wing parties in Austria. We use a sample among LGB persons
   conducted upfront the 2019 national elections in Austria. We test to
   what extent issue and candidate orientations (including LGB issues) as
   well as group identity affect LGB persons' intended voting behavior for
   left-wing parties in Austria. Our results show that instead of
   group-specific issue orientations, a general issue orientation, and
   socio-cultural attitudes are crucial for LGB persons to vote for
   left-wing parties},

Abstract = {Normatively, democratic constitutions should express how citizens want
   to govern themselves collectively. Little is known, however, about how
   citizens' constitutional preferences can be elicited and aggregated in
   practice. An intuitively appealing approach is to allow various forms of
   popular participation during a constitution-making process, including a
   popular vote to accept or reject the draft constitution (Fishkin 2011).
   Based on the Chilean experience with democratic constitution making,
   this article identifies unanticipated and previously unexplored
   distortions that can lead to incongruence between the preferences of
   voters and representatives regarding the extent and direction of
   constitutional change.},

Abstract = {This article undertakes a comparative analysis of two cases, Hong Kong
   and South Korea, each characterized by distinct levels of political and
   civil liberties to elucidate how the institutionalization of national
   security operates in shaping the repertoires of popular political
   actions and the repressive conduct of state actors. In both cases, the
   legal frameworks serve to curtail popular political action, both online
   and offline, often through discretionary applications of national
   security norms, resulting in ambiguity. They bestow legitimacy upon
   state agencies to engage in protest policing, surveillance, and the
   suppression of individuals or organizations in the name of upholding
   national security. In contrast, the national security laws in Hong Kong
   and South Korea, influenced by varying interpretations and applications
   of perceived threats to national security, result in differences in the
   extent and degree of contentious political actions and state repression.},

Abstract = {All over the world, a very large number of elections take place
   concurrently with other elections for representatives in different
   government tiers. A crucial question for understanding electoral
   outcomes in those elections is the existence of electoral spillovers or
   coattail effects. Causal identification of coattail effects is
   challenging because popularity shocks typically affect parties in both
   concurrent elections. This paper exploits a quasi-experiment-the ban of
   a party in only one of the concurrent elections-to estimate coattail
   effects. The results show that a 1 pp decline in electoral support for a
   party in a given election reduces its support in the concurrent election
   by 0.25 pp. This comes along with a decline in turnout of the same size
   in both elections.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the role of the religious factor in the
   context of the socio-political development of modern societies against
   the background of military-political confrontation. The ongoing
   processes are an-alyzed at several levels - national, international, and
   ecclesiastical. Utilizing the post-secular paradigm, as well as actor
   and identitarian approaches, the authors examine the religious dimension
   of the Ukrainian crisis. They draw a particular attention to the
   situation in the world Orthodox Christianity. The authors reveal the
   reasons why the main line of cleavage in the modern Chris-tianity formed
   precisely in its Orthodox segment and was closely intertwined with the
   largest international political crisis of the first quarter of the 21st
   cen-tury. The article shows that the Ukrainian crisis has a
   destabilizing effect on the situation in the world Orthodox
   Christianity, reactivating old conflicts and creating new sources of
   tension. Having stated that the Ukrainian crisis served as a trigger and
   catalyst for dynamics in different spheres, covering a significant
   number of different types 113{''}\& Pcy;\& Ocy;\& Lcy;\& Icy;\& Tcy;\&
   Icy;\& YAcy;{''}No 2 (113) 2024of actors, the authors at the same time
   point out that socio-political develop-ment in the context of the
   religious factor has deeper roots. From their view-point, the observed
   phenomena and processes indicate the formation of new models of
   interaction between the state, society and church within the frame-work
   of post-secular or traditionalist discourse, which in turn is associated
   with the rapid establishment of a new scientific and technological
   order. According to the authors' conclusion, as it already happened many
   times in history, the religious factor is obtaining key importance in
   determining the basic features of the new era. The transformation of
   Modernity into something else, which is taking place before our eyes,
   does not result in the ``elimination{''} of this factor, but, on the
   contrary, transforms religious factor into an impor-tant component of
   the formula for a new way of life. The Ukrainian conflict intensifies
   the search for post-secular models of socio-political development in the
   Western political areal. At the same time, Russia and the West itself
   are moving in different ways, since the Russian model is closer to
   pre-secular practices.},

Title = {OFFICIAL DISCOURSE OF NATION-BUILDING IN THE POST-SOVIET SPACE: THE
   CASES OF RUSSIA, KAZAKHSTAN AND BELARUS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},

Pages = {7-22},
Abstract = {The article analyzes the official discourse of nation-building in three
   post-Soviet states - Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus. The process of
   ``nationalization{''} of new states is not completed, and the analysis
   of authority discourse enables to evaluate how national elites, after
   gaining independence, choose the vector of nation-building and form a
   nationalist discourse. The purpose of the article is to identify common
   and specific features in the official discourse of nation-building. The
   hypothesis is that there is a common discursive base that links the
   trajectories of this process, as well as a specificity determined by the
   peculiarities of post-Soviet nation-building in each country. The study
   had for empirical basis the official messages of the presidents of the
   states and doctrinal documents in the field of national policy. Six
   nation-building discourses were identified, four of which - the civic,
   polyethnic, civilizational and sovereignty discourses - are common,
   ethnic discourse is present in Kazakhstan and Belarus, neo-imperial
   discourse - in Russia. The major coincidences are present in civic,
   polyethnic discourses and the discourse of sovereignty, and this makes
   it possible to record the presence of a common discursive base, although
   semantic articulations differ in each state. The most significant
   differences are observed within the civilizational discourse; in each
   state, civilizational orientations are determined by attempts to
   construct an image of its unique history and culture. Ethnic discourses
   in Kazakhstan and Belarus are not semantically identical, although they
   are built around the main theme for ethnonationalism - the theme of
   language. In Kazakhstan, this topic is highly politicized; in Belarus,
   it is part of a cultural policy, due to which the issue of
   ``indigenous{''} and ``non-indigenous{''} populations has been moved
   deeply to the periphery of the socio-political process. The main feature
   of Russian discourse is in this study the explicit neo-imperial
   discourse, which, on the one hand, emphasizes the state-imperial
   character of the Russian people, and on the other, strengthens the
   discourse of sovereignty.},

Abstract = {The initial public offerings (IPO) phenomenon remains one of the most
   nebulous and sophisticated issues in the financial industry. Numerous
   studies in different countries provide significant evidence by
   addressing various aspects of underpricing of IPOs. Information
   asymmetry between investors and issuers is a prominent reason for the
   extent of underpricing. Issuers tend to disclose more information to
   reach a fair equilibrium price in the market. Hedging instruments are
   the most widely used financial risk management tools that can decrease
   information asymmetry. The relationship between corporate derivatives
   use and information asymmetry has been investigated through value
   relevance channels in secondary markets. However, researchers have
   recently started to analyse the impact of hedging using various markets,
   such as debt markets, mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs. Moreover,
   increasing interest in real assets and initial public offerings due to a
   high inflationary environment can provide further evidence for IPO
   underpricing, especially in emerging markets. For this purpose, this
   study investigates the impact of financial risk management using
   financial derivatives on short-term IPO performance (i.e., IPO
   underpricing) in the Turkish IPO market. Employing a sample of 287
   Turkish IPOs between 2008 and 2023, we find that financial derivatives
   use negatively affects the level of IPO underpricing.},

Title = {Coping With Turbulence and Safeguarding Against Authoritarianism:
   Polycentric Governance as a Resilience Resource},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Crisis management during the pandemic stimulated a bulk of analyses and
   debates on how states and societies coped with this challenge. In many
   countries, authority migrated temporarily from parliaments to executives
   and from the subnational to the national level, involving even
   violations of democratic and individual rights. Such reactions are
   motivated by the assumption that crisis management requires prompt,
   decisive, and uniform responses best delivered by a strong and
   centralised leadership. In contrast to this widespread assumption,
   crisis and disaster management research compellingly stresses the
   virtues of polycentric governance and processes based on flexibility,
   decentrality, and dispersed information in coping with turbulence. In
   this article, a framework is proposed for analysing empirically the
   question of what makes states and societies resilient. Core to this
   framework is the notion of resilience resources. In linking resilience
   resources to properties of socio-ecological systems and their reactions
   to turbulence, the resilience concept becomes accessible to empirical
   analyses. The potential of the framework is illustrated by an empirical
   example of the coordination of decentralised pandemic management by the
   German Minister-Presidents' Conference. This example shows how the
   resilience resource of polycentric governance is put into practice. The

Title = {THE VIEW OF OFFENSIVE REALISM AND LIBERALISM ON U.S. FOREIGN POLICY},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-35},
Abstract = {. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States of America has
   pursued an offensive foreign policy. In the realities of the 2010s and
   2020s, marked by mounting resistance to American global dominance,
   primarily from Russia and China, there are prerequisites for the
   adjustment of the U.S. foreign policy strategy. The aim of the article
   is to identify the underlying causes of offensiveness in U.S. foreign
   policy of the post-bipolar period based on theoretical constructs of
   offensive realism and liberalism. Research has shown that offensive
   realism and offensive liberalism can help understand the offensive
   nature of U.S. foreign policy after 1991 in their own way and make
   appropriate projections for the future. Based on the tenets of offensive
   realism, it can be assumed that the collapse of the Soviet Union and
   communism have created an enabling environment for maximizing the power
   of the United States, which Washington could not but leverage.
   Witnessing the dwindling U.S. power potential, as well as the
   strengthening of China and Russia in the 2010s - 2020s, Washington has
   not stopped acting in the logic of offensive realism, but under the
   Trump and Biden administrations it has definitely began to move towards
   defensive realism. As the rivals to the US continue to strengthen their
   capacities, this trend can only intensify. Following the tenets of
   offensive liberalism, it is possible to assume that after the Cold War,
   the power of the United States has turned out to be so great in
   comparison with other great and major powers that Washington has begun
   to offensively build an American liberal hegemony, letting power rivalry
   falls by the wayside. However, due to the weakening of the U.S. power
   potential, as well as the simultaneous rise of China and Russia, it has
   been forced to begin a transition to a strategy based on offensive and
   defensive realism under the Trump and Biden administrations. If its
   rivals continue to rise, the U.S. may turn away from offense altogether.},

Title = {THE VISION OF ENERGY SECURITY BY KEY POWER CENTERS (RUSSIA, CHINA, USA,
   AND THE EU)},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {The 2020s have witnessed increasing instability in energy security. The
   COVID-19 pandemic, which profoundly impacted the global economy and
   energy industry; the fierce confrontation between Russia and the West
   overthe war in Ukraine, which has significantlydisrupted global energy
   supplies; the ongoing tensions of tensions in the hydrocarbon-rich
   Middle East; and imbalances arising from the fourth energy transition
   are among the key factors destabilizing the global energy supply system,
   resulting in high volatility in energy prices. Countries' approaches to
   energy security remain largely conventional, focusing on three core
   aspects: security of energy supply, energy independence, and security of
   energy demand. This study comprehensively analyzes the current
   understanding of energy security by Russia, China, the USA, the EU,
   based on their fundamental doctrinal documents. The findings indicate
   that Russia, as a self-sufficient country and major energy exporter,
   views its energy security through the lenses of security of energy
   demand, security of energy supply, and energy independence. China
   prioritizes security of energy supply and strives for energy
   independence amid the energy transition, a natural approach given its
   critical dependence on hydrocarbon imports and status as the world's
   largest source of greenhouse gases. The United States, despite becoming
   a net oil and gas exporter, continues to prioritize security of energy
   supply and energy independence, with an increasing emphasis on security
   of energy demand. The European Union, critically dependent on
   hydrocarbon imports, focuses primarily on security of energy supply and
   energy independence within the context of the energy transition. While
   Russia, China, the US, and the EU predominantly view energy security
   defensively, the US and the EU also adopt an offensive stance. Unlike
   China, the US, the EU, and Russia politicize their understanding of
   energy security. Despite this, Russia and China demonstrate openness to
   international energy cooperation, whereas the US and the EU are more
   inclined to promote their energy sector interests through confrontation.},

Title = {Art Speech in the Case Law of the Spanish Constitutional Court: An
   Autonomous Right with its own Legal Regime},
Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {53},
Abstract = {The analysis of the decisions of the Constitutional Court on freedom of
   artistic creation shows that it is a freedom whose recognition and
   constitutional regime is being forged in recent decades. Taking into
   account this context, there has been an evolution in the constitutional
   case -law that has gone from considering it part of freedom of speech to
   conceiving it as an autonomous freedom. Although this evolution has not
   been linear or clear, in a double and relevant sense. On the one hand,
   the transition towards an autonomous freedom has not been reasoned or
   armed with a minimum load of arguments and, to this day, the Court's
   position regarding the scope of this freedom is still not crystal clear.
   On the other hand, the autonomy of the freedom of artistic creation with
   respect to freedom of speech should lead to the design of a minimum
   constitutional regime differentiated with respect to the latter, which
   has not been pointed out by the Constitutional Court. This article
   analyzes in detail the described evolution of the constitutional case
   -law in relation to the freedom of artistic creation, evaluating the
   different options of the constitutional jurisprudence.},

Title = {Backsliding Populist Governments in the Council: The Case of the
   Hungarian Fidesz},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Populist governments aim to fundamentally challenge the EU, raising the
   question of when and how backsliding populist governments disrupt
   decision-making in the Council of the EU (hereafter Council). Due to
   their anti-elite and strong anti-EU stance, along with their opposition
   to core values of liberal democracy, I argue that these governments are
   more inclined to resort to unpolitics, , understood as
   ``unsettlement.{''} Analysing the behaviour of the Hungarian Fidesz
   government in the Council, the article demonstrates that populist
   governments resort to unpolitics but use an \& agrave; la carte
   approach. Populist backsliding governments selectively oppose the
   Council's formal and informal decision-making rules. Looking at the
   voting behaviour in the Council since 2009, the article shows that the
   Fidesz government preserves the norm of consensus. However, over time,
   it has become the government that has most often broken with this norm.
   Conversely, when it comes to ``backsliding-inhibiting competences,{''}
   the Fidesz government challenges both formal and informal rules through
   a wide range of strategies, i.e., systematically contesting the legality
   of procedures and decisions, embracing a confrontational approach and
   diplomacy, self-victimisation, bending the truth, and accusatory
   rhetoric. To illustrate them, the article focuses on decisions related
   to the dismantlement of the rule of law in the country, such as Article
   7 TEU, the application of Regulation 2020/2092, and the disbursement of
   Cohesion funds.},

Abstract = {Based on an ethnography of French trials for trafficking in human beings
   and aggravated procuring, this article seeks to contribute to the
   analysis of the reframing, in penal terms, of the struggles engaged in
   the name of social justice and women's rights, of which anti-trafficking
   policies are particularly emblematic. Studying the judging practices and
   logics at stake during trials reveals how fantasized representations of
   the pimp and the victim take on substance. In particular, I argue that
   judges invoke a set of gendered, sexualized and racialized extra-legal
   norms, which, along with their legal foundations, constitute their
   knowledge base and impose a moral and penal hierarchy among litigants.
   Therefore, not only does this analysis contribute to defining the
   contours of the elusive figures of the pimp and the victim in the penal
   arena, it also exposes how maintaining public order is based on the
   perpetuation of a gendered and sexual national order in the name of
   gender justice.},

Title = {Why Do Non-Resident Citizens Get Elected? Candidates' Electoral Success
   in Ecuadorian Extraterritorial Districts},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {To the growing literature on non -resident citizens' special
   representation, we contribute with a systematic examination of the role
   of descriptive representation of citizens living abroad in elections for
   extraterritorial districts. Using data for the 308 candidacy
   observations in three two-seat extraterritorial districts in five
   legislative elections held between 2007 and 2021 in Ecuador, for a total
   of 30 seats, we test four hypotheses related to the electoral rules,
   party-level, and socio-demographic factors of non -resident candidates.
   Ecuadorian non -resident candidates benefit from their incumbency
   position and party affiliation, along with left-wing ideological
   ascription and belonging to party organizations that pushed for voting
   rights abroad and that manifest an interest in emigrant issues. This
   article contributes to showing what gets emigrants elected in
   extraterritorial seats and offers a within-country comparison connecting
   elections with legislative politics across national borders.},

Abstract = {Kyrgyzstan President Sadyr Japarov came to power in 2020 on a wave of
   populist mobilisation. This was a democratic moment of popular
   resistance against corrupt elites. Once in office, he established a
   developmental dictatorship. The organs of repression act in the same way
   against corrupt oligarchs as they do against any kind of political
   opponent. So far, the belief that the confiscated assets and the profits
   from the nationalized Kumtor gold mine will be used for the benefit of
   the poor segments of the population that carried Japarov into office.
   However, there is a great danger that this regime will also channel
   public funds into its own accounts. There is hardly any criticism from
   Western states, as they are primarily interested in getting the Central
   Asian states on their side in the conflict with Russia.},

Title = {Negative consequences of the androcentric organization of politics in
   male parliamentarians from provinces with an extensive history of gender
   parity laws. The case of Córdoba, Argentina},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},

Abstract = {The aim of this research was to explore, from the perspective of male
   parliamentarians, the existence of changes in the androcentric
   organization of politics in representative systems with a long history
   of implementing gender parity laws, using the province of C \&
   oacute;rdoba (Argentina) as a case study. Twelve interviews were
   conducted with legislators from different parties, and thematic analysis
   was performed using Atlas.ti software. The findings indicated that in
   political systems influenced by gender parity laws, there are variations
   in male experiences concerning the persistent androcentric organization
   of politics. However, it was also found that, despite identifying the
   detrimental effects of this organization in their lives, men do not
   change their behavior. These results suggest that although gender parity
   laws have facilitated significant advances in the representation of
   women in the institutional political sphere, they have not managed to
   transform the organizational structure designed to favor men and
   perpetuate gender inequality. Among the limitations of this study is its
   inability to be exhaustive in identifying and analyzing other negative
   consequences of the androcentric organization of politics that male
   parliamentarians may recognize, as well as in understanding the
   variability of male experiences in relation to this organization
   following the implementation of gender parity laws.},

   POLICY SHAPING},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The article explores the specific features of the UK strategic approach
   to policy towards Russia and China through the British establishment's
   perception of threats to national security. Based on the Intermestic
   Realism theoretical model, the author analyses how the broad domestic
   political discourse influences strategic tasks being formulated in
   foreign policy and vise versa. The demand for the protection of the
   democratic process as widely seen now to be threatened by authoritarian
   regimes, as well as the emphasis on the counteraction against some state
   actors, have brought about the emergence of new narratives in the UK.
   These trends affect decision-makers in the field of foreign policy, and
   retain the potential to influence strategic culture regardless of which
   party the Cabinet belongs to. In terms of the UK-Russia and UK-China
   relations, two trends are emerging, related to the discourse on
   malicious interference and attempts at foreign influence not only on
   electoral and democratic processes, but also on public opinion, and,
   consequently, on the mainstream domestic political discourse. New law
   enforcement practices formulated in response to these challenges, on the
   one hand, provide some leeway in UK policy planning, and on the other
   hand, confine the policy only to a threat-centered discourse, creating
   long-term hard line towards Moscow and an increasingly less flexible
   approach towards Beijing.},

   IN THE 21ST CENTURY},
Journal = {REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE PENSAMIENTO POLITICO},
Year = {2024},
Number = {19},
Abstract = {The new governance model based on algorithms (algocracy) involves a
   substantial modification of the principles and procedures of modern
   representative democracy. The attributes of speed, probity, transparency
   and impartiality put forward by its supporters generate, in the opinion
   of its detractors, a radical decrease in citizen protagonism in the
   deliberative processes of politics, replacing the public discussion of
   these matters with automated procedures of statistical data analysis. .
   Faced with these positions of adhesion and rejection, the strengthening
   of public reason would sustain a modality of moderate algocracy that,
   along with restoring the relevance of citizen participation, is
   compatible with a democracy conceived fundamentally from a deliberative
   conception of it.},

Abstract = {This article explores government policies toward European integration in
   Georgia, Armenia, and Turkiye, focusing on their unique challenges.
   Despite public support, Georgia faced setbacks as the EU suspended its
   accession due to government stances and a policy design-implementation
   gap. Turkiye, hindered by internal human rights issues and freedom
   restrictions, faces policy conflicts stemming from political turbulence
   and EU criticisms. Armenia's situation is complex, Armenia seeks EU
   alignment through democratic reforms while maintaining ties with Russia
   but faces capacity and security challenges. The study presents detailed
   analyses of these three cases using document analysis and expert
   interviews.},

Abstract = {The article examines trade policy initiatives of the Biden
   administration. In a complex climate of domestic political polarization,
   the United States compete with China and defends its position in
   international markets. These challenges affect the areas of high
   technologies, digital economy, information and communications sector,
   renewable energy sources, and infrastructure. At the same time, an
   equally important problem in the context of increased geopolitical risks
   remains increasing the reliability of logistics and production chains,
   primarily for microelectronics. Addressing these challenges requires the
   creation of appropriate platforms that allow the United States to
   interact with partner countries. Within these frameworks, the United
   States intends to promote the priorities of the Biden administration:
   standards in the field of high technologies, ensuring the energy
   transition, protecting working conditions and inclusion. Another crucial
   area is promoting the fight against corruption, ensuring transparency of
   business processes in partner countries and training personnel.
   Completing these goals should attract American business and investment
   to the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions and Latin America. These should
   also increase American leverage in its strategic competition with China.
   At the same time, the formats of cooperation created by the United
   States must be insured against their internal political situation and
   the risks of interruption of work when there is a change of presidential
   administrations. In less than four years of its work (2021-2024), the
   Biden administration has proposed three platforms: the Global
   Infrastructure and Investment Partnership, the Indo-Pacific Economic
   Framework for Prosperity, and the Partnership of the Americas for
   Economic Prosperity. The results of their implementation are different.
   This article examines the two last mentioned regional platforms and
   describes conditions for their creation, work prospects, probable risks,
   and some results.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE INVESTIGACIONES POLITICAS Y SOCIOLOGICAS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {This article deals with the electoral analysis of the 2024 autonomous
   elections in the Basque Country. Based on aggregate data, an assessment
   is made of the mobilisation patterns, the electoral evolution of the
   different competitors, the geographical distribution of their support
   and the main parameters of the party system and its basic continuity.
   The sample data from the CIS pre-election and post-election surveys, the
   post-election survey of the Basque Government's Gabinete de Prospecci \&
   oacute;n Sociol \& oacute;gica and the Euskobar \& oacute;metro database
   allow us to delve deeper into the factors that explain voting
   preferences, the moment of the voting decision and the reasons for it,
   ideological and identity polarisation, the characterisation of a
   competitive dynamic that is moderating and the raw volatility of voters.
   The particularity of these elections focused on the impact of the
   renewal of leaderships and, above all, the duel between the two main
   nationalist actors (PNV and EHB), without neglecting the settling of
   scores between the regional terminals of the national parties, called
   upon to complete the nationalist majorities in the face of a highly
   competitive horizon of alternation. To this end, the analysis has been
   completed with multiple linear regression models, the aim of which is to
   identify the factors that influence the assessment of the two main
   respective candidates (Pradales and Otxandiano) with a chance of
   winning.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the Constitutional Court's Order 177/2022, of
   December 19, which constitutes an unprecedented resolution by suspending
   the processing of two legislative amendments and preventing the Senate
   from fully exercising its legislative power in a legislative reform on
   the appointment of constitutional judges. The Constitutional Court
   allowed two judges to intervene in the deliberation and ruling on their
   own recusal, jeopardizing the right to an impartial court. In admitting
   the amparo appeal, the Constitutional Court issued a decision on the
   merits by paralyzing the legislative procedure with a lack of prudence
   and respect for parliamentary autonomy despite compliance with the
   Senate's Rules of Procedure and the guarantees of the rights of senators
   in the legislative procedure. The Constitutional Court has created a new
   way of prior review of constitutionality not contemplated in either the
   Constitution or the Constitutional Court Organic Law, authorizing each
   deputy or senator individually to request the Constitutional Court to
   suspend a bill parliamentary processing.},

Abstract = {This study explores the prevalence of conspiracy theories in political
   communication. The analysis reveals that conspiratorial political
   discourse deviates from non-conspiratorial discourse, displaying
   internal inconsistencies. Various subgroups within the conspiracy theory
   community have developed distinct ways of perceiving, classifying,
   attending, and assigning meaning to events. This study contends that the
   appeal of conspiracy theories is rooted in their cultural embeddedness.
   Utilising a dataset of tweets that mentioned, replied to, or were
   authored by Polish politicians and political parties, this study
   incorporates Thick Big Data by combining quantitative analysis with
   qualitative content analysis. The typology of conspiracy theories
   includes three levels based on their deviation from conventional
   knowledge. These levels have been empirically illustrated in the
   political context of Poland. This differentiation sheds light on the
   diffusion of political conspiracy theories, suggesting that the
   probability of adoption depends on the proximity to an individual's
   mindscape.},

Abstract = {This article undertakes a case study of social justice feminism through
   four criteria that influence the psyches of social movement
   participants: grievance, ideology, efficacy, and social embeddedness.
   The grievance lay with the Second Industrial Revolution. Social justice
   feminists used an ``entering wedge{''} strategy to promote and pass
   women's labor legislation to eventually secure state protection of all
   workers in the United States. The ideology of social justice feminism
   came from a combination of socialist-influenced thought and the
   promotion of social justice. The most important element of social
   justice feminism lay in its efficacy, involving social embeddedness.},

   attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure such as power plants and
   the electricity grid, in order to wear down the population. The delivery
   of Western air defence systems promises improvement. After heavy losses,
   both sides lack the reserves necessary to carry out offensive

Title = {Nicaragua and the ``Parallel Diplomacies{''}: Readings, Motivations, and
   Extraterritorial Activities of the Argentine Military (1977-1979)},
Journal = {DESAFIOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The turbulent situation in Nicaragua the late 1970s constituted a
   significant challenge for the military dictatorship in Argentina
   (1976-1983). Divided into often opposing sectors, they developed various
   eval - uations, found different motivations and, consequently, promoted
   different activities related to the Central American country. This
   article seeks to contribute to the broader debate on Argentine extrater
   - ritorial activities during the last dictatorship by focusing on the
   foreign relations between Nicaragua and Argentina (1977-1979) and
   delving into the motivations for said activities. It does so through the
   reading and detailed analysis of an extensive corpus of documents from
   the Argentine Foreign Ministry. I argue that among the variables that
   explain the ``erratic and contradictory{''} foreign policy towards
   Nicaragua, the type of diplomacy involved (military, economic or
   official) and the specific historical moment (before or after the
   Nicaraguan revolution) must be taken into account. This analysis stands
   in sharp contrast to previous works that analyze only one cause - the
   persecution of Argentine exiles in revolutionary Nicaragua - or only one
   sector of the Armed Forces - the nationalists or ``hardliners{''}.},

Abstract = {The article presents an original classification of patterns of
   transformation of party systems in EU countries under the influence of
   the institutionalization of a new post-industrial cleavage. Drawing on
   theories of cleavage and spatial competition and using party positioning
   databases, elec-toral indices and statistics, the author attempts to
   identify the main trajectories of the transformation of the European
   party systems between 1990 and 2023 and identify factors that explain
   the differences between them. The study identified five patterns
   associated with the effects of two key parameters. The first one is the
   structural specificity of the conditions of party competition in
   post-communist and other EU countries, associated with the difference
   between the old structured and new volatile party systems. The se-cond
   parameter is the type of a country's party-political system in
   accordance with Arend Lijphart's classification - either
   majoritarian-polarized or coali-tion-consensus. While under majoritarian
   system the institutionalization of a new cleavage often gave rise to a
   radical breakdown of the old configuration of parties with the emergence
   of powerful populist forces, under consensus sys-tem - a smooth increase
   in fragmentation with the outflow of votes in favor of various new
   parties and the complication of the process of forming coalitions. For a
   number of countries other factors, such as the level of socio-economic
   development, ethnocentricity of politics, the type of electoral system
   and the stability of the welfare state appeared relatively important. In
   contrast, hypoth-eses about the significance of the initial
   configuration of party systems, the timing of formation of new parties
   and the geographical proximity of countries were not confirmed.},

   {[}Anonymous], 4 Describing the precise mechanisms by which ONC builds up and sustains this consensus among stakeholders in health IT is the main object of this chapter. On ``building up{''} as a practice of reality-making in actor-network theory, see, John Law in After Method: Mess in Social Science Research (London; New York: Routledge, 2004), 94 and 160,. On stakeholder theory in political deliberation, organization management, and policy, see, R. Edward Freeman, Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach, Reissue (Cambridge New York Melbourne Madrid Cape Town Singapore: Cambridge University Press, 2010 {[}1984]). I apply a convergent approach to stakeholder theory, conceptualizing stakeholders who engage in health IT policy as operating with a shared set of professional norms, while also calling attention to the constructedness, fungibility, relational nature, and ultimate contingency of those norms. See, Thomas M. Jones and Andrew C. Wicks, ``Convergent Stakeholder Theory,{''} Academy of Management Review 24, no. 2 (April 1999): 206-21. A convergent approach to stakeholder theory has been applied thusly in health policy analysis, see, Sara Rubinelli and Per Maximilian von Groote, ``Stakeholder Dialogue as Deliberation for Decision Making in Health Policy and Systems: The Approach from Argumentation Theory,{''} American Journal of Physical Medicine Rehabilitation 96 (February 2017): S17-22. I augment this approach with insights from STS, infrastructure studies, and ANT, see especially: Kathrin M Cresswell, Allison Worth, and Aziz Sheikh, ``Actor-Network Theory and Its Role in Understanding the Implementation of Information Technology Developments in Healthcare,{''} BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 10, no. 1 (December 2010); Marc Berg, ``Accumulating and Coordinating: Occasions for Information Technologies in Medical Work,{''} Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) 8, no. 4 (December 1999): 373-401; R Stuart Geiger and David Ribes, ``Trace Ethnography: Following Coordination through Documentary Practices,{''} in 2011 44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (2011 44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2011), Kauai, HI: IEEE, 2011), 1-10; Volkmar Pipek and Volker Wulf, ``Infrastructuring: Toward an Integrated Perspective on the Design and Use of Information Technology{''} 10, no. 5 (May 2009): 447-73., DOI DOI 10.1177/09720634221078853.

Abstract = {The social impact of the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic
   has shown that we're not facing a mere infectious disease, but a
   neoliberal syndemic. This syndemic have stressed all the inequalities,
   oppressions and conflicts that were at the base of the neoliberal system
   of governance, contradictions that have reached a global dimension since
   the Great Recession (2008). In this article we will analyze the
   consequences of the neoliberal virus in different spheres (macro and
   micro) from a critical and materialistic perspective: from the
   management of the crisis by the States to the subjective transformations
   the syndemic has provoked in the population. Focusing in the Spanish
   case, we will go over the main reactions, narratives and struggles that
   have faced the covid crisis into what we understand as a new and more
   authoritarian phase of neoliberal capitalism. A phase that will need a
   radical articulation of social struggles to subvert a horizon that
   threatens with new oppressions.},

Title = {Cordons Sanitaires Against Authoritarian Reversals: Analysis of the
   Concept and Its Effects in the Case of Thuringia (2019/2020)},
Journal = {ANALECTA POLITICA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {26},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {This work aims to analyze the role of cordons sanitaires as a strategy
   to curb authoritarian reversals within democratic systems. To achieve
   this, the paper, after providing a brief review of conceptual
   discussions on cordons sanitaires, will present its own
   conceptualization. Subsequently, it will apply this conceptualization to
   a specific case (Thuringia, Germany, 2019/2020) and finally, engage in a
   discussion about the effects of cordons sanitaires. The central
   objective of this work is to discuss a conceptual approach to the
   phenomenon and exploratively analyze its possible application.
   Additionally, it seeks to outline a subsequent research agenda around
   two questions: Can the application of cordons sanitaires be a useful
   strategy to curb authoritarian reversals? Can these cordons sanitaires
   be contradictory to the democratic regime?},

Abstract = {Considering the relationship between state and society as the main area
   of thematic division of power ``over{''} and ``for{''}, the author shows
   the grounds that reveal that political domination is a certain form and
   stage of the historical evolution of political power, reflecting (in
   contrast to the democratic version of its development) the gradual
   usurpation by the ruling circles of their institutional (general civil)
   powers, truncation of citizens' rights and reduction of opportunities
   for their participation in government decision-making. In this context,
   the author, considering internal elite conflicts as the main source of
   such an evolution of power relations, draws attention to the so-called
   ``winning{''} coalition of the ruling class, which concentrated in its
   hands the main instruments of control over government decision-making
   and the distribution of key public goods and resources. At the same
   time, a complex set of functions and tasks for developing public policy
   goals, identifying privileged groups and maintaining social stability
   predetermines the identification of internal groupings of this elite
   stratum, allowing it to manage and construct social relations in
   accordance with the stated political course and its hidden intentions.
   In this context, the article identifies seven main segments of this
   ruling group, performing various tasks in the field of competition with
   rival groups of the ruling class and in the field of relations with
   society and structures of the civil sector. In this regard, the
   corresponding contradictions between individual segments of the
   ``winning{''} coalition are identified, as well as the technologies and
   mechanisms characteristic of these elite groups that contribute to the
   fulfillment of their role and support the format of political dominance.},

Abstract = {Conservative agenda is a fundamental component of the New Right politics
   in the public debate throughout the world. However, in Brazil, the
   conservative agenda has been advanced across the entire party system,
   from left to right, by new and old political parties. This paper
   compares proposals for constitutional amendments presented between 2001
   and 2022 by federal deputies in Brazil, focusing on targeted
   restrictions of rights and guarantees and the tightening of
   law-and-order provisions. The findings show that neither new-entrant
   parties nor ideology predict the saliency of conservative content in
   parties' constitutional activity. This analysis contributes to
   disentangling the conservative agenda from the concept of right-wing
   politics, even the New Right.},

Abstract = {This article is focused on two competing strains of legitimacy research
   in the European Union, taking as an example the discourse regarding the
   democratic deficit of the European Commission and the conceptualization
   of the EU as a regulatory state and not a democracy. The focus on the
   legitimacy of the European Commission is pressing due to the sudden rise
   in already established totalitarian tendencies in the European Union
   that were only hastened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper addresses
   the issue of how the European Commission is legitimizing itself when
   it's not composed of directly elected members, by engaging with the
   democratic deficit theory and the regulatory state theory. By exploring
   the perception of EU legitimacy, this article can further the debate on
   what nonstate actors and non-institutional actions can do to influence
   the EU's legitimacy and the future of its democracy.},

Abstract = {In its ``Memory Monitor 2023{''}, the Levada Centre examines historical
   awareness within Russian public opinion. The data provides insight into
   how Russia's culture of remembrance has changed since the collapse of
   the Soviet Union. However, the picture of history and society in Russia
   that author duo Lev Gudkov and Nataliia Zorkaia paints, is too strongly
   outlined in black and white. In fact, there are more shades of grey. You
   can only recognize them, however, if you take note of the counter-public
   sphere in Russia, which still exists to this day despite censorship and
   propaganda, and which is committed to a pluralistic view of history and
   efforts to come to terms with the past.},

Abstract = {Disinformation is a powerful means of manipulation in times of conflicts
   and war and fake news is a disinformation tool. The Russian Federation
   disseminates disinformation to support its military and foreign
   political goals. This article offers a theoretical contribution to
   exploring the role of intentions in disinformation strategies. In this
   research, we developed a FIRS model for detecting hidden disinformation
   strategies in fake news and attempted to identify the Russian
   disinformation strategy regarding Ukraine during the first year of the
   RF's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The article addresses the question
   of whether it is possible to comprehend the overall strategy of
   disinformation influence by reconstructing the intentions of fake news.
   Relying on intent analysis, intentions correlations analysis and
   intentions clustering method, the article highlights the RF's
   manipu-lative intentions, namely, discrediting Ukraine, discrediting the
   West, justification of the RF's actions, the RF's positive image and
   criticism of opponents, demonstration of the RF's power and intimidation
   of the opponents, accusing Ukraine and the West of nazism. The results
   demonstrate the systemic nature of the RF's disinformation strategies
   and their adaptation to the course of the war.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Despite growing attention to realism in political theory, there remains
   a notable gap in understanding how politicians adopt, interpret, or
   contest the realist approach. This gap is particularly striking given
   that realist theory fundamentally hinges upon grounding theoretization
   in the realities of politics. This article turns to the political
   discourse surrounding the war in Ukraine to examine the role of realist
   argumentation in justifying and guiding political action. In contrast to
   the rejection or critique of ideologies in contemporary realist theory,
   our analysis, adopting a morphological approach of the discourses
   articulated by Emmanuel Macron, Viktor Orb \& aacute;n, and Olaf Scholz,
   revealed the substantive and ideological nature of realism. Our findings
   underscore the potential for starting realist theorizing by considering
   the realities of political practice, namely that realism must be
   situated between fidelity to reality and the uncertainties of
   dissimulation.},

Abstract = {Our study examines if there are changes in psycholinguistic signals in
   between terror attacks. We selected 5 signals-belief in the ability to
   control events, need for power, need for affiliation, distrust of
   others, and view of the political universe. Speeches and press releases
   were collected from two terror groups, Hezbollah and Hamas, and were
   imputed into Profile Plus which collected the measures of the five
   psycholinguistic signals. We then measured the time between terror
   attacks inflicted by the two terror groups using survival analysis. A
   shorter time frame between terror attacks would suggest more activity by
   the terror group. By measuring the scores of the psycholinguistic
   signals and comparing them to the intervals between terror attacks, we
   hoped to establish a pattern that could help intelligence analysts
   prevent terrorism. Our research shows little connection between changes
   in psycholinguistic signals between terror attacks. However, it does
   show some significance in the presence of speech/no speech and the
   length of the time interval between terror attacks.},

Abstract = {Among the countries of South Asia, the majority of Muslims are from
   India. They make up the majority of India's minority population. This
   research examines how, despite the community's variety, systemic
   Islamophobia in India affects Muslims nationwide, specifically targeting

   cum-critical, this paper discusses the connection between Hindutva
   ideology and communal riots in India through an examination of Hindu
   communal organizations, the role of the media, and politics. It also
   includes case studies about the lived experiences of Indian Muslims, who
   have the legal right to be treated equally as citizens of a free India.},

   The path that lead him to start the journal was paved by his early years

   inexorably, towards genocide scholarship. From an early age he
   experienced the cruel capriciousness of identity politics, and in his
   academic career he studied its avarice and often grave consequences.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {785-800},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article revisits the problems of electoral democracy, especially
   affective polarisation, from the perspective of the theory of
   deliberative democracy. Some authors representing `realist' views of
   democracy have concluded that empirical findings regarding affective
   polarisation challenge not just the idea of representative democracy as
   responsive government but also the prospects for deliberative democracy.
   We point out certain problems and limitations in this conclusion and
   discuss how theories of deliberative democracy might actually help find
   remedies for affective polarisation. We apply a recent distinction by
   Hartman et al. as an intermediate-level conceptualisation that helps
   translate the theory of deliberative democracy into deliberative
   practices. To illustrate the potential of deliberative practices, we
   analyse how forums for citizen deliberation such as deliberative
   mini-publics could help counteract affective polarisation. We reflect on
   the strengths and weaknesses of deliberative forums from a systemic
   perspective.},

Abstract = {In response to declining membership, European parties have often moved
   to offering direct participation of members and/or non-members in
   leadership and candidate primaries. However, the consequences for party
   members remains unclear. This paper aims to address this issue by
   suggesting a new conceptual framework exploring the combined effect of
   the degree of inclusiveness of the two key formal dimensions of ``who
   can run{''} and ``who can vote{''} in intra-party primaries and their
   joint positive or negative effect on party membership size, attitude
   toward the leadership and turnout during the primary. Based on secondary
   and new pre- and post-primary party membership surveys data and in-depth
   membership interviews, the paper qualitatively and comparatively studies
   primaries within the UK Conservatives, the German Greens and the French
   Parti Socialiste. It finds that mainly primaries limited to members
   combined with permissive candidate requirements have potentially
   positive consequences for parties, attracting citizens back to parties,
   leading to higher participation and membership satisfaction. Thus, the
   paper contributes to the understanding of the consequences of party
   reforms for parties and party members.},

Abstract = {Research on political parties and social movements has long developed
   independently, separated by the disciplinary boundaries of political
   science and sociology. We see the recent successes of `movement parties'
   as a push to bridge the two disciplinary traditions in order to describe
   this new hybrid party type accurately. To this end, we ask to what
   extent and under what conditions do we observe movement parties in
   European party systems, and how can we define the various subtypes? In
   the introduction to the special issue, we make three contributions.
   First, we identify existing definitions and empirical examples in the
   study of movement parties based on a systematic review of the emerging
   literature. Second, we operationalize Herbert Kitschelt's influential
   definition of lower levels of programmatic and organizational investment
   coupled with a higher degree of protest mobilization. Third, we
   introduce the individual contributions to the special issue and situate
   them within the relevant theoretical debates. Utilizing a new set of
   quantitative indicators, we empirically assess how parties identified as
   movement parties in the existing literature score on programmatic,
   organizational, and protest dimensions. The analysis underscores the
   heterogeneity of movement parties, with only a few cases aligning with
   Kitschelt's comprehensive definition.},

Title = {Quality of government and public support for taxation for climate change
   mitigation: evidence from 135 European regions},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 16},
Abstract = {Recent studies suggest that value orientations, both pro-environmental
   values and concerns and left-right ideology, strongly predict climate
   policy support in some settings, but not in others, and that
   institutional quality determines the strength of these associations.
   These studies are based on a limited number of countries and do not
   investigate the mechanisms at work nor what aspects of quality of
   government (QoG) matter more specifically. Analyzing data from 135
   European regions across 15 countries, this paper finds that QoG
   moderates the relationships of pro-environmental values and left-right
   ideology with climate tax support and suggests that political trust is
   an underlying individual-level mechanism. Moreover, corruption seems to
   be the most important aspect of QoG for policy support. In regions where
   corruption is prevalent and trust in state institutions is low, support
   for climate taxes is low even among those who are generally concerned
   about the environment and climate change and who favor state
   intervention. The study suggests additional analyses, adopting
   quantitative and qualitative approaches, to inform policymakers on how
   to increase public support for climate taxation and improve policy
   designs to mitigate policy concerns across various segments of the
   population.},

Title = {Conflicting Institutional Pressures During the Establishment of Tax
   Administrations in the Post-1990 Eastern German States},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 14},
Abstract = {The reunification of Germany in 1990 has been extensively analysed, yet
   little knowledge exists on how this critical period has impacted
   Germany's system of tax administration. Drawing upon document analysis
   and semi-structured interviews with experts who were personally involved
   in the transition, this article investigates the key challenges faced
   during the establishment of tax administration infrastructures in the
   post-1990 eastern German states. Specifically, the article compares the
   transition process in two eastern German states, Saxony and
   Saxony-Anhalt, thereby illuminating how early administrative design
   choices explain subsequent differences between these states in their
   post-1990 tax administration performance. The article employs an
   historical institutional perspective, combined with an isomorphic
   institutional analysis, demonstrating that the institutional
   configuration of Germany's system of tax administration is central to
   understanding the performance of eastern German tax administrations
   post-reunification. Conflicting interests between government actors,
   both vertically and horizontally, resulted in different views as to how
   the eastern German states' tax systems should be developed. Whilst the
   reunification brought these institutional tensions to the surface in a
   uniquely clear manner, these tensions continue to affect Germany's
   present tax administration, making this study important from a
   historical perspective but also to better understand Germany's
   contemporary system of fiscal administration.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the reaction of the European extreme right, with
   reference to the French and Italian ones, to the Yugoslav wars. The
   focus is on both parliamentary and extra-parliamentary groups and
   movements and their reaction, especially to the Serbo-Croatian conflict.
   Detailed analyses are reserved for both the majority of the movements
   that took pro-Croatian positions and the pro-Serbian minority. The
   latest case of the pro-Serbs is politically interesting because it
   intersects with the birth of the neo-Eurasian movement in the vicinity
   of the Soviet collapse. Different types of political and military
   support to the parties to the conflict are examined, and particular
   attention is paid to the phenomenon of foreign fighters.},

Abstract = {Analysing the effects of digital transformation on politics is a vast
   and fast-growing research field. We contribute to this research by
   assessing how party members perceive enforced digitalisation during the
   COVID-19 pandemic and how this affected their (non-)participation. Based
   on the DigiPM party member survey data, we investigate how individuals
   perceived participating in their organisations and how they dealt with
   peculiarities through the pandemic. The study provides insights into how
   the pandemic as an external shock is processed within parties and the
   role that routinised party-internal practices play in this regard.
   Methodologically, the article draws on bivariate analysis and
   multivariate regression models to explain stable member activity during
   the pandemic. Through this analysis, we contribute to the discussion on
   party membership change and the digital transformation of party
   organisations. Our analyses confirm the assumptions that the pandemic
   enforced digitalisation in German parties and changed party members'
   engagement. Further, the results draw attention to the importance of
   intra-party socialisation for member participation.},

Abstract = {The emergence of new digital tools has brought about a revolution in
   party organizations. However, the literature is still lacking
   comparative studies that utilize comprehensive theoretical frameworks
   and consider variations in the supply-side of party digitalization. This
   paper addresses both shortcomings by turning the spotlight on party
   websites. By relying on data from the Political Party Database, we delve
   into the determinants of website functionalities across a spectrum of
   diverse political parties. Our findings underscore that parties with
   less centralized leadership and affiliated to the left of the
   ideological spectrum tend to display websites with a broader range of
   functions. Moreover, younger parties also tend to present more complex
   websites, although this effect is mitigated by their electoral strength.
   Notably, a common thread among most parties is the use of their websites
   for mobilizing human and financial resources, while interactive features
   remain less prevalent.
   Das Aufkommen neuer digitaler Instrumente hat zu einer Revolution in
   Parteiorganisationen gef \& uuml;hrt. In der Literatur fehlt es jedoch
   an vergleichenden Studien, die einen umfassenden theoretischen Rahmen
   verwenden und Unterschiede auf der Angebotsseite der
   Parteiendigitalisierung ber \& uuml;cksichtigen. Der vorliegende Beitrag
   behebt beide Forschungsl \& uuml;cken, indem er die Webseiten von
   Parteien in den Mittelpunkt r \& uuml;ckt. Auf der Grundlage von Daten
   aus der Political Party Database untersuchen wir die Determinanten der
   Website-Funktionalit \& auml;ten in einem Spektrum verschiedener
   politischer Parteien. Wir zeigen, dass Parteien mit einer weniger
   zentralisierten F \& uuml;hrung und Parteien, die innerhalb des
   ideologischen Spektrums eher links angesiedelt sind, dazu neigen,
   Websites mit einem breiteren Spektrum an Funktionen anzubieten. Au ss
   erdem pr \& auml;sentieren j \& uuml;ngere Parteien tendenziell
   komplexere Websites, obwohl dieser Effekt durch ihre Wahlst \& auml;rke
   abgeschw \& auml;cht wird. Ein gemeinsamer Nenner der meisten Parteien
   ist die Nutzung ihrer Webseiten zur Mobilisierung personeller und
   finanzieller Ressourcen, w \& auml;hrend interaktive Funktionen nach wie
   vor weniger verbreitet sind.

Title = {Geographies of discontent: Public service deprivation and the rise of
   the far right in Italy},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 5},
Abstract = {Electoral support for far-right parties is often linked to geographies
   of discontent. We argue that public service deprivation, defined as
   reduced access to public services, plays an important role in explaining
   these patterns. By exploiting an Italian reform that reduced access to
   public services in municipalities with fewer than 5,000 residents, we
   show that far-right support in national elections increased in
   municipalities affected by the reform compared to unaffected ones. We
   use geo-coded individual-level survey data and party rhetoric data to
   explore the mechanisms underlying this result. Our findings suggest that

Title = {Populism and democratic attitudes: Comparing populist and non-populist
   candidates' views on democracy and its alternatives},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 5},
Abstract = {The rise of new populist parties has raised concerns for representative
   political systems and the quality of democracies, by challenging the
   liberal checks and balances in the name of the `general will'. Empirical
   research has found that populist voters tend to be more dissatisfied
   with democracy and supportive of direct procedures, while feelings of
   misrepresentation increase the display of populist attitudes. However,
   it remains unclear whether this also applies to candidates. This study
   investigates the differences in democratic attitudes of candidates from
   populist and non-populist parties, relying on data from the Comparative
   Candidates Survey. It explores the factors that account for diverging
   attitudes, particularly regarding party- and individual-level
   mechanisms. Results suggest that populist candidates tend to reveal
   lower levels of democratic satisfaction and more negative attitudes
   towards elections, as well as stronger preferences for direct
   procedures. These findings have significant implications for both
   populist studies and the field of political representation.},

Abstract = {Hedging is an essentially contested concept. Originally borrowed from
   the discipline of economics, it has become prevalent in the discourse on
   policy prescription in the Asia-Pacific. It is most often referenced
   with regard to geopolitical challenges of great power contestation faced
   by secondary powers in Northeast and Southeast Asia. Hedging is often
   regarded as a strategy to maintain relevance and autonomy in the face of
   competition between the United States and China. This article
   investigates the prevalence of hedging in the East Asian region,
   followed by a case analysis of Gaya. The author offers policy
   recommendations based on insights gained from ancient Gaya. He argues
   that, like the polities of the Gaya confederacy, contemporary
   second-tier states in the Asia-Pacific should cooperate closely, with
   the common objective of navigating the US-China rivalry. By ensuring
   their survival and prosperity, they can also contribute to the
   development of a geopolitical environment characterised by
   ``co-existence{''}.},

Abstract = {This article uses Arash Abizadeh to illustrate the appeal and
   difficulties of the claim that random selection is a more democratic way
   to select a legislature than election. It agrees with Abizadeh that
   representative democracy cannot be reduced to the right of voters to
   choose their legislators. However, it challenges his view that elections
   are inherently inegalitarian because they enable voters to discriminate
   unfairly among electoral candidates and his assimilation of gyroscopic
   to descriptive representation. Finally, the article highlights the
   difficulties of justifying random selection while rejecting election on
   egalitarian grounds. It therefore concludes that democratic equality
   requires more, not less, attention to the ethics of voting and to the
   conceptual, moral, and political dimensions of citizens' claims on
   elected office.},

Abstract = {Technological and technical advances, especially digital ones, have
   accelerated social transformations and have led to a change in the
   social, political and cultural paradigm. The interface society refers to
   this new social paradigm. This concept alludes to the idea of Guy
   Debord's spectacle society, as well as the assimilation and integration
   of information and communication technologies, both digital and virtual,
   in the daily life of human beings in contemporary industrial societies.
   Digital information and data, images, social networks are conquering our
   daily reality, conditioning and articulate the human subjectivity, as
   well as the subject's way of relating to himself and his environment.
   Understanding how technology comes up the human being and globalized
   societies is key to understand them, as well as to comprehend our
   historical moment.},

Abstract = {We use Facebook page `likes' in political elections to examine whether
   social media engagement can predict political candidates' campaign
   success. We find that for every one percentage point increase in the
   electoral district share of Facebook likes that a candidate receives,
   their vote share is predicted to increase by 0.09 percentage points. The
   positive estimated effect of social media engagement on vote share is
   robust to the potential confounding influence of unobserved factors.
   Facebook like data correctly predicts the outcome in just under
   two-thirds of seats, while two competing predictors of electoral success
   established in the prior literature - candidates' attractiveness and
   competence ratings - only predict slightly more than 50 per cent of
   seats. The findings suggest that social media users' engagement can be
   used to help inform election outcomes.},

Abstract = {Throughout the period of post-colonial development of the countries of
   the Western Sahel, these polities have been facing a multitude of
   challenges in socioeconomic, environmental and political spheres, among
   which the rising scarcity of water and the corresponding degradation of
   agricultural lands and pastures has been gaining in prominence. The
   paper aims to analyse the causes and implications of a relatively new
   phenomenon for this region - the escalation of armed hostilities between
   herders and farmers, who until a few decades ago coexisted peacefully,
   over access to arable lands, pastures and sources of water. In
   particular, the authors focus on the impact of the `water problem',
   which lies at the nexus of water scarcity and misguided and
   discriminatory government policies, on the socio-political situation in
   the Western Sahel, and find that it has become a key factor of regional
   destabilisation, fuelling not only farmer-herder conflicts, but also
   Islamist insurgencies.},

Abstract = {This essay examines June Jordan's design writings to elaborate a
   political theory of redesign in her work. I show that Jordan's redesign
   offers political principles for reimagining space at multiple scales and
   speaks to the question of how more livable, beautiful worlds may be
   wrought from the material contexts in which we presently live. Against
   the grain of the dismantling of public goods in the late twentieth
   century, Jordan re-envisioned public city spaces and housing with
   dignity and room for human flourishing. Her primary barometer for design
   was the fullest expression of human aliveness-she insisted that the
   built environment should ``{[}cherish] as it amplifies the experience of
   being alive.{''} Jordan's visionary pragmatism anticipates what Deva
   Woodly calls the ``radical Black feminist pragmatism{''} of the
   twenty-first century's Movement for Black Lives and speaks to
   contemporary abolitionist thought and struggles over the future of
   public goods.},

Abstract = {The article sheds light on the detrimental impact of foreign
   ``information disorder{''} campaigns on social media. It emphasizes how
   they can fuel violence, civil unrest, and coups in weak rule-of-law
   regions. It highlights explicitly Russian influence operations through
   social media in Mali and Burkina Faso from 2020 to 2022, addressing a
   gap in the literature on information disorder campaigns and non-kinetic
   hybrid threats in Africa. The study, employing desk reviews, content
   analysis, and semi-structured interviews, uncovered how foreign actors
   manipulated the target audience to disrupt social and political
   dynamics. These actions could have incited a campaign to overthrow the
   established order in Mali and Burkina Faso.},

Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 6},
Abstract = {Crises transform the temporal orientation of political decision-making.
   They demand immediate and decisive action and thus convert time into a
   means of political control. In these circumstances, assessing the
   long-term consequences of proposed policies with respect to welfare,
   sustainability or justice also becomes demanding. Yet crisis conditions
   may also contain of elements that can enable positive postcrisis
   societal changes. Crises can offer opportunities for new developmental
   measures and building a better future-something political leaders may
   capitalise on in their agenda-setting. By analysing the programmes of
   the post-2014 Finnish and Swedish governments, this paper seeks to make
   sense of how the current crisis mode has shaped these countries'
   politics in terms of their temporal horizons. The analysis focuses on
   three main perspectives or forms of articulation-innovative
   stabilisation, long-termism and synchronisation-by way of which these
   governments seek to navigate through crises-afflicted times and offer a
   desirable future direction for their respective societies. The analysis
   offers important insights into the (unused) potential of crises to
   achieve something substantially novel in the Nordic and European
   political landscape, ultimately advancing the conditions for a
   future-regarding democratic system.},

Abstract = {The EU's trade agreements with third countries exhibit varying degrees
   of alignment with intra-EU rules. What factors explain this external
   differentiation? This article answers this question by relying on a
   large language model to measure the alignment of 62 EU trade agreements
   with intra-EU rules at the level of individual topics, such as trade in
   goods, intellectual property rights, or sustainable development. The
   results indicate that this alignment is higher for third countries (1)
   with large trade flows with the EU; (2) with an EU membership
   perspective; and (3) with a medium level of regulatory capacity. These
   associations are particularly pronounced for provisions tackling
   behind-the-border trade barriers. These findings contribute to the
   literature on external differentiation and advance our understanding of
   EU trade policy and preferential trade agreements.},

Title = {In defence of taking offence: a reply to critics},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 3},
Abstract = {This article replies to the insightful contributions to the book
   symposium for On Taking Offence, These range from theoretical questions
   about how we should conceptualise an emotion like offence and the role
   of empirical evidence when justifying it, to practical questions about
   who has the power to take offence effectively and how to dispute
   another's offence-taking. In this reply, I first defend offence as a
   distinct emotion. Second, I argue against the implicit conception of
   social standing that underpins some of these challenges, as static and
   fixed rather than dynamic, emerging from the particularities of
   particular social interactions, and easily threatened. Third, I address
   the instrumental justification of offence. I conclude with some
   unanswered questions, and some reasons to remain optimistic about what
   taking offence can do.},

Journal = {MONTHLY REVIEW-AN INDEPENDENT SOCIALIST MAGAZINE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {76},
Number = {6},
Pages = {33-39},

Abstract = {What is often missed in literary debates regarding meaning or intent is
   the value of fiction as a tool for understanding social reality, rather
   than fiction as merely a puzzle to be cracked. While such debates can
   illuminate a work's historical or autobiographical context, nailing down
   a clear and singular meaning is particularly limiting when dealing with
   texts as enigmatic as those of Franz Kafka. For the purpose of a
   sociological analysis, one should bear in mind that Kafka's stories, as
   Walter Benjamin says, ``are not parables, and yet they do not want to be
   taken at their face value; they lend themselves to quotation and can be
   told for purposes of clarification.{''}1 That is, the rich social
   dynamics within Kafka's stories can be used illustratively-and in a
   larger context-without one falling into such extremes of a single
   symbolic meaning or mere fantasy devoid of larger consequential content.
   Kafka's often nightmarish stories reflect many of the social, political,
   and cultural dynamics inherent under capitalism. Drawing these elements
   out of his work helps to enrich not only our appreciation of Kafka, but
   our understanding of the world we interact with and of which we are an
   integral part.},

   democratic transition (1990-2022)},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 30},
Abstract = {A broad literature in the field of political science is dedicated to
   clarifying the link between economic variables and public opinion on the
   current government. In this study, we undertake a microanalysis using
   individual-level data to evaluate the relationship between economic
   perceptions and government approval in Chile, a transitional democracy.
   Unlike the previous research on new or transitional democracies, our
   analysis spans approximately 30 years (1990-2022), capturing significant
   events and stages of the democratization process. Utilizing data from
   the CEP survey, we find that Chileans, on average, prioritize the
   national economy over their own economic circumstances when evaluating
   government performance. In addition, our study suggests that following a
   major constitutional reform that eradicated key vestiges of the
   dictatorship, the impact of the country's economic perceptions on
   government approval experiences a notable decline. This suggests that
   conclusions about popularity functions in new or transitional
   democracies can change depending on period analyzed, especially during
   significant institutional changes in democratic consolidation.},

Abstract = {Redistricting is the causal agent responsible for two incumbents facing
   off in U.S. House elections and hence, despite the rarity of these
   matchups, they occur periodically due to district boundary changes. In
   this article, we examine who wins a recent and highly competitive
   incumbent duel: the 2024 GOP primary in Alabama's congressional district
   (CD) 1. Our assessment of this race marks the first academic study to
   marshal large-N survey data for the purpose of gauging voter preferences
   in a dueling incumbent primary. This approach gives us a clearer
   understanding of what accounts for the outcome of a highly contentious
   and extremely close election. Our findings suggest the incumbency
   advantage was overridden by voter alignment with the MAGA wing of the
   Republican Party, which produced a narrow victory for the more
   MAGA/Trump-positioned candidate in this race.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Building on the call to further integrate emotions in critical security
   and terrorism studies, we explore the ways emotions figure in media
   discourses and shape responses and policies on the returnee question.
   Through critical discourse analysis and thick description, we show how
   Belgian (potential) returnee men were subject to varying securitising
   discourses and emotional portrayals in media coverage over the past
   decade. Our argument contends that media discourse(s) on the returnee
   question exhibit a complex emotional landscape. We discern dominant,
   alternative and rising emotions that undergird the media coverage. We
   will illustrate how the ``dominant{''} emotion of fear oscillated with
   an ``alternative{''} emotion of vulnerability and, over the course of a
   decade, was accompanied by a ``rising{''} emotion of vindictiveness. We
   argue that the cultivation of vindictiveness contributes to securitising
   narratives that portray Belgian (potential) returnee men as irredeemable
   monsters deserving of extreme punishments. This rising discourse
   undermines democratic principles and the rule of law. We speak of
   political emotions because emotions are deeply intertwined with power
   dynamics, societal structures, and political processes, which shape
   collective attitudes, behaviours, and policies towards (potential)
   returnees.},

Title = {The Bureaucratic Origins of Political Theory: Administrative Labor in
   the ``Other Half{''} of the History of Political Thought},

Abstract = {The earliest works of political theory precede Athenian democracy-the
   traditional starting point of Anglophone histories of political
   thought-by over two millennia. More time passed between the first
   written accounts of government in Mesopotamia and the birth of Plato
   than has passed between Plato's life and ours. And yet this ``other
   half{''} of the history of political thought has barely registered in
   the academic field of political theory. This article seeks to
   ``reset{''} the starting point of the field back to its earliest origins
   in ancient Sumer. Beginning then and there opens a new vista on the
   history of political thought by restoring questions of public
   administration to the foreground of the field. For while the ancient
   Athenians enslaved their bureaucrats and wrote almost nothing about
   them, the analogous actors were free and highly valued in ancient
   Mesopotamian political culture. It was these scribal administrators who
   invented the world's first literature and written political thought. In
   their writings, they valorized their own administrative labor and the
   public goods that it alone could produce as objects of wonder and
   enchantment. From this vantage point, the article calls for a new
   research agenda that will expand political theory's recent
   ``rediscovery{''} of bureaucracy by recovering public administration as
   a major thematic throughline in the five-thousand-year global history of
   human political ideas. Understanding public administration as an
   integral part of large-scale human societies from the very beginning may
   help to counter oligarchic claims in contemporary democracies that
   bureaucracy is a recent alien imposition.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},

Abstract = {The party organization literature has long acknowledged that changes in
   a party's internal power structure bring about changes in leadership
   personnel. However, empirical assessments of how such personnel changes
   relate to party behavior are rare. We explore personnel renewal in the
   party executive as a driver of party policy change and argue that
   focusing on these processes provides for an encompassing perspective on
   the connection between intra-party power and party behavior. Building on
   the party change literature, we theorize on personnel renewal in the
   party executive as a potential stand-alone driver of party policy change
   as well as on its interplay with other explanatory factors and test
   empirical implications based on all major Austrian parties (1949-2019).
   Findings suggest that personnel renewal in the party executive has a
   profound effect on party policy and that these personnel changes are in
   part driven by party performance.},

Abstract = {The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of 2016
   is widely recognised as the benchmark global standard for data-privacy
   law. In recent years, countries across Southeast Asia have enacted or
   updated data-privacy laws with provisions that align with the GDPR. This
   paper explores the balance of internal and external forces driving these
   regulatory changes. It argues that a nuanced understanding of diffusion
   in the policymaking process allows us to see beyond the `Brussels
   Effect' and how the increasing digitalistion of Southeast Asian
   societies has created increasing local demand for regulatory change.
   While an analytical focus on scripting in the drafting of GDPR-like laws
   focuses attention on the extraterritorial reach of the EU's regulatory
   power, an analytical focus on problematisation points to different
   pathways of domestic learning regarding data privacy, especially in
   response to rising data-security threats.},

Abstract = {To explain cross-national variation in the regulation of atypical forms
   of employment, including measures aimed at protecting the employment
   conditions of nonstandard workers, existing studies have typically
   emphasised the importance of labour's relative power resources and
   insider-outsider dynamics. This article shows that differences in
   employer stances can also be of key importance in explaining this type
   of variation. Moreover, it shows that employer support for regulatory
   efforts to improve quality of atypical employment neither have to result
   from a perceived need to seek strategic accommodation nor from a
   positive assessment of the costs and benefits of regulation. It does so
   by comparing the very different responses of Dutch and German employer
   groups to regulatory attempts to improve the quality of part-time
   employment. It illustrates their importance and attributes them to
   strategic choices that were a logical outcome of the different
   institutional environments in which Dutch and German employer groups
   operated.},

   who seek nonacademic careers. This article considers the state of

   across various dimensions and supplement this analysis with survey data
   to gain additional information about the purpose of terminal MA degree
   programs. The results suggest that their reconceptualization is needed

Title = {Public Goods, Expressive Values, and Protest Participation: Evidence
   From a Conjoint Experiment in Hong Kong},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {78},
Number = {1},
Pages = {230-246},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In recent decades, there has been a revival of contentious social
   movements worldwide. Given the collective action problem, what factors
   motivate ordinary citizens to join protests? If the issue of a protest
   matters, what factors motivate people to weigh different issues
   differently? This paper devises a unified theory of collective action
   and argues that individuals are more likely to join a protest when they
   perceive higher values of the public good, higher expressive benefits,
   higher expected turnouts, and lower costs of participation. It contends
   that the effects of those factors are moderated by individuals'
   post-materialist values and confidence in future personal freedom.
   Employing an online conjoint survey experiment to analyze protest
   participation among citizens in Hong Kong, this paper finds that
   protesters are more driven by liberal-democratic issues than
   socioeconomic issues. The findings highlight the mechanisms through
   which political beliefs increase protest participation. Political
   beliefs change the effects of public goods associated with certain
   issues, and to some extent alter the cost-benefit calculations of
   potential protesters.},

Abstract = {Nepal introduced federalism in 2015 with three levels of government:
   federal, provincial, and local. The preamble of the constitution
   mentions that the country's new federal system of government shall
   address three key perennial political and policy problems: (i)
   centralized governance structure, (ii) geographically disbalancing
   developmental approach, and (iii) social injustice leveraged by
   caste-based social structures and unequal economic opportunities. This
   research is an attempt to understand the first 5-year tenure of
   provincial governments (2017-2022) regarding their efforts to attain the
   aforesaid constitutional aims. Findings indicate that provincial
   governments operated in ambiguity during their first electoral tenure,
   resulting in no tangible outcomes. Instead, they generated rather
   pessimistic public impressions about provincial government structure in
   Nepal. The research contributes to broadening the insights on
   intermediary government mechanisms across federal countries, with
   empirical evidence from Nepal.},

Abstract = {The existing literature on Internet governance offers important insights
   on the relationship between state and society in China and the West. It
   is important to explore this relationship in the developing world. This
   study focuses on Pakistan, exploring the role of relevant legal
   frameworks, political authorities, and institutional structures in
   relation to monitoring and regulating telephone traffic, legal
   compliance, and consumer interests. By focusing on the interplay between
   political dynamics, international partnerships, and evolving digital
   landscapes, this study examines the evolution of Internet governance
   model in Pakistan. While Pakistan appears on a trajectory to digital
   authoritarianism, its journey is hampered by structural limitations,
   resistance from democratic forces, concerns about data protection and
   privacy, pushback from the judiciary, and the emergence of a vigilant
   civil society. Challenges in establishing a coherent authoritarian model
   of Internet governance have resulted in an ad hoc approach. This study
   offers a nuanced understanding of multifaceted factors influencing
   Internet governance in a developing country.},

Title = {To Dog-Whistle or to Bark? Elite Communication Strategies When Invoking
   Conspiracy Theories},

Abstract = {When do politicians dog-whistle conspiracy theories (CTs), and when do
   they explicitly endorse - or `bark' - a CT? Over time, does the use of
   dog-whistles shape the degree to which politicians bark? Drawing from
   the models of mass communication literature, we theorize that
   politicians who leverage CTs to garner political support have incentives
   to tailor their communication to their audience. When politicians speak
   to general audiences, they risk being punished for explicitly endorsing
   CTs. However, for parties that use CTs to rally their base,
   dog-whistling a CT may allow politicians to covertly signal support for
   a CT to party faithful. Conversely, amongst audiences primarily composed
   of party loyalists or CT believers, politicians have strong incentives
   to explicitly endorse CTs. We test our theory with data from Poland,
   where a series of CTs emerged following a 2010 plane crash in Smole \&
   nacute;sk, Russia that killed the Polish president and 95 other top
   officials. We draw on speeches and tweets discussing the crash from 2011
   to 2022 by the Law and Justice (PiS) party, which sometimes endorses
   these CTs. We find descriptive evidence that PiS politicians both
   dog-whistle and `bark'. While they tend to dog-whistle more when the
   audience is more diverse, they tend to bark when the audience is more
   uniformly CT-supporting. We find some evidence that politicians bark
   more and dog-whistle less over time, which suggests that, with sustained
   use, dog-whistling may become understood by a wider array of audiences.},

Abstract = {Research on legislative control dynamics has extensively examined how
   political parties use legislative tools to control portfolios and their
   respective heads in coalition governments. However, research has focused
   on partisan-run portfolios and has overlooked how control dynamics are
   affected when portfolio heads are independent, thus not affiliated with
   any party. This article addresses this gap by analysing parliamentary
   questions from 28 German city councils to determine how independent
   portfolios are controlled relative to partisan portfolios. The results
   show that all parties control independent portfolios more intensely than
   partisan portfolios. This is the case for both governing parties and
   opposition parties. However, while government parties control
   independent portfolios more than partisan portfolios, they still do so
   to a lesser extent than opposition parties.},

Abstract = {Since both parties committed to adding women to the federal bench in the
   1970s, Democratic and Republican presidents have sought out qualified
   women for judgeships. Diversifying the bench offers symbolic and
   substantive benefits to both parties, but those benefits come at the
   cost of finding non-traditional nominees. Presidents can take one of two
   different approaches to diversification: maintain existing diversity by
   anchoring women to a seat, or increase diversity by considering women
   for every opening. Given presidents consider many factors, including
   electoral benefits, when selecting potential judges, we expect partisan
   politics influence approach. Examining all lower court nominations made
   between 1981 and 2022, we find that Republican presidents tend to anchor
   while Democratic presidents expand diversity. Additionally, Senate
   diversity influences diversification, as women are more likely to get
   nominated when the relevant state Senate delegation includes a woman.
   Overall, we offer new perspectives on the mechanisms of judicial
   diversification.},

Abstract = {A primary challenge for the administration of public safety is the
   implementation of policy that facilitates effective policing and
   satisfies political pressure over outcomes. I develop a model of police
   administration that captures the tension between policing outcomes and
   policing tactics. The model evaluates how police officers' incentives to
   violate policy limits on their behavior complicate delegation by
   leaders. Police leaders are motivated to provide discretion so officers
   may use appropriate tactics for whatever situation they face but also
   motivated to ensure that police do not abuse discretion and comply with
   limits on their behavior. I use the model to study the effects of
   political control of policing policy and insulation of police officers
   from accountability.},

Abstract = {Do perceptions of migrants' politics affect their reception? The overlap
   between ethnicity and partisanship often makes it difficult to
   disentangle the role of political identity. We leverage a case in which
   migrants come from a similar language and religious background to
   isolate the role of political perceptions. We draw on a unique survey of
   1,000 Colombian citizens and 1,600 Venezuelan migrants in Colombia to
   establish the extent of political misperceptions and their effects on
   migrant reception. Colombians view Venezuelan migrants as left-wing even
   though actual Venezuelan migrants are more right-wing than their
   Colombian hosts. In a conjoint experiment, we find that Colombians
   oppose the settlement of left-wing migrants in their communities, and
   political views matter more than race, skill, or humanitarian need.
   These findings point to overlooked political tensions around migration,
   which may intensify as migrants gain voting rights and politicians
   reinforce migrant stereotypes for electoral gain.},

Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Number = {41},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper explores the relationship between deepfake and fake news
   through the lens of the law. It is divided into three main conceptual
   parts; first, it looks into the conceptual basis, then it explores the
   relationship between disinformation and deepfake, and finally, it offers
   an overview of the relevant regulation in the context of deepfake fake
   news content (in particular, the US, the European and the Chinese
   regulatory trends). The paper pays particular attention to the legal
   perception of disinformation in the context of deepfake technology,
   highlighting the harmful social and legal outcomes involved. It is based
   on an overview of national and international regulations and of the
   relevant literature and includes the authors' proposed solutions to the
   controversies generated by deepfake disinformation.},

Abstract = {A growing body of literature suggests that many citizens reject
   representative politics and demand instead that people or unelected
   experts direct governmental decision-making. This study contributes to
   this literature by highlighting how undetected response biases and other
   sources of measurement error have misled previous inquiries about
   patterns of support for political processes. Using recent cross-national
   surveys with innovative measurement proposals, the article finds that
   theorized dimensions of the political process represent citizens' views
   consistently across citizen backgrounds only when measurement errors are
   corrected. This technical adjustment has substantive theoretical and
   empirical implications for further explanatory analyses. First, it shows
   when indicators measuring the political process are comparable across
   citizens' groups, sharing understandings about and abilities to identify
   the dimensions of the political process with low response bias. Second,
   it finds that uncontrolled measurement errors obscure analyses of who
   supports political processes. Several patterns in explaining citizens'
   preferences turn statistically non-significant, and new predictors
   emerge -mostly associated with citizens' conservatism and resource
   mobilization theory. The findings offer new insights and methodological
   suggestions for future comparative research on citizens' preferences for
   who should govern and how.},

Abstract = {Stance detection is identifying expressed beliefs in a document. While
   researchers widely use sentiment analysis for this, recent research
   demonstrates that sentiment and stance are distinct. This paper advances
   text analysis methods by precisely defining stance detection and
   outlining three approaches: supervised classification, natural language
   inference, and in-context learning. I discuss how document context and
   trade-offs between resources and workload should inform your methods.
   For all three approaches I provide guidance on application and
   validation techniques, as well as coding tutorials for implementation.
   Finally, I demonstrate how newer classification approaches can replicate
   supervised classifiers.},

   Central Asia on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the Romanov
   dynasty. In the work, the method of comparative analysis and
   civilizational approach was used, which made it possible to assess the
   impact of propaganda narratives on the development of the region. The
   study found that the jubilee celebrations were an occasion for the
   build-up of monarchist propaganda. The practical significance of this
   research lies in its detailed analysis of the mechanisms of monarchist
   propaganda during the 300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty in

Abstract = {The best empirical research in political science clearly defines
   substantive parameters of interest, presents a set of assumptions that
   guarantees their identification, and uses an appropriate estimator. We
   argue for the importance of explicitly integrating rigorous theory into
   this process and focus on the advantages of doing so. By integrating a
   theoretical structure into one's empirical strategy, researchers can
   quantify the effects of competing mechanisms, consider the ex-ante
   effects of new policies, extrapolate findings to new environments,
   estimate model-specific theoretical parameters, evaluate the fit of a
   theoretical model, and test competing models that aim to explain the
   same phenomena. As a guide to such a methodology, we provide an overview
   of structural estimation, including formal definitions, implementation
   suggestions, examples, and comparisons to other methods.},

Abstract = {We consider the classic veto bargaining model but allow the agenda
   setter to engage in persuasion to convince the veto player to approve
   her proposal. We show that the proposer-optimal can be achieved either
   by providing no information or with a simple binary experiment. Proposer
   chooses to reveal partial information when there is sufficient expected
   misalignment with Vetoer. In this case, the opportunity to engage in
   persuasion strictly benefits Proposer and increases the scope to
   exercise agenda power. We discuss applications and how the optimal
   experiment can be implemented in practice.},

Abstract = {In recent years, research on gun ownership has grown substantially but
   there has been less exploration of variation within gun owners. This
   study examines the differences in support for democracy between gun
   owners and non-gun owners, and in doing so makes an important
   contribution to the political science literature on group behavior and
   attitudes. We utilize OLS regression to analyze data from the 2020
   American National Election Studies and 2016 General Social Survey public
   opinion surveys and find that there is a stark divide among gun owners
   on support for measures of democratic norms. Gun owners are more
   supportive than non-owners on some measures, but on others there was no
   relationship between owning a firearm and democratic attitudes. We
   suggest this is because partisanship-specifically support for Donald
   Trump-pulled gun owners' attitudes in opposite directions. These results
   are consistent with previous work on cross-pressured voters and
   highlight the limits of group influence in a world where citizens have
   multiple identities. We conclude that gun owners don't appear
   meaningfully different from non-owners on measures of democratic
   support.},

Abstract = {The article consists of three parts. The first contains a theoretical
   analysis of the phenomenon of US political polarization and discusses
   the main approaches to its explanation, primarily through the prism of
   the influence of political elites. The authors note a logical
   contradiction in the existing concepts, which postulate the existence of
   an ``asymmetry{''} in the influence of elites on polarization in the
   United States, arguing that the contribution of the Republicans is more
   destructive than the contribution of representatives of the Democratic
   Party. The authors find the growth of political polarization, regardless
   of party preferences (while noting the importance of elite behavior as
   one of the central factors of political polarization). The second part
   examines the phenomenon of affective (or emotional polarization), based
   on the socio-psychological rejection of representatives of an alien
   political camp. Based on the results of a network analysis of a
   two-modal network consisting of pre-election messages and topics
   selected by the authors themselves, the author notes that all
   candidates, without exception, are prone to emotional affect as part of
   their election campaign. The third part is devoted to the study of
   positional (or ideological) polarization, in which the author, on the
   basis of Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis, divides the corpus of
   campaign messages of candidates into separate topics and, through a
   comparative analysis, finds a significant distance from ``bipartisan{''}
   topics (i.e. from the political center) among all candidates.},

Abstract = {Over a decade ago Ishiyama, Miles, and Balarezo (2010) published their
   work on the pedagogical training opportunities for political science
   doctoral students in the United States. The authors surveyed
   PhD-granting political science departments and found that pedagogical
   training for doctoral students was scant. Despite its age, the work
   remains influential and cited by scholars concerned with the state of
   teaching-training in the discipline. In this paper I uncover that little
   progress has been made in training opportunities for political science
   graduate students. Interviews with faculty in 66 PhD-granting
   departments reveal that less than a fifth of departments require
   students to complete credit-bearing courses and a plurality require no
   pedagogical training. Several departments have outsourced pedagogical
   training and do not maintain data on student completion. As such, many
   graduate students remain inadequately prepared for careers in higher
   education. I conclude by echoing colleagues who call for increased
   attention on pedagogical training, and for a benefit structure rewarding
   high quality teaching.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to advance the literature by improving the
   measurement of populism in content analyses. Following the
   conceptualization of the ideational approach, we argue that populist key
   elements (such uch as people-centrism and anti-elitism) need to co-occur
   for a political actor to be considered a populist. Strikingly enough,
   this conditional requirement only plays a marginal role in empirical
   analyses thus far. When it comes to the aggregation of populist key
   elements into a composite measure scholar tend to rely on summary
   indices. To better differentiate between populists and non-populists, we
   propose the use of an alternative aggregation procedure, the conditional
   summary index (CSI). ). Based on a quantitative content analysis of
   campaign speeches given by 22 candidates in South American presidential
   elections (2012-2018), 012-2 018), we show that, contrary to the summary
   index, the CSI only yields positive scores for those politicians that
   the literature commonly identifies as being populist (i.e., Hugo Chavez,
   Rafael Correa, Evo Morales and Jair Bolsonaro).},

Abstract = {The archive of Noah Webster's work shows that, contrary to the scholarly
   consensus, Emile, Jean-Jacques Rousseau's landmark treatise on
   education, had a marked influence on Webster and, through Webster, on
   the foundations of American education. After reading Emile, Webster used
   certain of Rousseau's ideas to formulate a nation-building argument for
   female education. Additionally, Webster inherited the views that
   children are sinners (Puritan) or empty vessels (Locke). After reading
   Rousseau, Webster added a third view: that children have passions and
   appetites that should be cultivated and shaped but not destroyed. These
   ideas, derived at least in part from Rousseau, represent a theoretically
   important impact of Rousseau's ideas on Webster and, through him, on the
   mainstream of American education.},

Abstract = {This article addresses certain interpretations of Brazilian protests
   known as the June Journeys of 2013. The qualitative research found 134
   Brazilian academic publications, among scientific articles, theses and
   dissertations. Based on this material we devoloped a critical
   systematization of the literature on the Journeys in which we discern
   the arguments present in the texts on the origins, characteristics and
   legacies of the Journeys, problematizing some of these interpretations.
   We argue that June 2013 was a cycle of protests that involved a variety
   of actors, agendas and repertoires producing diverse legacies. In this
   way, we provide the reader with an understanding of the Journeys,
   pointing to the disputes and complexities of the phenomenon, thus
   avoiding certain generalizations about it.},

Abstract = {Are Iceland's interests represented on the UN Security Council, even
   when Iceland is not a member? This paper explores two questions: whether
   the Nordics share cohesive foreign policy preferences, and whether these
   shared preferences translate into substantive representation on the UN
   Security Council. Using ideal points derived from UN General Assembly
   voting patterns, the study systematically compares the alignment of
   Nordic preferences with Iceland's. The analysis finds that while Nordic
   countries consistently align in their foreign policy preferences, their
   ability to advance shared goals during Security Council membership is
   limited. These findings suggest that substantive representation is
   constrained, but that does not preclude the possibility that Iceland may
   still benefit from the symbolic and descriptive representation afforded
   by Nordic involvement. The study contributes to broader debates on
   small-state collaboration and the complexities of achieving tangible
   policy outcomes within multilateral institutions.},

Abstract = {Today most critical theorists who deploy history use a genealogical
   method forged by Nietzsche and Foucault. This genealogical approach now
   dominates historically inflected critique. But not all genealogical
   writings today, nor all philosophical debates surrounding genealogy,
   advance the goals of critical philosophy. It is crucial now that we
   assess the value of genealogical critiques. The proper metric against
   which to evaluate such work is whether it contributes to transforming
   ourselves, others, and society in a valuable way. In this article, I
   propose that we use the term ``critical genealogy{''} to identify those
   genealogical practices that positively nourish our activity and,
   thereby, advance the ambition of critical philosophy.},

Abstract = {Congressional redistricting requires institutions to make decisions
   about which criteria they will use to draw new district boundaries.
   These decisions unavoidably prioritize certain criteria at the expense
   of other criteria. Further, the competitive nature of redistricting
   criteria also means that when institutions use certain criteria at the
   expense of others, they are also correlating with certain forms of group
   representation at the expense of others. This paper argues that the
   representational consequences of redistricting are best understood
   through an approach that accounts for this process and the full array of
   redistricting institutions and criteria. Using a novel research design
   and an extensive data set covering six decades of redistricting cycles,
   this paper supports these claims with empirical evidence describing the
   relationships of seven categories of redistricting institutions with a
   wide range of criteria. This paper finds that partisan legislatures,
   bipartisan legislatures, and political commissions facilitate partisan
   group representation; state courts facilitate geographic group
   representation; federal courts facilitate racial and ethnic group
   representation; and independent commissions facilitate both geographic
   and racial/ethnic group representation. These findings emphasize that
   Americans are categorized and grouped differently during congressional
   redistricting depending on who is drawing the lines.},

Abstract = {Recent research emphasizes social media's potential for citizens to
   express shared grievances. In active conflict, however, social media
   posts indicating political loyalties can pose severe risks to civilians.
   We develop a theory that explains how civilians modify their online
   behavior as part of efforts to improve their security during conflict.
   After major changes in territorial control, civilians should be more
   likely to post positive content, and more content that supports the
   winning side. We study social media behavior during and after the siege
   of Aleppo in November 2016. We match Aleppo-based Twitter users with
   users from other parts of Syria and use large language models to analyze
   changes in online behavior after the regime's retaking of the city.
   Results show that users in Aleppo post more positive and pro-Assad
   content, but only when self-disclosing their location. The findings have
   important implications for our understanding of digital communication in
   civil conflict.},

Abstract = {Social alienation necessitates a critique against social paradoxes that
   disregard individual experiences and portray societal failures as
   successes. Aaron Curme adopts the extremes of invisibility and silence
   to counteract these paradoxes and constructs an artistic identity of
   resistance, a demonstrative choice of resistance, an extreme, ironic and
   paradoxical behavior aiming to directly expose the core of problems.
   Employing auto-hermeneutics, the artist's self-conscious artistic
   practices are observed that embody paradoxical empowerment through
   absence, and constantly transform the silence into a subtly
   communicative and aesthetically appreciative form that offers a novel
   interpretation towards the unheard perspectives of others.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {16},

Pages = {596-611},

Abstract = {Spatial inequalities within countries have recently been seen as a
   source of resentment, suggesting a ``geography of discontent{''} in
   Europe. We examine this hypothesis by analyzing satisfaction with
   democracy (SWD) in urban and rural areas over the last two decades.
   Based on data from the European Social Survey (2002-2020) covering 19
   countries and corroborated by the International Social Survey Programme
   and the European Values Survey, we find that urban-rural differences in
   SWD are statistically significant but very small over the whole period
   studied - only about 2.5 percentage points between big cities and rural
   areas. This gap is minimal compared to differences between countries and
   between socioeconomic groups such as citizenship, employment status,
   education, social class, or income. These results hold across various
   political satisfaction measures, such as trust in parliament or
   politicians. Despite significant cross-country heterogeneity in spatial
   disparities, they challenge the notion of widespread rural discontent in
   Europe.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, fiscal integration in Europe has manifested through
   restrictive rules. However, the consolidation of public finances often
   encounters citizens' resistance. International obligations can raise
   public support for costly domestic policies that are consistent with the
   obligations' terms, but can European fiscal pledges influence public
   opinion and boost support for austerity? I fielded an original survey
   experiment in Italy and manipulated information about the existence of a
   new fiscal rule, national or European, mandating austerity measures. In
   stark contrast with extant research, I find no evidence that the source
   of the fiscal rule matters when measuring respondents' support for
   austerity. This result suggests that the effect of international pledges
   on garnering public support for costly domestic measures wanes if these
   measures directly burden citizens' financial well-being. Moreover,
   relinquishing fiscal autonomy in favour of new European rules appears
   unlikely to aid politicians in winning public endorsement for an
   austerity agenda.},

Abstract = {This study critically assesses security dynamics in developing nations,
   centering on water scarcity in Iraq. It challenges the reductionist
   perspective that equates security solely with the absence of military
   threats, positing instead that the governing body itself can constitute
   an existential threat to the state. Many developing countries, typified
   by a myopic conception of security, have engendered internal insecurity.
   Iraq exemplifies this paradigm, where successive ruling elites, marked
   by military adventurism and administrative incompetence, directly
   precipitate water scarcity. The nation's ominous trajectory results from
   governmental prioritization of external threats over essential societal
   well-being. This article elucidates the intricate interplay between
   governance priorities and societal vulnerabilities, advocating for a
   more comprehensive understanding of security that transcends
   conventional militaristic frameworks. The analysis underscores the
   urgent need for recalibrating security paradigms in developing countries
   to address internal threats emanating from governmental neglect and
   skewed priorities.},

Abstract = {Political science, as a discipline, encompasses the systematic study of
   the state and its associated institutions through empirical and
   normative methods. However, the scope of political science has expanded
   to include research on various socioeconomic, cultural, and
   psychological factors that affect the functioning and governance of the
   state. Despite the global attention to political science research, there
   is a scarcity of studies specifically focused on political science
   literature in Asia. Therefore, this research article aims to fill this
   gap by conducting a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of political
   science publications in Asia. Utilizing Bibliometric Analysis data
   extracted from the Scopus database spanning the period from 1991 to
   2023, various bibliometric indicators were employed to examine the
   political science literature. The indicators included measures such as
   annual growth of publications, international collaborations, impact
   factor, highly cited articles, active countries, institutions, journals,
   and authors. The findings shed light on the growth trajectory of
   political science publications, the extent of international
   collaborations, the influence of highly cited articles, and the key
   countries, institutions, journals, and authors contributing to the
   field. This study is a significant contribution to the field, as it
   addresses the gap in literature reviews specifically focused on
   political science in Asia.},

Abstract = {Rousseau is well-known for his work on education, entitled Emile, or On
   Education, and equally vilified for the gendered education presented in
   its concluding chapter. This is not his only educational offering,
   however. He proposes an alternative moral education in his preceding
   novel, Julie, or the New Heloise, and this education avoids the problems
   inherent in Emile's and Sophie's educations, as well as offering us
   contemporary readers something more palatable. In Emile, the characters
   receive gendered educations that make them dependent moral halves,
   necessitated by the ``second birth{''} of humans as sexual beings,
   whereas in Julie, the characters receive an education that cultivates
   both masculine and feminine judgment in each to make them independent
   moral agents, constituting a possible ``third birth{''} for humans.
   While this education is perhaps only suitable in certain contexts, it
   reveals a complexity to Rousseau's thought on women and education that
   has not been previously acknowledged.},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue that gendered abuse is only defined as such
   within certain institutional configurations and norms (and the language
   in which the norms are expressed). Consequently, the absence or
   deficiency of a particular structure for identifying or naming abuse is
   itself a kind of abuse, both deeply personal in its effects, but
   institutional in its nature. I call this phenomenon ``discursive
   cornering.{''} To build this argument, I draw from work on the concept
   of consent by two feminist political thinkers: nonfiction writer Melissa
   Febos and television creator Michaela Coel. I examine Febos' essay
   ``Thank You for Taking Care of Yourself{''} on the politics of what she
   terms ``empty consent,{''} a descriptor she uses to detail how
   patriarchal structures can pressure women into reluctantly agreeing to
   their own oppression. I analyze Coel's critically acclaimed HBO series
   ``I May Destroy You{''} to show that what constitutes rape, sexual
   assault, and abuse is always defined within particular legal structures,
   which are themselves embedded in diverse political climates. I show that
   understandings of abuse must acknowledge the structures that define
   abuse, and we must remember that those structures can also themselves be
   abusive. Otherwise, we are unable to understand how survivors' agency
   works without implicitly minimizing harm.},

Title = {Thin or thick? Populist and radical right politics across European
   cities, suburbs, and countryside},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 8},
Abstract = {The surge of populist and radical right phenomena reshaped European
   political geography. Yet the connections between places of residence and
   populist or radical right politics tended to be neglected until
   recently. This paper addresses the gap by exploring how residency
   relates to support for populism and the radical right in contemporary
   Europe. Focusing on the distinction between `cities', `towns-suburbs',
   and `countryside', I conduct an individual-level investigation of
   populist and radical right votes and attitudes across different
   residential contexts. The analysis is based on European Social Survey
   data (2020-22) from 23 countries, in both Western (WE) and
   Central-Eastern (CEE) Europe. The key finding is that the cleavage
   between cities and suburban-rural areas is much more related to the
   thick ideological underpinnings of the radical right-authoritarianism
   and nativism-than the thin, purely populist, dimension. Nativism
   particularly is stronger the more rural the place of residence,
   irrespective of the individual's socio-economic profile, political
   orientations, the extent to which their region is left-behind, and
   whether they live in WE or CEE. Hence, future research on the
   geographical polarization of politics may turn its attention to the
   radical right, more than to populism per se.},

Abstract = {The article analyses how the Russian official representation of the war
   in Ukraine has been sacralised and then applied to the identity-building
   strategy. Sacralisation is considered a way to legitimise politics by
   attributing transcendental meaning and significance to it. This paper
   suggests a framework for identifying the use of sacralisation techniques
   and discusses the potential applications of the sacralised war narrative
   lying beyond the justification of war. It is shown that the Russian
   representation of the war, once sacralised, has codified the ideological
   leitmotifs of the last decades. It has built a holistic and
   comprehensive cognitive schema grounded in pre-constructed identity
   beliefs and ideas. The state of war allowed the establishment of this
   framework in a top-down way. Thus, the article claims that discursive
   sacralisation not only justifies warfare but can also intensify identity
   politics.},

Abstract = {This research aims to find out the implementation of a mental revolution
   that encourages the acceleration of innovation and digitalization of
   public services through the implementation of egovernment to build a
   clean, effective, democratic and trusted government. The research design
   uses descriptive qualitative research by analyzing policy documents.
   This article examines the evolution of public service innovation
   policies in Indonesia related to the mental revolution initiative. The
   documents reviewed are laws, government regulations, ministerial
   regulations, and policy documents related to public service innovation
   and transformation, as well as egovernment from January 2014 to May
   2024. The results showed that since the launch of the National Movement
   for Mental Revolution, through the Indonesia Serves program, there has
   been an acceleration of the process of developing public service
   digitization innovations. This initiative encourages the acceleration of
   changes in the quality of public services by accelerating changes in the
   mindset, attitudes, and behavior of state civil apparatus to produce
   service innovations that improve the quality of public services. The
   acceleration of innovation development through egovernment and public
   service digitalization can be realized with budget support, human
   resource readiness, sustainable policy commitment, and strong leadership
   in supporting the sustainability of holistic public service innovation.},

Title = {The narcissistic celebrity leader: Berlusconi's communication style and
   its impact on Italian leadership},

Abstract = {Among the many facets of Silvio Berlusconi's extensive political career,
   his communication strategies and techniques stand out as particularly
   significant. This prominence is largely due to his dual role as a media
   tycoon and a flamboyant, narcissistic figure, both of which heavily
   influenced his public communication style. This article delves into
   Berlusconi's communication approach as a critical element of his
   leadership. It examines how Berlusconi shaped his leadership image over
   the decades, focusing on his personality, storytelling, and the media
   and political marketing tools he employed to project his persona.
   Furthermore, in its concluding part, it investigates whether recent
   Italian leaders, particularly those who emerged in the 2010s after
   Berlusconi's tenure, exhibit traits traceable to Berlusconi's
   innovations. The article's initial sections explore Berlusconi's
   personality profile, his narrative techniques, and the media and
   political marketing strategies he used. The penultimate section
   highlights the interplay of these elements, showing how they created a
   distinctive, innovative leadership style linked to various facets of
   celebrity politics, sometimes in extreme forms. This section also
   addresses the legacy of Berlusconi's leadership style, proposing that it
   served as a model for later Italian leaders, influencing their
   communication and image-building strategies. The article concludes by
   noting how, as a consequence, Berlusconi's leadership model has been a
   transformative factor in Italian politics.},

Abstract = {Pre-election policy statements are important because they reveal
   information about parties' policies and intended post-election
   priorities. Content analysis data from election manifestos, webpages,
   television broadcasts, and leaders' speeches reveal clear left-right
   differences between the dominant Labour and National parties at
   elections between 1984 and 2023, with the exception of 1990. Between
   1993 and 1999 and since 2011 broadcasts and speeches by National have
   been more right-wing on a left-right summary dimension than National's
   manifestos and detailed webpages. The reverse was usually true for the
   right-wing Act Party, while New Zealand First's position varied more in
   broadcasts and speeches than in its print programme. No real pattern for
   left-right topics was evident for the other parties. However, references
   to the environment, indigenous rights, and foreign policy were higher in
   long print documents than in television broadcasts and speeches. In
   contrast, political authority references were relatively low in print
   documents. When using equivalent documents, the Green and M \& amacr;ori
   parties, followed by Labour, were usually most supportive of
   environmental protection and socially progressive policies. The results
   confirm the importance of using similar documents, insofar as is
   possible, when making comparisons. In addition, shorter documents may be
   more useful for understanding parties' main priorities.},

Abstract = {Many are skeptical of the appeal of authoritarian political systems. We
   argue that global audiences will embrace authoritarian models when they
   believe that autocracies can meet governance challenges better than
   democracies. We collect comprehensive data on the external messaging of
   the Chinese and American governments. We then conduct a randomized
   experiment in 19 countries across six continents exposing global
   citizens to real messages from the Chinese and American governments'
   external media arms. We find that exposure to a representative set of
   Chinese messages strengthens perceptions that the Chinese Communist
   Party delivers growth, stability, and competent leadership. It also
   moves the average respondent from slightly preferring the American model
   to slightly preferring the Chinese model. In head-to-head matchups,
   messages from the US government are less persuasive. Our findings show
   how autocracies build global support by selling growth and competence,
   with important implications for democratic resilience.},

Abstract = {It has been reported that shoplifting has reached `epidemic' levels.
   Comparing police record crime data with industry estimates reveals that
   potentially just 2.4 per cent of thefts are reported to and recorded by
   the police. This is creating a large intelligence gap that emboldens
   thieves, enables organised criminal networks to go undetected, and makes
   it difficult for the police to prioritise retail crime and detect the
   most prolific and serious offenders. This article outlines some of the
   political issues with recording high-volume crime and the resource
   implications of increased reporting. The article presents the case for
   the development of a national retail crime intelligence bureau to
   improve reporting and close the intelligence gap on shoplifting.},

Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Many countries have embarked on decentralization as a way to mitigate
   separation tendencies. Even though decentralization could satisfy some
   separation tendencies, the central government might be unable or
   unwilling to award the localities the level of decentralization they
   require to stay in the union. This mismatch may give rise to domestic
   violence and internal conflict. We propose a simple two-stage model that
   combines the decentralization and domestic terrorism literature in a
   single structural model, which can be readily tested using existing data
   in the disciplines. As long as the actual decentralization level meets
   the unobserved desired value by the localities, there will be a high
   likelihood of observing a zero incidence of domestic terrorism.
   Otherwise, the incidents happen regularly with mitigating effects from
   decentralization. Our model also accounts for the left-censoring of the
   terrorism data at zero. We examine our model using 5-year interval panel
   data of more than 60 countries based on the information for 1970-2019.
   Our results indicate a strong negative and statistically significant
   relationship between fiscal decentralization and domestic terrorism
   events. One percent increase in fiscal decentralization is associated
   with a two to three percent decline in domestic terrorism incidents. The
   coefficients of the selection model and domestic terrorism model
   generally conform to the literature.},

Abstract = {On 10 March 2024 the Commission on the Centre of Government published
   its final report: Power with Purpose. The aim of the commission had been
   to explore why Number Ten, the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury do not
   always work as well as they should and to explore what could be done to
   improve the centre of government radically. Perennial concerns about the
   existence of a `hollow crown' at the centre of British government were,
   the final report recommended, to be resolved through the implementation
   of a `radical' reform agenda. This article interrogates the commission's
   proposals from a critical perspective and builds upon existing concerns
   as to the viability of further centralising power in Whitehall. It
   achieves this by reflecting on an understanding of why history,
   criticality, governance, evidence and relationships matter when seeking
   to cope with complexity or when designing genuinely `radical' new
   governance capabilities. It is argued that a full appreciation of these
   factors is essential to any project to strengthen the core executive and
   offers a more balanced, relational and systemic approach to nurturing
   strategic capacity in government.},

Title = {Regulate against the machine: how the EU mitigates AI harm to democracy},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {1067-1090},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Democracies are under attack from various sides. In recent years
   AI-powered techniques such as profiling, targeting, election
   manipulation, and massive disinformation campaigns via social bots and
   troll farms challenge the very foundations of democratic systems.
   Against this background, demands for regulating AI have gotten louder.
   In this paper, we focus on the European Union (EU) as the actor that has
   gone the furthest in terms of regulating AI. We therefore ask: What kind
   of instruments does the EU envision in their binding and non-binding
   documents to prevent AI harm to democracy? And what critique can be
   formulated regarding these instruments? To address these questions, the
   article makes two contributions. First, by building on a systematic
   understanding of deliberative democracy, we introduce the distinction
   between two types of harm that can arise from the widespread use of AI:
   rights-based harm and systemic harm. Second, by analysing a number of EU
   documents, including the GDPR, the AI Act, the TTAP, and the DSA, we
   argue that the EU envisions four primary instruments for safeguarding
   democracy from the harmful use of AI: prohibition, transparency, risk
   management, and digital education. While these instruments provide a
   relatively high level of protection for rights-based AI harm, there is
   still ample space for these technologies to produce systemic harm to
   democracy.},

Abstract = {Does a leader's gender affect a country's performance during a health
   crisis, and through what mechanisms? This study finds a clear,
   substantial negative correlation between having a female leader in
   democracies and their COVID-19 infections and mortality rates, rejecting
   multiple spurious claims. The research is the first to analyse four
   pandemic waves covering 2 years while performing inter-wave analysis.
   The gendered performance gap continuously grew during the first three
   waves, moderated by vaccinations in the fourth wave. We found that trust
   and effectiveness mechanisms impacted the growth of the performance gap.
   As new variants of COVID-19 continue to spread and new threats related
   to the climate crisis are threatening globally, understanding the impact
   of gender in leadership roles, particularly during global crises, can
   provide valuable insights for policy makers and national leaders.},

Abstract = {This essay traces the genealogy of the concept of the postmodern in Jack
   Amariglio's body of work. It recognizes the collaborative accent of
   Amariglio's writing practice and renders visible a field of discourse
   that has materialized through the network of collaborations that
   Amariglio, through the concept of the postmodern, has thereby activated.
   According to Amariglio, the postmodern, as an epistemological rather
   than ontological concept, is a discursive byproduct of modernist
   discourses that emerge endogenously from within the latter but always in
   a relation of heterogeneity toward their native discourses. A key
   characteristic of Amariglio's writing has been to highlight these
   extimate tendencies and trace their consequences on economics as a
   postmodern discourse. In the spirit of his deconstructive drive, this
   essay extends his thinking on the postmodern through a number of
   postmodern moments he has identified, especially in his work with David
   Ruccio, through the psychoanalytical concept of the uncanny.},

Abstract = {Studies on the Irish referendum experience have generally accepted that
   political parties play a fundamental role in the direct democratic
   process. While this is rarely problematised, parties often campaign in
   referendums in order to steer them towards outcomes that are
   strategically beneficial. Contemporary research on Irish referendums has
   delved into how parties shape their campaigns to achieve these goals,
   but a more preliminary question is still to be addressed: to what extent
   do parties participate in referendum campaigns? This paper attempts to
   do so by examining campaign expenditure, which offers a concrete
   quantitative indicator for party engagement vis-\& agrave;-vis
   referendums. Departing from theory on party behaviour and referendum
   instrumentalization, the article takes into account Irish regulations on
   campaign finance before offering a descriptive and explorative
   comparison of the expenditure of Irish political parties in recent
   referendum campaigns. Several patterns within the data are then
   discussed in light of potential influential factors identified in
   previous scholarly work. Results suggest that a referendum's topic and
   its salience in the public sphere, as well as a party's financial
   resources and government status, could explain party behaviour in Irish
   referendum campaigns, and a set of congruent hypotheses for future
   research are formulated in the conclusion.},

Abstract = {The recent Covid-19 pandemic has seen the adoption in many countries of
   emergency legislation. In the case of France, this led to the adoption
   of authoritative measures, including lockdowns and other decisions
   reducing civil liberties. These measures are a result of the strong
   distrust political authorities have in their own administration and
   population. Along with the creation of ad hoc organizations alongside
   traditional bureaucracies, these measures produce vicious circles, in
   which attempts to circumvent resistance or apathy are met with even
   stronger resistance, leading to the adoption of further measures to
   address this issue, and so on. As our societies will be exposed to other
   crisis situations in the future, this could lead to an increase in
   authoritarian styles of government, even in democratic countries.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {86},
Number = {3},
Pages = {983-996},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {International relations research suggests that powerful states can use
   both arms transfers and alliance commitments to improve the security of
   friendly states. This work largely assumes these different strategies
   are either complementary or straightforward substitutes for one another.
   Here, I consider the ways in which arms sales and alignment interact,
   highlighting the conditions under which arms transfers can either
   undermine or enhance the credibility of extended deterrent threats. I
   study a formal model in which a patron can increase a client's defense
   capabilities through arms transfers, which in turn generate audience
   costs if the patron fails to defend that client in a conflict. The model
   yields several important results. Under different conditions arms
   transfers can either entrap a patron in a war it hoped to avoid or allow
   it to escape a war it would otherwise have joined. But most strikingly,
   arms sales can make extended deterrent threats less credible by
   decreasing the patron's marginal contribution to a joint military
   effort. The model shows that under some conditions arms transfers can
   actually cause deterrence failure.},

Journal = {PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {54},
Number = {3},
Pages = {310-331},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A prominent scholarship contends that presidential norms are
   particularly vital to a well-functioning democracy. However, scant
   empirical research exists on the topic. I investigate public attitudes
   toward a novel battery of what many scholars and journalists consider
   presidential norms and examine the extent to which partisan and policy
   concerns affect attitudes toward them. Original survey data show that
   Americans strongly support presidential norms. I argue that there are
   two salient dimensions of presidential norms-what I call structural
   norms and presentation norms. Structural norms promote and support
   constitutional government. Presentation norms concern expectations about
   when and how presidents should present themselves before the public.
   Partisans evaluate the two types of presidential norms differentially,
   with Republicans notably expressing lower support for structural norms.
   I then present experimental evidence that the public's support for
   presidential norms is malleable to partisan framing. These results
   suggest that the public supports presidential norms in the abstract, but
   compelling rhetoric can facilitate presidential norm violations.},

Abstract = {Over the past decades, the level of regulation of fixed-term contracts
   has been in flux. Many reforms deregulating these contracts were
   followed by a regulatory countertrend, a puzzling finding considering
   influential theoretical expectations like the ones developed by the
   dualization and liberalization literatures. This paper draws on the
   comparative employment relations and comparative political economy
   literatures to identify the drivers of pro-outsider reforms.
   Furthermore, it develops an innovative argument claiming that
   governments may rely on support from a `domestic coalition' including
   workers in permanent contracts, or they can leverage the European link
   to support their intention of conducting a pro-outsider reform. Each of
   these paths relies on the assemblage of distinct pro-reform coalitions
   of policy actors. To test our argument, the paper uses fsQCA. We compare
   38 reforms enacted in 16 European countries between 1985-2019. After the
   fsQCA analysis, we conduct a qualitative discussion of the different
   paths.},

Abstract = {This article examines the strategies of Jutice Alexandre de Moraes in
   the Brazilian Supreme Court, focusing on their potential qualification
   as Lawfare in the context of judicial inquiries conducted by the
   Justice. This research analyses the nature and impact of Moraes'
   strategies, assessing potential political motivations, procedural
   irregularities, and the instrumentalization of legal tools to possibly
   target political adversaries. By shedding light on specific
   investigations in the Federal Supreme Court, this research contributes
   to the study of the instrumentalization of law for political purposes
   and the consequences for the rule of law. This study aims to foster
   discussions about the complex interaction between law, politics, and
   justice in democratic societies.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do individuals support armed humanitarian
   intervention (AHI) in situations where mass atrocities are ongoing? This
   article tests several hypotheses about support for AHIs to isolate and
   interact two potential drivers: international law and the probability of
   success. It leverages an original, pre-registered experiment from a
   (quota) representative sample of over 1500 Dutch citizens. Consistent
   with our hypotheses, we find that support for AHI increases when an
   action is authorized by the UN Security Council (UNSC) and has a high
   (80\%) chance of success. But the Dutch remain supportive of AHI in
   situations of mass atrocities even when AHI has a low chance of success
   (20\%). Importantly, we find that the chance of success does not affect
   the support for AHIs as much as the international law does. This
   suggests that in similar situations legal and procedural reasons may
   influence public opinion more than a logic of consequences.},

Title = {Indigenous herbal bricoleur methods for curing nocturnal enuresis among
   the yorubas of southwestern Nigeria},
Journal = {CIMEXUS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {197-207},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {This paper explores the indigenous knowledge of herbal, social, and
   bricoleur methods used to cure nocturnal enuresis (NE) among the Yoruba
   people of Southwestern Nigeria. Two methods were identified, namely, the
   ladder climbing /Oharan (Big Squirrel) method and the indigenous banana
   stem method. However, for scientific and clarity reasons, this paper
   focuses only on the the indigenous banana stem method. The study further
   explores the procedures of how to prepare the herbal medicine through
   the indigenous banana stem method to curing the Persistent Primary
   Nocturnal Enuresis illness (NE), which is mainly caused by either the
   psychological or spiritual influences in the local environment. The
   paper adopted an explanatory research methodology, using percentages
   mainly, to investigate how the NE is cured among the Yoruba cultural
   group in the study area. Multi-staged sampling technique was adopted in
   selecting the sample population. Data were collected from primary and
   secondary sources. Primary data were collected, first, from a sample of
   10 adults (comprising of 6 men and 4 women), out of a population of 15
   adults whose treatments are on going at the period of collection of data
   for this research. The 15 adults were suffering from the NE at the time
   of this survey. The 15 patients came directly to the indigenous healing
   centre at the secluded area of Modakeke town within the Ile-Ife
   cosmopolitan town at the time the data was collected. Using convenience
   sampling technique, 10 patients were marked down as sample for the
   survey because they resided around the Ife environs and could be quickly
   monitored while the remaining 5 patients came from a faraway place
   within Nigeria. Second, also 10 healed ex patients living in ife
   environs, out of a population of 20 ex patients who suffered in the past
   from NE, but who had received perfect healing in the past 5 years were
   followed up using the addresses indicated during their first
   registration at the healing centre. In total, the survey included 20
   respondents from a population of 35. The study adopted explanatory
   research design, using mainly percentages, to allow for deep
   understanding of the research topic. The information needed were also
   collected from secondary sources that have been classified as credible
   published articles. Subsequently, the data generated were analyzed for
   easy apprehension using appropriate descriptive and inferential tool,
   percentages. The findings showed that the indigenous banana stem herbal
   remedy is very effective in permanently curing NE among the
   patients/respondents. This indigenous banana stem herbal remedy was
   found sufficient enough to put an end to respondents bed-wetting. This
   finding provided an important information and made immense contribution
   to the understanding of indigenous knowledge as a potential source for
   new treatments of NE.},

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {During the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Swedish government
   did not implement the hard lockdowns and coercive measures found in many
   countries and instead relied on voluntary social distancing measures and
   work-from-home initiatives. Unlike its international counterparts in
   most countries, the rightwing populist party in Sweden early on took a
   critical approach toward the government's handling of the Covid-19
   pandemic, calling for stricter government measures to curb virus
   transmission. Based on theories about strategic party positioning, and
   theories about political elite cues and framing effects, we use Swedish
   survey data from the early stages of the pandemic to show that the views
   of rightwing populist party supporters aligned with the rhetoric of the
   Swedish rightwing populist party in demanding more (rather than less)
   government intervention to curb the spread of SARS-COV-2. Our results
   suggest that they did so by drawing on core rightwing populist themes of
   anti-elitism and nationalism. Hence, our results speak to the role of
   elite cues and framing in public opinion formation during times of
   crisis, particularly among rightwing populists, who generally opposed
   stricter government measures to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {Democracies require militaries that protect citizen well-being without
   threatening to overthrow the government or otherwise jeopardize public
   safety. The military should therefore be firmly under the command of
   civilian elected leaders, playing a minimal role in the political
   process. Previous research examines whether the public thinks such
   boundaries of civil-military relations should exist, and finds that
   people can see the military as a check to democratically elected
   administrations in the opposing party. Here, we ask a parallel question:
   Does place of residence influence attitudes about the boundaries of
   civil-military relations? We expect rural individuals and those higher
   in rural resentment to similarly see the military as a check to a
   civilian government as previous research suggests that rural residents
   are resentful towards government and centers of power. Using original
   survey data, we find that people high in such rural resentment are
   sometimes more willing to defer to the military. Finally, we
   successfully replicate findings from Krebs et al. (2023) under a
   Democratic administration. These results have implications for
   democratic governance and public support, particularly among facets of
   the public that have lower trust in government.},

Abstract = {Spanish nationalism has been a controversial issue among scholars, to
   the extent that even its existence has been questioned. In this study,
   the characteristics of Spanish nationalist feeling are analyzed. We use
   content analysis of newspapers during the `Catalan challenge,' a period
   of open conflict between the Catalan pro-independence political forces
   and the Spanish State. During the `Catalan challenge', the
   characteristics of Spanish nationalism became more visible, making this
   period an opportunity to carrying out this analysis. The results point
   to a nationalism with unique characteristics, that we have called Hidden
   Nationalism. These findings could have key implications for the analysis
   of political attitudes in Spain.},

Abstract = {This article presents an ethnographic analysis of the online training
   practices IS sympathisers adopt to recruit, indoctrinate, train, and vet
   new affiliates. The study highlights the carefully crafted virtual
   ecosystem established by IS unofficial media operatives, which seeks to
   identify and select converts with specialised digital skills and
   unwavering commitment to the group's vision of Islam. Prioritising
   quality over quantity, the selection process subjects new recruits to
   rigorous pre-and post-selection trials to ensure their authenticity,
   devotion, and obedience. Oaths of allegiance are central to membership
   within this virtual ecosystem, engendering a master-apprentice dynamic
   that may secure new recruits' adherence to assigned duties within the
   network. The instructional scaffolding within this ecosystem comprises
   two main constituents: theological indoctrination and digital training.
   The former places emphasis on IS's allegedly authentic religious sources
   in teaching Islamic jurisprudence, while the latter includes training on
   online security and media campaigns. As sympathisers progress through
   the ranks within the virtual ecosystem, they are empowered by their
   newly achieved ``veteran{''} status to take on leadership roles within
   the digital sphere or engage in combat operations. The meticulously
   engineered architecture of social hierarchies within the network is
   designed to foster loyalty and obedience, perpetuate a hierarchical
   fraternity, thereby enhancing the organisation's resilience and
   longevity.},

Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {95},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Unlike most immigration policy areas amidst Brexit, the government's
   `hostile environment' approach has changed little since 2014, despite it
   making no measurable impact on the migration statistics the government
   prioritises, while landing it in hot water over the Windrush scandal.
   Why does the hostile environment nevertheless persist? Despite its
   strong association with today's Conservatives, the hostile environment
   extends a decades-long trend of deepening various social systems'
   involvement in UK immigration control, creating increasing problems when
   long-settled immigrants face suspicion at vulnerable life stages. Yet,
   the hostile environment provides a way to pursue legitimacy in
   immigration control given the UK state's particular limitations and
   pressures: it demonstrates action against `illegal immigration', avoids
   revealing earlier control lapses and averts difficult reforms, like
   national identification cards, to monitor the population more
   thoroughly. The risks of this approach have only increased as Brexit has
   unsettled migration statuses, yet the hostile environment will likely
   remain.},

Abstract = {This paper argues against the idea of climate change refugeehood.
   Drawing on political realism, it reconstructs the idea and function of
   refugeehood in international politics. Refugees are not the agencyless
   victims merely in search of rescue by states of the Global North, as the
   idea of climate refugeehood as a form of humanitarian refugeehood would
   have it. Nor are they simply a function of reparative justice, or of
   defending international state legitimacy. To liberal democracies,
   refugees are those fleeing political oppression. They hold an important
   political function in inter-state relations in undermining rival
   political systems and strengthening liberal democratic regimes, both
   ideally and materially. The idea of climate refugeehood collides with
   the role refugeehood plays in international politics, the reasons for
   their admission, and the conceptualization of their plight and function.
   It ought, hence, to be rejected.},

Abstract = {John Locke was a social contract theorist. He envisaged that individuals
   had domiciled in a state of nature, enjoying natural rights. But because
   of the insecurities of the natural state, individuals transitioned to
   the stability of civil society, guaranteed by a sovereign. There were
   fetters on the sovereign, however, such as passing laws for the public
   good. Is modern legislation to counter terrorism for the public good?
   Locke also expressly granted a right of resistance on the people. But is
   this right terrorism? Reflecting on these principles, this study
   examines counter-terror statutes and determines whether Locke would
   support them.},

Journal = {INSIGHT TURKEY},
Year = {2024},

Number = {3},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {This commentary examines the implications of Yahya Sinwar's election as
   the new head of Hamas following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. It
   highlights Hamas' internal adaptability and the significance of its
   electoral processes in a context marked by external pressures and
   regional dynamics. The assassination is analyzed not only as a tactical
   operation by Israeli forces but also as a strategic move aimed at
   destabilizing Hamas internally and undermining its regional alliances,
   including efforts toward Palestinian reconciliation. Sinwar's leadership
   is framed within the broader historical and organizational context of
   Hamas, emphasizing his rise due to his involvement in key military
   operations and his status as a founding member. The commentary further
   explores the potential ramifications of Sinwar's leadership for Hamas'
   organizational cohesion and regional relations, particularly in light of
   Operation al-Aqsa Flood and the anticipated role of external actors like
   Iran and Hezbollah. Ultimately, this analysis sheds light on how Hamas
   navigates its internal challenges and external relationships amid
   ongoing conflict, underscoring the complexities that define its
   political trajectory in a rapidly changing regional landscape.},

Abstract = {The Russian Federation is the state that aims at achieving world

   culture and entertainment, t, it was determined that Russia uses all
   channels of it in the countries of the post-Soviet space, e, which are
   outlined through the concept of the `Near Abroad'. d'. In the group of
   tools, most widely used, d, are those from cultural, l, entertainment
   and media areas. A distinguishing tool for Russia is the dissemination
   of the `Russian World (Russkii Mir)' model. l. It has been outlined that
   Russia is projecting its sharp power in a visible aspect on a number of
   countries of the Near Abroad, d, in particular, r, Kazakhstan, n, the
   Baltic states, Ukraine and Georgia. a. In addition, n, based on a number

   `sharp power' r' is the increase and strengthening of authoritarian
   practices in the states on which this sharp power is projected. d.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This research note uses district -level panel data from 1870s Sweden to
   estimate the effect of the electric telegraph on electoral turnout. We
   argue that the telegraph contributed to higher turnout since it
   connected local communities to a national communication network, making
   people more aware of election campaigns and national political issues
   and more motivated to vote. Previous studies of the turnout effects of
   new telecommunication technologies have examined the radio, television,
   and the internet, with mixed results. Unlike these later technologies,
   the telegraph was almost exclusively used to transmit information, not
   entertainment, and it did not replace an existing telecommunication
   technology. Our empirical findings suggest that the telegraph had a
   positive effect on turnout, but only in areas with local newspapers that
   could benefit from the speedy access to national news.},

Abstract = {In its early months, the Syrian uprising included a diverse array of
   participants, including many from communities that the regime had
   previously assumed to be loyal, whether because of their sectarian
   identity, where they lived, or family ties to the military. The
   experiences of women from these communities can shed light on important
   aspects of the Syrian uprising, and test some of our key assumptions
   about women's participation in contentious politics and the gendered
   aspects of political violence. Based on interviews, this article engages
   with the work on gender and conflict in examining family connections and
   political grievances that drew many women to the opposition, the
   specifically gendered risks that they faced, and the advantages that
   some women felt their gender and sectarian identities gave them as
   organizers and activists.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the lived experience of citizenship of working-class
   girls from a marginalised ex-mining town in northern England engaged as
   community researchers in participatory action research. The research
   aimed to better understand the relationships within their local
   community. Qualitative methods were used to examine the girls'
   experience of the research and its impact on their sense of community,
   which is discussed using the lens of `lived citizenship' (Kallio et al.
   2020). We conclude that children's experience of participatory research
   approaches can be understood as subjective or lived citizenship. This
   contributes to understanding how they perceived their acts of
   citizenship, particularly in relation to others in their community.
   Supporting the international literature on subjectivity in citizenship
   studies and the critical appreciation of intersectionality in in
   participatory research, this paper demonstrates how such involvement can
   lead to positive subjective outcomes in groups experiencing
   marginalisation, such as working-class girls.},

Abstract = {The book, Accessible Elections: How the States Can Help Americans Vote
   (2020) from the Oxford University Press by Michael J. Ritter and
   Caroline J. Tolbert, examines how American state election laws and
   administrative provisions impact voter turnout, turnout equality, and
   campaign activity in the USA. Recently, this book was the centerpiece of
   an author-meets-critics ``Accessible Elections{''} roundtable discussion
   at the 2023 American Political Science Association conference, a
   roundtable replete with numerous experts on American and French election
   studies. Promoting a Franco-American comparative election studies
   research dialogue was a key goal of this roundtable and the resulting
   essays. This essay summarizes, examines, and explores the Accessible
   Elections research, the roundtable discussion, similarities and
   dissimilarities between the American and French electoral systems, and
   foreshadows possible areas of future comparative election studies
   research. The ``Accessible Voting{''} roundtable discussion and the
   resulting essays offer key insights regarding elections and democracy in
   the USA, France, and other countries.},

Abstract = {Refugees drown, are beaten, and are pushed back at the borders of the
   states of the Global North. Moral outrage is understandable in the face
   of such treatment. But does it constitute a good political theory? Can
   morality supply us with good normative arguments for a political world?
   In this article, I argue that they cannot. Drawing on political realism,
   I show why moral arguments for admitting refugees fail. What we require
   is not the extrapolation of moral arguments onto a political world, but
   a new form of political normativity that is derived from how politics
   works. I show that refugeehood possesses a specific political function
   in international politics. States do not admit refugees based on
   humanitarian reasons. This is what moral arguments get wrong. Rather,
   they fulfill the political function of condemning and embarrassing other
   states, of building oppositional and military forces to undermine rival
   political systems both ideologically and materially. In other words,
   they play an important political role-a role that allows us to build
   normative arguments from within a political and not a moral
   understanding of the world.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a new explanation for autocracies' political
   stability by focusing on the role of changes in asymmetric public
   perceptions of different policy dimensions. We show that the probability
   of policies enabling the provision of public goods on one dimension
   alone increases with the opacity of public perception. In turn, this
   implies that the probability of coups and revolts has a non-monotonic
   behavior in asymmetric opacity. Thus, transitional periods with changes
   in public perception might lead to an increase in the probability of
   coup and revolt attempts, reducing autocratic stability, and thereby
   altering some established ideas in the literature.},

Abstract = {How do international crises unfold? We conceptualize international
   relations as a strategic chess game between adversaries and develop a
   systematic way to measure pieces, moves, and gambits accurately and
   consistently over a hundred years of history. We introduce a new
   ontology and dataset of international events called ICBe based on a very
   high-quality corpus of narratives from the International Crisis Behavior
   (ICB) Project. We demonstrate that ICBe has higher coverage, recall, and
   precision than existing state of the art datasets and conduct two
   detailed case studies of the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962) and the
   Crimea-Donbas Crisis (2014). We further introduce two new event
   visualizations (event iconography and crisis maps), an automated
   benchmark for measuring event recall using natural language processing
   (synthetic narratives), and an ontology reconstruction task for
   objectively measuring event precision. We make the data, supplementary
   appendix, replication material, and visualizations of every historical
   episode available at a companion website crisisevents.org.},

Abstract = {This conceptual article explores the relationship between stakeholder
   theory and electoral processes, focusing on the contemporary challenges
   and ethical implications of applying this theory, rooted in
   accountability, to the political realm. Drawing on an extensive
   literature review to develop the theory within the political field and
   elections, the analysis uncovers the factors and multifaceted issues
   that shape stakeholder engagement in electoral contexts, and the
   pervasive influence of political money on the sway of tribal
   affiliations and identity politics-which can result in misaligned
   representation and unfair policy outcomes that may harm the long-term
   interests of stakeholders themselves. This underscores the need for
   regulatory reforms to enhance transparency and accountability in
   elections, advocating for ethical governance to balance broader public
   interests against narrow stakeholder interests. Ultimately, the research
   provides insights into improving global electoral processes and
   governance, calling for policies supporting equitable, accountable, and
   sustainable governance practices.},

Abstract = {Why do individuals defect from the partisan pull of their social
   identities? Previous explanations of social sorting often neglect to
   account for these defectors whose partisanship cannot be explained by
   simply tallying up their social identities. I call these individuals
   political heretics. To better understand this phenomenon, I leverage
   white evangelicals, one of the most socially and politically sorted
   groups in the United States, who support the Democratic Party as a case
   study. I find that, based upon 68 face-to-face interviews across seven
   churches, two explanations emerge that explain their heresy. First, some
   find their way into Democratic congregations that shield them from the
   pressure exerted by residing in a religious tradition that has undergone
   extensive political sorting. Second, some choose to remain in
   predominately Republicans churches and offset the cost of this political
   pressure with some other benefit. However, for those who choose the
   latter, electing to remain in a church where they are in the political
   minority, they face significant headwinds to either update their
   political preferences or leave. Despite these embattled defectors
   choosing to remain in Republican congregations, the pressure of
   polarization may eventually force them out.},

Abstract = {Why do presidents authorize risky covert operations given the potential
   negative impact failure could have on their administrations? I utilize a
   case study analysis of President Barack Obama's decision to approve
   Operation Neptune Spear, the raid on the compound in Abbottabad,
   Pakistan to capture or kill al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. By
   developing the concept of the specter of failure, I assess the options
   and potential outcomes presented to the president prior to the
   operation. While it was ultimately a success, I argue the possibility of
   failure drove the president to maintain a robust decision-making
   process. This research provides further evidence that Obama acted as his
   own honest broker in the realm of national security. Additionally,
   evidence suggests the president and his advisors were influenced by
   history, especially Operation Eagle Claw, the failed attempt to rescue
   hostages from the U.S. embassy in Iran approved by President Jimmy
   Carter three decades prior. Additionally, while Vice President Joe Biden
   advised against the mission, his participation throughout the process
   improved Obama's assessment as well as informed his own choices upon
   entering the Oval Office as president a decade later.},

Abstract = {Despite his influence on those interested by leisure, Marx's own
   conception of leisure is rarely discussed. Insofar as it is, he is
   generally either thought to see leisure as free time or as indistinct
   from necessary labour in communist society. In this article, I suggest
   that by reading Capital and the Grundrisse through an Aristotelian lens,
   we can find a third potential conception of leisure in Marx, which
   shares three features in common with Aristotle's. Leisure is distinct
   from free time simpliciter, it is a ``state-condition{''} people are in
   when they perform ends in themselves, and it is constitutive of the
   final end. I conclude that adopting a conception of leisure grounded in
   this Marxian conception could have implications for contemporary debates
   around free time and the value of leisure goods like arts and culture.

Abstract = {Election-related violence is rampant in many developing countries that
   receive foreign aid. However, it is not well understood why voters often
   elect representatives who are associated with such violence. In this
   article, I investigate why voters might support politicians who resort
   to violence. I argue that the poor tend to vote for candidates who
   deliver tangible local benefits through foreign aid projects even when
   those candidates use violence during election periods. To support this
   argument, I conducted a nationwide survey in the Philippines that
   included an experiment about the effects of foreign aid and violence on
   voters' electoral support for a candidate. I find that poor voters who
   reside in a region where basic public goods and services are deficient
   are more likely to support a candidate whose district has received
   foreign aid, regardless of her alleged electoral violence. This research
   sheds light on a mechanism that links poverty to electoral violence in
   less developed countries. It also reveals an unintended consequence of
   foreign aid: increasing the likelihood of electoral violence.},

Abstract = {The subtext of this extended commentary for the 2024 Policy Studies
   Yearbook in Politics \& Policy is the crucial role that liberalism and
   civil rights must play in U.S. foreign policy if America is to be on the
   right side of history. Our explicit subject is the conflux of elite and
   populist forces that constantly work against such liberal-democratic
   engagement. It is no secret that today's MAGAism ({''}Make America Great
   Again{''}) wears many of the same antiliberal stripes as did postwar
   McCarthyism, which was its direct progenitor. Thanks largely to the
   center-right resistance of President Eisenhower, McCarthyism was
   ultimately held in check domestically. Unfortunately, that was not the
   case on the side of U.S. foreign policy, where tenacious strains of
   antiliberalism had a very long shelf life. Thus, McCarthyism ended up
   having its most durable impact in the developing world, where cozy
   relations with highly reactionary regimes were considered necessary in
   the face of communist inroads. At a time when liberalism was hitting its
   full stride on American soil, U.S. foreign policy was exporting a very
   different America abroad, and especially in Asia. Even domestically, the
   waspish virulence of McCarthyism was never eradicated. It simply
   hibernated, and in 2016, it came back with a vengeance in the even more
   truculent form of Trumpism. Once again, xenophobic populism is laying
   claim to U.S. foreign policy and savaging liberal internationalism. The
   entrenched progressivism that stood its ground against McCarthyism has
   long since eroded. MAGAism faces no obstacle comparable to the dynamic
   liberalism of the 1950s or the counterculture of the 1960s. Seen from
   the perspective of January 6, 2021, the old McCarthyism looks tame by
   comparison.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {How much influence does incumbency have on the way parties nominate
   candidates? I address this question in the context of Argentina,
   examining how political parties decide on candidate nomination methods
   for National Deputies. I argue that holding the governorship creates an
   imbalanced distribution of resources within a party, leading party
   factions to lean toward consensus in candidate selection and reducing
   the likelihood of choosing a primary election. Conversely, when a party
   lacks the governorship, its provincial party leader may have a weaker
   influence in deterring primary elections. I also theorize the various
   situations and resources governors can employ to discourage primary
   elections, including potential coattail effects, the option of seeking
   reelection, control over the primaries' selectorate, and control of the
   electoral calendar. To test my expectations, I employ a regression
   discontinuity design, focusing on governors and those who finished as
   runners-up in lower chamber elections from 1985 to 2023. My findings
   reveal that governor incumbency decreases the probability of holding a
   primary election. I conduct further analyses by examining subgroups,
   considering the governor's circumstances and the resources I previously
   theorized as factors influencing primary deterrence. I find that
   incumbency only deters primaries when the governor and National Deputies
   elections are concurrent, when the governor is not term-limited, and
   when they have control over the electorate and the electoral calendar.},

Abstract = {In the context of international relations between China and Latin
   America, this paper offers an innovative perspective by investigating
   the evolution of the relationship between the People's Republic of China
   and the Caribbean Community {[}CARICOM] over the past decade, with a
   distinctive emphasis on national power as a pivotal analytical
   framework. Against the backdrop of profound shifts in the international
   geostructure, marked by China's emergence as a regional-global power and
   the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative {[}BRI], the political,
   commercial, and financial dynamics between China and CARICOM member
   countries have experienced significant transformations. This study
   highlights its contribution by placing national power at the center of
   its theoretical approach, providing a unique insight into the
   complexities present in these relationships. The analysis is structured
   into five segments, accentuating CARICOM's geostructural
   exceptionalities and scrutinizing the participation of its member states
   in the BRI. This approach not only illuminates Sino-Caribbean relations
   but also enriches the broader theoretical framework within the field of
   international relations.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to present the idea that the tobacco
   epidemic, included in the World Health Organization's (WHO) documents,
   may have contributed to the success of the Framework Convention on
   Tobacco Control (FCTC). The tobacco epidemic as a construct was present
   in internal and official WHO documentation as well as in scientific
   publications of the tobacco control-oriented scientists who constituted
   the anti-tobacco epistemic community. Using a qualitative approach, I
   analyzed three sets of texts to describe the features of the tobacco
   epidemic and how it may have contributed to the success of the FCTC. The
   methodology of the analysis was based on the sociological concept of
   medicalization. I argue that by virtue of medicalized framing in the
   case of the FCTC, the WHO was able to influence the debate on tobacco
   control.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this work is to describe and understand the contexts in
   which disputes emerge over the hegemonic meanings of human rights
   discourses. With the arrival of Cambiemos government s (2015-2019), the
   meaning of the discourse established until then began to be disputed. It
   is argued that the existence of a context of high political polarization
   together with the positioning in the state and media agenda of
   alternative elements to those that characterize the hegemonic discourse,
   are presented as possible factors that affect this process. In order to
   carry out the proposed objective, a corpus was formed and analyzed from
   the speeches of different actors, official communications, management
   reports, and three relevant facts on the matter were analyzed.},

Journal = {PENSAMIENTO AL MARGEN},
Year = {2024},
Number = {20},
Month = {MAY-DEC},
Abstract = {This essay reflects on the relationship between water, landscape, and
   its representation, using the figure of the meander as a starting point
   to explore the river's temporality and how it interacts with its
   environment. It then examines how waterfalls resist being captured in
   maps, and how tourist images of them, produced in Chile during the
   dictatorship, diverted attention from political excesses. Likewise,
   photographs of waterfalls reveal a tension between the desire to freeze
   the movement of water and its continuous flow, which challenges the
   perception of water as a manageable and static resource. Through these
   images and concepts, the essay critiques the utilitarian view of water,
   proposing instead an approach that recognizes it as an integral part of
   the social, thereby expanding understanding to a hydrosocial cycle that
   challenges hegemonic scientific simplifications.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of a 2022 investigation into the
   reintegration model of the CCP Biob \& iacute;o concessioned prison
   located in the Chilean region that bears that same name. The research
   focuses on a case study using the methodology of documentary analysis
   that examines how policies and programs are constituted in the framework
   through which social reintegration processes are worked. Among the
   findings, serious deficiencies of the model were identified that
   question the possibility of achieving social reintegration in the
   tendered penitentiary system, revealing first of all the need to make
   significant adjustments to achieve effective resocialization processes,
   in addition management through tender limits flexibility and slows down
   the changes. Finally, it is proposed to redefine the perspectives of
   reintegration, incorporating broader paradigms that involve
   collaboration between government actors, social policies and private
   entities as a fundamental axis to mitigate the damage caused by the
   deprivation of liberty.},

Abstract = {Can engagement with far-right social media communities socialize users
   into a new political identity? This study addresses concerns about the
   spread of far-right groups on mainstream social media platforms by
   examining how newcomers are affected by their engagement with these
   groups. I theorize that changes in social identity expression indicative
   of socialization will be measurable in the language users use to express
   themselves on social media, and that the magnitude of this linguistic
   change will intensify with more frequent far-right engagement. I develop
   a custom dictionary of far-right-relevant terms sourced from communities
   like The Daily Stormer and Stormfront. Using an original dataset of
   Reddit user posting histories from 2015-2017, I test for increases in
   the frequency of this far-right vocabulary. I find that users who engage
   often with a far-right community like r/The\_Donald begin to sound more
   like white nationalists within three months. Socialized users also use
   far-right vocabulary more frequently in other spaces on their platform,
   contributing to the spread and normalization of far-right rhetoric.},

Abstract = {The definition of genocide employed by the United Nations is criticized
   for failing to protect certain groups from abuses conducted by state
   entities. Drawing from the case study of Romania, this article explores
   how the narrow definition of genocide impacts the assessment and
   prosecution of charges of genocide during the process of transition from
   communism to democracy. Furthermore, drawing on Axel Honneth's theory of
   recognition, the research explores how this restrictive interpretation
   of genocide undermines victims' claims to justice and recognition,
   revealing that the strict interpretation of genocide hinders
   transitional justice efforts and erodes trust in state institutions.},

Abstract = {In this paper I discuss how and to what extent core elements of Beatrice
   Han-Pile's account of a constitutive experience of powerlessness at the
   centre of hope can be fruitfully transferred to a collective political
   level. Despite its constitutive relation to uncertainty, we often talk
   about the power of hope as a motivating and activating force that helps
   us to cope with challenges, overcome obstacles and pursue plans. Hoping
   with an awareness of the limitations of one's individual power can at
   the same time be a strong motivation for acting in concert and thereby
   establishing power as a collective practice. I will explore how
   democratic hope that is empowering participation can be distinguished
   from disempowering political hopes. Finally, I will argue that
   integrating experiences of relative powerlessness and reflecting them
   explicitly is constitutive for `strong democratic hope', while the
   experience of powerlessness can remain pre-reflective on the individual
   psychological level. At the same time strong democratic hope is directed
   towards preventing experiences of radical powerlessness.},

Abstract = {Despite record numbers of internally displaced persons (IDPs) globally,
   we know little about the causal effects of intergroup contact between
   migrants and locals in active conflict settings. We conduct a randomized
   controlled trial of a vocational skills-training program implemented by
   Mercy Corps that enrolled 2597 locals and migrants in near equal numbers
   in Kandahar, Afghanistan, where IDPs face daily prejudice and
   discrimination. Courses lasting up to 6 months emphasized collaborative
   learning and soft skills development. We surveyed participants at
   endline and followed up 8 months later. While the program provided the
   most sustained duration of intergroup contact (360-720 h) experimentally
   evaluated to date, we find no evidence of reported behavioral or
   attitudinal change by locals (N = 1276) toward migrants generally,
   regardless of classroom demographics or course duration. Our findings
   suggest that prolonged contact through vocational training programs is
   insufficient to improve relations in conflict settings.},

Abstract = {Long-term leaders tend to cast long shadows that give their successors a
   hard time. This article puts forward an argument that assesses the
   nature of those challenges and the different ways of dealing with them,
   with a focus on incumbents' leadership styles. At its core, the article
   looks into the historical evolution of the German chancellorship, which
   has been marked by three extended incumbencies (Konrad Adenauer, Helmut
   Kohl and Angela Merkel). The key focus of this comparative assessment
   is, however, on their strikingly different successors - Ludwig Erhard,
   Gerhard Schroder and Olaf Scholz. While Erhard and Schroder tried to
   break free from their predecessors' legacy, Olaf Scholz went out of his
   way to present himself as `another Merkel', if more in terms of
   leadership style than policy. The three case studies suggest that
   successions tend to involve a strategic element, yet incoming leaders
   are not entirely free to invent a role for themselves. While they face
   particular expectations, they have to remain true to their personality
   and adopt a leadership style that does not damage their authenticity.
   This is a formidable task, as their predecessors' legacies that shape
   their own perceived performance are not static but evolve over time.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the thesis of threatened social identities as a
   new explanatory approach to the emergence of populist attitudes and
   tests it explicitly for the first time using quantitative data. We
   examine whether SIT indicators explain populist attitudes directly and
   influence effects of indicators of two established approaches: the
   losers of modernization thesis (LOM) and the cultural backlash thesis
   (CBT). We use a sample representative for the German labor force.
   Furthermore, we developed items to quantify the recognition of social
   identities for the first time with respect to social class and
   occupational identities. All four of our SIT indicators-recognition of
   social class, recognition of an East or West German identity, political
   recognition of occupational groups, and identity insecurity-are
   significant predictors of populist attitudes. Based on SEMs, we also
   conclude that these variables are important antecedents of previously
   established indicators of LOM and CBT on populist attitudes. Overall, we
   conclude that SIT adds to the literature on the emergence of populism as
   another complementary explanatory approach. In addition to being
   effective as an explanation in its own right, this thesis can also fill
   theoretical and empirical gaps of the established LOM and CBT.},

Title = {Breaking the Mold: Normative Hybridity as the Key to Contemporary
   ``Non-Western{''} Political Theorizing},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {119},

Abstract = {What normative compass can appropriately ground a theory for
   contemporary ``non-Western{''} societies? This question has become
   urgent amid the pressure to decolonize political science and academia.
   The hybridity of numerous contemporary non-Western societies means that
   political theorists cannot refuse to engage with either
   Western-originated or premodern Indigenous concepts and ways of thinking
   that bear on the local public culture. However, these normative strands
   alone are unsuitable for grounding a contemporary theory. This
   methodological dilemma can be overcome if theorists adopt normative
   hybridity as a methodological stance. Normative hybridity suggests that
   hybridity is not only a feature of the theorist's context of reference
   but should also be their modus operandi. Normative hybridity already
   underpins relevant works in contemporary Confucian political theory.
   Drawing from these works, I illustrate three methods to apply normative
   hybridity to theory building. This novel methodological approach
   uniquely addresses current political theory discussions and influences
   non-Western policymaking.},

Abstract = {Debates on allies' contributions to alliances focus mainly on the
   material dimension. Accordingly, smaller partners are often belittled
   for failing to contribute their fair share to their defensive alliances
   with more powerful allies. While acknowledging that junior partners'
   contributions do not match the same level of material capabilities
   provided by a more significant power like the United States, this study
   highlights the importance of other intangible contributions. We argue
   that defensive alliances during peacetime require a crucial, albeit
   overlooked, ideational contribution by all allies. We examine the
   US-Japan and ANZUS alliances to explore the process through which junior
   partners advance the interests of an alliance through ideational
   contributions. Our findings reveal that Japan and Australia contribute
   to their respective alliances with the United States by mobilizing
   fundamental ideas and norms that sustain and promote a specific global
   order and security vision. We maintain that such intangible
   contributions are necessary for alliance success.},

Abstract = {Democratic institutions were seriously challenged across Europe between
   1917 and 1939. In 1920, most European states were parliamentary
   democracies, by 1939 the majority had become authoritarian. However,
   some states weathered the crises they faced and successfully maintained
   democracy. There is a significant literature on democratic breakdown,
   but considerable attention has now been given to those that survived.
   This paper revisits the question of democratic survival by focussing on
   the Irish Free State and its experience when compared with other
   European states. It argues that while the Irish Free State was fragile
   in a comparative context, sharing many of the challenges associated with
   breakdown, it also showed considerable resilience. Various factors
   associated with survival and breakdown are critically assessed to
   explain the positive Irish outcome.},

Journal = {NATIONAL IDENTITIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 10},
Abstract = {This article investigates how Danish news media and popular culture
   represent war veterans and how the dominant form of representation can
   be linked to a general process of militarization in a Danish context.
   Focusing on the narratives and representations of Danish veterans allow
   for a study of how the veteran emerges as culturally significant figure
   in a Nordic welfare state without a well-established tradition for
   international military engagement. By reading across a set of newspaper
   articles and two popular TV series, Ride upon the storm and Warrior, a
   dominant pathologizing discourse focusing on the veteran-victim is
   identified and discussed.},

Abstract = {Does good governance require citizens to be knowledgeable of basic facts
   and best policy ideas? Some scholars suggest that it does, and propose
   disenfranchising the most `ignorant' voters. In contrast, we argue,
   political systems are complex systems inevitably exhibiting incomplete,
   imperfect and asymmetric information that is dynamically generated in
   society from actors with diverse life experiences, antagonistic
   interests and often profoundly dissonant views and values, generating
   radical uncertainty among political elites over the consequences of
   their decisions. Radical uncertainty, radical dissonance and power
   asymmetry are inescapable properties of politics. Good performance
   significantly depends on how political elites navigate through radical
   uncertainty to handle radical dissonance. Democracy, by offering
   citizens equal rights to participate in politics and talk freely, both
   enables and compels political actors to track social feedback regarding
   the effects of their decisions on a diverse public, and consider it in
   ways that mitigate these three problems.},

Abstract = {A growing body of research theorizes that partisanship can undermine
   democracy as citizens prioritize their political interests over abstract
   norms and values. We argue that crises might counteract intense
   partisanship by giving citizens clarity on the threats posed by rule of
   law violations. Examining the differential application of a law - a
   breach of democratic norms - we draw on an experiment embedded in
   representative surveys of Germany, the United States, Hungary and Poland
   to examine citizens' sense of appropriate punishment for elites'
   violation of a municipal mask-wearing ordinance. We find evidence of
   partisan bias in citizens' willingness to support punishment in all four
   countries. But, in the two consolidated democracies, we find that
   concern about the Covid-19 crisis diminishes partisan biases in
   punishment preferences: citizens who are most concerned about the crisis
   also model the most consistency in their willingness to hold copartisans
   into account.},

Abstract = {The system of government has been a significant issue in Turkish
   politics intermittently since the transition to multi-party politics.
   Subsequently, especially political party leaders from the right-wing
   spectrum claimed that Turkey should change the parliamentary system to a
   presidential system due to the need for a fast and powerful executive
   branch. Following the constitutional changes in 2017, the parliamentary
   system was replaced by the presidential system of government. However,
   the debate on the system of government remains unresolved. The
   opposition side in Turkey, gathered as the Nation Alliance, comprising
   the Republican People's Party (CHP), the nationalist IYIP party, the
   Islamist Felicity Party (SP), the Democratic Party (DP), the Democracy
   and Progress Party (DEVA), and the Future Party (GP), has proposed a new
   system, the strengthened parliamentary system, for Turkey's
   democratization process in 2022. They criticize the presidential system
   for leading to a more authoritarian regime than before the
   constitutional changes in 2017. The study aims to understand how social
   media users on Twitter (X) reflect on the Nation Alliance's proposal for
   transitioning to a strengthened parliamentary system. To achieve this,
   we will analyze the tweets about this issue using content analysis,
   social network analysis, and sentiment analysis. In conclusion, this
   research delves into the challenges of democracy in Turkey by analyzing
   debates on the Strengthened Parliamentary System (SPS). It highlights
   limited public interest, polemical political discussions, and the
   harmful impact of securitizing democratic demands related to the SPS.
   The analysis emphasizes the weak connection of the SPS project with the
   general public, lack of democratic dialogue within the opposition, and
   the government's strategy of framing the SPS as a security matter,
   offering insights into the complex dynamics influencing Turkey's
   democratization process.
   Das Regierungssystem war seit der Einfuhrung des Mehrparteiensystems ein
   bedeutendes Thema, das die turkische Politik von Zeit zu Zeit
   beschaftigt hat. Insbesondere politische Parteifuhrer aus dem rechten
   Spektrum haben seit dieser Zeit behauptet, dass die Turkei aufgrund der
   Notwendigkeit eines schnellen und kraftvollen Exekutivorgans vom
   parlamentarischen System auf ein prasidentielles System umstellen
   sollte. Nach den Verfassungsanderungen im Jahr 2017 wurde das
   parlamentarische System durch das Prasidialsystem ersetzt. Andererseits
   ist die Uneinigkeit uber das Regierungssystem noch nicht beigelegt. Die
   Oppositionsseite in der Turkei, die als Nationenbundnis besteht und aus
   der Republikanischen Volkspartei (CHP), der nationalistischen IYIP, der
   islamistischen Saadet-Partei (SP), der Demokratischen Partei (DP), der
   Demokratie und Fortschrittspartei (DEVA) und der Zukunftspartei (GP)
   besteht, hat fur den Demokratisierungsprozess der Turkei im Jahr 2022
   ein neues System vorgeschlagen, das gestarkte parlamentarische System.
   Sie kritisierten das Prasidialsystem dafur, dass es zu einem autoritaren
   Regime gefuhrt habe, im Vergleich zur Zeit vor den Verfassungsanderungen
   im Jahr 2017. Das Ziel dieser Studie ist es, die Reflexionen der Nutzer
   sozialer Medien auf Twitter (X) uber den Vorschlag des
   Nationenbundnisses fur den ubergang zu einem gestarkten
   parlamentarischen System zu verstehen. Zu diesem Zweck werden wir die
   Tweets zu diesem Thema mithilfe von Inhaltsanalyse, sozialer
   Netzwerkanalyse und Stimmungsanalyse analysieren. Zusammenfassend
   untersucht diese Forschung die Herausforderungen der Demokratie in der
   Turkei durch die Analyse der Debatten uber das ,Gestarkte
   Parlamentarische System' (GPS). Sie hebt das begrenzte offentliche
   Interesse, polemische politische Diskussionen und die schadlichen
   Auswirkungen der Sicherheitsbewertung demokratischer Forderungen im
   Zusammenhang mit dem SPS hervor. Die Analyse betont die schwache
   Verbindung des SPS-Projekts zur allgemeinen offentlichkeit, das Fehlen
   demokratischer Dialoge innerhalb der Opposition und die Strategie der
   Regierung, das SPS als Sicherheitsfrage darzustellen. Damit liefert sie
   Einblicke in die komplexen Dynamiken, die den Demokratisierungsprozess
   in der Turkei beeinflussen.},

Abstract = {The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine was a watershed moment in European
   politics. The invasion prompted a massive influx of refugees into
   Central Europe, a region in which immigration has proven highly
   contentious and politically salient in recent decades. We study public
   opinion toward refugees in Hungary, a highly exclusionary political
   environment in which anti-migrant and anti-refugee sentiments are
   commonly invoked by the ruling government. Combining historical public
   opinion data from the past decade with two rounds of original survey
   data from 2022, we demonstrate that the Ukrainian refugee crisis was
   accompanied by a large increase in tolerance for refugees, reversing
   what had previously been one of the most anti-refugee public opinion
   environments in Europe. To explain this reversal, we use a series of
   survey experiments coupled with detailed settlement-level demographic
   data to investigate how conflict proximity and racial, religious, and
   national identity shape openness to refugees. We find that the
   distinguishing feature of the 2022 refugee crisis was that refugees were
   mostly white European Christians driven from their home country by
   conflict. We discuss the implications of our argument for Hungary, for
   European politics in times of crisis, and for the politics of public
   opinion in competitive authoritarian regimes.},

Abstract = {This short commentary is part of a book symposium about Marxist-Feminist
   Theories and Struggles Today: Essential Writings on Intersectionality,
   Labour and Ecofeminism, edited by Khayaat Fakier, Diana Mulinari, and
   Nora R \& auml;thzel. It discusses certain chapters from a French
   materialist lesbian feminist perspective, as well as from a decolonial
   feminist perspective. Introducing Colette Guillaumin's sexage proposal
   and referring to Monique Wittig's analysis of the heterosexualization of
   women and of the ``straight mind,{''} the essay recalls the importance
   of Black feminists in the United States and elsewhere and proposes a
   theory of the interlocking social-structural relations of sex, race, and
   class as complementary elements moving toward a renewal of
   Marxist-feminist reflections from a historical perspective that also
   accounts for the colonial roots of today's discussions on care and
   reproductive labor.},

Abstract = {This article shows that larger legislatures reduce the electoral power
   of incumbent parties in the executive. The electoral effects of
   legislature size have been largely overlooked by a literature that
   emphasizes its impact on policies. I estimate the effects of municipal
   council size on the performance of the local incumbent party in
   gubernatorial, presidential, and mayoral races in Brazil. The regression
   discontinuity design exploits variation from a law that set nonlinear
   council size caps after 2012. In a nutshell, every additional seat
   triggers a 5 percentage point vote loss for the candidates backed by the
   mayor's party. Additional evidence suggests that these losses are a
   consequence of a breakdown in the political brokerage relationships that
   often characterize developing democracies: in Brazil, mayors exchange
   patronage for the councilors' electoral support. Larger councils raise
   this transaction cost for mayors, more so when the council and mayor
   have unaligned electoral incentives at the state/national levels.},

Abstract = {The urgency of this research lies in the need to understand the trends,
   contributions, and dynamics of women's political participation globally.
   This article aims to map studies that focus on women's political
   participation. Research methods include bibliometric analysis with data
   sources from the Scopus database. The study's findings reflect
   significant growth in women's political participation research,
   especially in recent years, with distribution varying by country and
   research theme. The research findings also show that although there are
   themes that have received attention, there are still areas that need to
   be explored further, such as intersectionality, gender equality, gender,
   and the impact of social media that provide insight into the complexity
   of women's political participation issues. This study recommends the
   need for increased research and local understanding of the factors
   influencing women's political participation in Indonesia to strengthen
   women's role in politics by learning from other countries that have
   successfully implemented inclusive policies. In addition, by involving
   various parties, including the government, research institutions, and
   civil society, Indonesia can create an environment that supports,
   empowers, and encourages women's political participation optimally. The
   implications of these findings not only help shape academic discourse,
   but also lay the foundation for concrete efforts to achieve gender
   equality and women's empowerment in the wider political sphere.},

Title = {Taking stock of the multilevel governance research programme: a
   systematic literature review},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 28},
Abstract = {Multilevel governance (MLG) is one of the most successful ideas in
   contemporary political scholarship. Coined in the early 1990s by Gary
   Marks to examine developments in the European Union's regional policy,
   MLG has since been adopted and further elaborated in numerous
   publications, which have expanded the concept well beyond its initial
   context, and afforded it wide currency in academic and policy-making
   circles. As the term turns thirty, this article maps MLG scholarship by
   presenting the first systematic review of this literature, based on a
   dataset of 590 publications. In particular, the article identifies key
   conceptual and empirical developments in MLG studies, assesses strengths
   and weaknesses of existing research, and informs future work by locating
   gaps and suggesting directions. By examining MLG research
   comprehensively, the article also provides a solid basis on which future
   scholarship may, possibly, reassess some of the longstanding
   `existential' questions on multilevel governance as a research
   programme.},

Abstract = {The White House Chief of Staff (COS) has become the modern presidency's
   organizational lynchpin, the position tasked with helping presidents
   ``faithfully execute the Office of President.{''} Extending a rich
   literature about how chiefs manage White House staffers, we consider the
   other side of the coin: can a COS manage the president? We begin
   theoretically, sketching three mechanisms-offloading, streamlining, and
   steering-by which a COS could shape presidents' basic workways. We test
   resulting hypotheses against original data on presidents' daily work
   behaviors from John F. Kennedy to George W. Bush-a total spanning 48
   years, nine presidencies, and 21 Chiefs of Staff (plus one sustained
   vacancy). Surprisingly, we find little evidence that Chiefs of Staff
   affected the duration, density, or composition of their president's
   workday. When it comes to the basic contours of presidential workways,
   it appears Chiefs of Staff do less ``managing up{''} and more ``managing
   around.{''}},

Abstract = {Contrary to the established belief that low agricultural prices fuel
   peasant rebellion, our study investigates the surge in peasant unrest
   during a period of high agricultural prices. The transition to
   capital-intensive agriculture, characterized by reduced labor demand and
   heightened entry barriers, prompts landowners to expand into the
   agricultural frontier during periods of price increases. In these
   frontier regions, the soils, while comparatively less suitable, become
   economically viable for commercial agriculture when crop prices are
   high. This scenario sets the stage for heightened collective resistance,
   particularly where organizational capacities and subsistence communities
   provide peasants with symbolic and material resources to resist land
   encroachment. We provide evidence of this argument by using unique
   municipal-level data from Paraguay between 2000 and 2014, a period of
   rising yet fluctuating prices. Our study shows how the interplay between
   technological advancements in agriculture and global market forces
   reshape the geography of peasant rebellion.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {88},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Age is possibly the strongest known individual-level socio-demographic
   determinant of participation in elections. Despite its substantial
   influence in shaping electoral outcomes, evidence-based understanding of
   the steep decline in turnout at older ages is scarce. We suggest that
   time-related proximity to death and the associated decline in cognitive
   and physical functioning may explain this relationship. With full
   population data on the participation of the 65+ year -old electorate in
   the 1999 parliamentary elections in Finland linked to a more than 21
   -year mortality follow-up, we demonstrate that the remaining lifetime is
   a more powerful predictor of voting than age, often by an order of
   magnitude. These results offer a novel theoretical principle into
   understanding the fundamental age-related decline in electoral
   participation at older ages: It is not the time from the cradle, but the
   time to the grave, that counts more.},

Abstract = {While the networking nature of social media opens up opportunities for
   nonprofit e-advocacy, nonprofits' coalition building through social
   media remains an understudied area of research. Drawing on previous
   research, we collected longitudinal Twitter data of nonprofit homeless
   shelters in the United States. By conducting a series of network and
   textual analyses, this study seeks to understand how social media's
   connecting tools are used by shelter providers over time. We also
   observe the interorganizational networks that developed over time to
   examine whether online coalitions are built in the homelessness field.
   Results indicate that while nonprofit homeless shelters tend to
   underutilize the potential of social media for inter-organizational
   networking, the inter-organizational network tends to develop into a set
   of more complicated and stronger ties.},

Abstract = {Within the context of eliciting partner country cooperation and
   interests alignment, U.S. presidents and their administrations have a
   wide array of policy tools at their disposal to mitigate terrorist
   threats emanating from other countries. Yet, the factors that account
   for variation in American presidents' and their administrations'
   specific counterterrorism policy choices to influence target states'
   behavior remain underexplored. To understand the underlying factors that
   influence the adoption of different U.S. counterterrorism tools within a
   given country, and their variation across administrations in the
   post-9/11 era, we examine the case of Pakistan-a challenging yet
   enduring partner in the U.S.-led Global War on Terror. Categorizing the
   counterterrorism policies and tools adopted by Presidents Bush, Obama,
   and Trump as punitive or nonpunitive policy decisions, we explore the
   extent to which each president's policy choices during the Global War on
   Terror were largely a continuation of predecessors or responded to
   specific shifting patterns of terrorism within Pakistan. Our study
   yields important insights regarding the extent to which path dependency
   or evolving security environments shape choices of counterterrorism
   tools.},

Abstract = {In India, armed groups characterised by a diversity of ideologies and
   aims have emerged and persisted even in the presence of a fairly strong
   state. These groups often operate in areas that have long suffered from
   state neglect. We examine how violent conflict influences patterns of
   birth registration. State-recognised documents are crucial for
   establishing legal identity, and accessing citizenship rights. We draw
   on the 2015-16 National Family and Health Survey to measure civil
   registration, community and household characteristics. Our conflict data
   come from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, which we leverage to
   describe community exposure to organised violence. Our statistical
   analysis shows that the likelihood that a child is in possession of a
   birth certificate is significantly lower in areas affected by violent
   conflict, even when controlling for other individual and social
   characteristics associated with marginalisation.},

Abstract = {Can redistributive policies such as land reform help authoritarian
   regimes coopt rural societies? Given that land reform has the potential
   to disrupt preexisting sociopolitical orders, this article highlights an
   unresolved puzzle of how regimes balance between the objectives of
   expanding its rural coalitional support through transformative
   redistribution and stabilizing its political control over rural
   institutions during land reform. Using a novel dataset of Taiwan's 1950s
   rural reforms under the Kuomintang authoritarian regime, I find that
   stronger redistributive effects facilitated cooptation of new land
   reform beneficiaries through a key institution - the farmers'
   association (FA). However, I also find that the restructuring of
   rank-and-file FA membership was still subject to meddling by the native
   landlord class. I thus argue that land reform, while allowing regimes to
   broaden their rural coalitions through socioeconomic redistribution, can
   also paradoxically compel regimes to concede power during institutional
   cooptation.},

Abstract = {Non-state armed actors' (NSAAs) control of territory is not a completely
   new phenomenon in international politics. However, NSAAs resurgence in
   the conceptualization and demarcation of both physical and imaginary
   territorial space has raised the need for a further understanding of
   their territorial logic. Non-state armed actors continue to seize,
   occupy, and control territory in a manner that undermines Westphalia
   tenets of statehood, including sovereignty, territorial integrity, and
   independence. This article attempts to shed some light on the
   understanding of the territorial logic of NSAAs by innovatively
   combining three independent and interrelated components that have
   emerged from NSAAs territorial control. These components include NSAA
   territorial governance, relations with local civilian populations and
   ideology guided territorial tactics and strategies. We apply the results
   to the typical and contemporary case of Al Shabaab in Somalia to
   generate critical insights into NSAA conceptualization, control and
   demarcation of physical and imaginary space.},

Abstract = {Ethnic identities around the world are deeply intertwined with modern
   statehood, yet the extent to which territorial governance has shaped
   ethnic groups is empirically unknown. I argue that governments at the
   national and subnational levels have incentives to bias governance in
   favor of large groups. The resulting disadvantages for ethnic minorities
   motivate their assimilation and emigration. Both gradually align ethnic
   groups with administrative borders. I examine the result of this process
   at subnational administrative borders across sub-Saharan Africa and use
   credibly exogenous, straight borders for causal identification. I find
   substantive increases in the local population share of administrative
   units' predominant ethnic group at units' borders. Powerful traditional
   authorities and size advantages of predominant groups increase this
   effect. Data on minority assimilation and migration show that both drive
   the shaping of ethnic groups along administrative borders. These results
   highlight important effects of the territorial organization of modern
   governance on ethnic groups.},

Abstract = {The East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) forms a key component of China's
   regional infrastructure plans while promising local development and
   enhanced economic growth. The project is also Beijing's answer to its
   ``Malacca Dilemma{''}. There are, however, immense challenges to the
   project, such as transparency, economic viability and local stakeholder
   concerns. This article analyses the geoeconomic regional implications of
   the ECRL and discusses the project in the context of Malaysia's internal

Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLICY},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen several waves of irregular migrants and asylum
   seekers from many different countries transit through Mexico and arrive
   at the US-Mexico border. Although the goal of these migrants is to cross
   into the United States, many find themselves stranded on the Mexican
   side of the border for various reasons, forced to insert themselves in
   its cities' urban spaces and activities. Their presence has forced
   government actors, the public and civil society organizations, and
   market players to deal with them. Each of these actors deploys different
   strategies to deal with the migrants' presence, all of which can be
   pinned on a spectrum of inclusion and exclusion, according to their
   interests and perception of the migrants' station in their midst. This
   article examines the practices of social inclusion and exclusion of
   migrants in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico, based on concepts by
   Bramley and Power, and outlines the challenges of inclusion for migrants
   and residents as both perceive their sojourn in the city as mainly
   transitory.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {88},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article compares the relationship between candidate age and
   political selection on the local and national level of politics. On
   which level are young candidates more likely to be selected by parties
   and elected by voters? Using register data from Finland, covering over
   100,000 candidates from 2011 to 2021, we test two competing hypotheses:
   the ``stepping stone{''} hypothesis relating to the traditional pipeline
   theory of political representation, and the ``parachute{''} hypothesis,
   which represents a non-hierarchical approach to political careers. Our
   findings provide slightly more support for the latter hypothesis. While
   national elections are more competitive, comparatively more young
   candidates are running in these contests. We also find that the
   electoral disadvantage for young candidates is slightly larger in
   municipal than in national elections. Based on election survey data, we
   show that is this due to age affinity effects within the electorate,
   where senior voters' candidate preferences have greater weight.},

Abstract = {How do populist voters differ from other voters and among themselves? I
   argue that the commonality of populist voters is a perceived sense of
   political inefficacy. The feelings of inefficacy interact with
   grievances, which determine the party choice. Using the European Social
   Survey data, I show that when grievances are cultural, voters are more
   likely to vote for a right-wing populist party. In the same manner,
   economic grievances make left-wing populist voting more likely.
   Furthermore, I show that negative effect of political efficacy on
   populist voting declines as grievances become more severe. Thus, while
   grievances determine the type of populism, political efficacy determines
   the vote choice between populist parties and their alternatives.},

Abstract = {In trust relationships, one person has a `beneficial interest' in
   another's performance. The former not only would but should benefit from
   the latter's action, and the latter has a `fiduciary duty' toward the
   former to so act. But where that act would otherwise be wrong, the first
   person's beneficial interest would be providing a pro tanto reason for
   the second person to do something that is pro tanto wrong. That reason
   can - and should - be removed by the former renouncing their beneficial
   interest in the latter's pro tanto wrongful action. Doing so would
   cancel the fiduciary's excuse for wrongdoing on the beneficiary's
   behalf.},

Abstract = {A growing literature seeks to bring agency into the study of
   movement-parties (M-Ps). Yet studies pay little attention to radical
   M-Ps which confront acute dilemmas when deciding to contest
   parliamentary elections in systems they deem illegitimate. This article
   problematizes radical M-Ps' entry in elections and the meaning they
   attribute to the role and function of elections - their epistemology of
   elections. We examine three M-Ps - Beirut Madinati, LiHaqqi, and
   Muwatinun wa Muwatinat fi Dawla. We demonstrate that radical M-Ps with a
   coherent strategy for political change, one that includes an
   epistemology of elections, are more likely to mitigate and survive
   electoral dilemmas when entering elections. Radical M-Ps lacking such a
   strategy risk fragmentation and potential dissolution. Methodologically,
   we chose Lebanon because 1) during the period under study, it is a
   democracy and, consequently, a relevant case study for theories of party
   formation; and 2) it offers a controlled comparison of M-Ps in
   elections. Moreover, all three M-Ps emerged during a similar
   time-period, with similar social bases, and, at least originally,
   radical positions. Research is based on participation in, and
   observation of, protests and elections between 2011 and 2022, as well as
   primary and secondary source.},

Abstract = {This article reports the findings from a 2023 survey that invited all
   MPs to evaluate the performance of postwar prime ministers from Clement
   Attlee to Liz Truss. It also compares MPs' responses with those from a
   similar survey conducted in 2013. Among the MPs who responded in 2023,
   Margaret Thatcher was ranked as the most successful postwar prime
   minister, and Truss was ranked as the least successful. The results
   further suggest that prime ministers' historical reputations among MPs
   are relatively sticky, closely associated with their length of tenure in
   10 Downing Street, and greatly affected by party loyalties. Lastly, the
   rankings based on parliamentary opinion in 2023 are broadly comparable
   with those based on recent surveys of academic and public opinion.},

Abstract = {What role do rebel governance structures play in deterring
   rebel-on-rebel violence? I argue that variation in rebel governance is
   an important factor. In 1990s South Africa, the African National
   Congress (ANC) and its armed wing, the MK, employed different governance
   strategies over pro-ANC militias. In the Sharpeville township, the MK
   imposed a hierarchical governance structure, which contributed to
   inter-factional ANC violence. In the Thokoza township, the ANC formed a
   cooperative governance structure between the ANC and the militias. As a
   result, Thokoza experienced less internecine conflict. Evidence for my
   argument comes from archival research and interviews with former pro-ANC
   militants.},

Abstract = {The literature on `institutional corruption' has paradoxically missed
   what seems a central application of this expression, its application to
   institutions that are corrupt. In this article, I defend a view of what
   it is for an institution to be corrupt, in terms of the motivation of
   the institution's rules. If an individual office-holder or role-occupant
   is corrupt when their actions are improperly motivated by private gain,
   then an institution is corrupt when the same can be said of its rules:
   the institution's rules are improperly motivated by private gain. Or if
   we should prefer a narrower account of corrupt conduct by individuals,
   as necessarily involving transactions with third parties, a
   correspondingly narrower account of an institution's corruptness can
   also be given. Under either of these versions of my view, an
   institution's being corrupt is to be distinguished from something else
   that might be called `institutional corruption', namely the corruption
   of institutions, in the sense of their being degraded or undermined. I
   argue that some of the literature's best-known accounts of
   `institutional corruption' are best interpreted as being about the
   degrading of institutions, rather than about what it is for an
   institution to be corrupt.},

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 9},
Abstract = {The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria's (ISIS) rise and fall has led to
   millions of Syrians and Iraqis' displacement. Many displaced now live in
   refugee camps, one of the largest is called `Al-Hawl', located in
   Syria's Hasakah province. A significant number of its residents are
   children, some of whom are affiliated with ISIS. Experts and
   international institutions warn that Al-Hawl's children could become the
   next leaders of jihadist ideologies and pose a threat to the security of
   the Middle East. Hence, our main question is `How can these children be
   the promoters of jihadist ideology like ISIS and threaten Middle Eastern
   security?' The objective of the present study is to respond to this
   question by utilizing terror management theory and a
   descriptive-analytical methodology. We suggest that the salience of
   mortality in the Al-Hawl camp has intensified the children's fear of
   in-existence. Consequently, these children are inclined to join the
   cultural worldview of ISIS, as it provides a robust safeguard to manage
   and repress this fear. The group membership can provide them with a
   sense of self-esteem, death transcendence, and immortality.},

Abstract = {Should immigrants have the same access to welfare as the native
   population? Fuelled by the populist radical right, the notion of
   restricting access to benefits to native citizens - welfare chauvinism -
   has been increasingly prominent in political debates. But can welfare
   chauvinistic attitudes be induced (or attenuated) by the negative (or
   positive) information individuals receive about immigrants? Combining
   insights from research on negativity bias and motivated reasoning, we
   argue that negative frames which emphasize fiscal costs of immigration
   are more consequential than positive frames that emphasize fiscal
   benefits, but this effect is primarily visible among those whose
   ideological priors are congruent with the negative information. Since
   more extreme attitudes are associated with increased selective
   judgement, those who occupy a more extreme ideological position should
   be particularly affected. A survey experiment in Germany supports this
   argument and shows that while a negative frame is stronger than a
   positive frame, this effect is moderated by one's ideology and is most
   evident among more extreme ideologues who hold frame-congruent
   attitudes. We also show that ideology, rather than economic
   circumstances, is a more important moderator of framing effects.},

Title = {Drivers of radicalisation? The development and role of the far-right
   youth organisation `Young Alternative' in Germany},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {Today, many far-right parties maintain youth wings, providing
   opportunities to mobilise members and future party leaders. However,
   they are often neglected in the study of the far right's organisation.
   This article explores the development of the `Young Alternative' and its
   ambivalent relationship with the `Alternative for Germany'.
   Theoretically, it argues that far-right youth wings can act as important
   drivers of radicalisation. It also tries to understand conflicts between
   far-right youth organisations and parties by discussing the interactions
   between organisational development and radicalisation. Empirically, it
   opens the `black box' of the German case by drawing on a wide range of
   primary and secondary sources, including semi-structured interviews with
   high-ranking `Young Alternative' members, (social) media communication
   and official documents of the `Young Alternative', `Alternative for
   Germany' and intelligence services. Overall, the article underlines the
   importance of far-right youth wings as part of the broader party
   organisation and offers substantial theoretical and empirical research
   perspectives.},

Abstract = {Jean Blondel's academic impact in the field of comparative governments
   was enormous, but difficult to measure. Over the past 60 years, his
   publications have fuelled the work of several generations of colleagues
   around the world. In this short essay, we first introduce his most
   influential publications. Second, we introduce the empirical findings of
   major comparative studies which stand `on the shoulders' of his research
   on governments and ministers in parliamentary democracies. Overall, we
   state that Jean Blondel's comparative research was not designed to leave
   behind an enduring theory of his own. Instead, he was more interested in
   looking for more unexpected measurable facts and merge them into
   generalizations about the future of cabinet governments and political
   leaders.},

Abstract = {In the context of an increasingly ambitious European Union (EU)
   industrial policy and the transition to electromobility, the main
   objective of the article is to uncover the interaction between the
   supranational level and domestic policies through examining the buildup
   of the electric vehicle (EV) battery value chain in illiberal Hungary
   and liberal Sweden. The study analyses these diverse cases through the
   lenses of comparative political economy. How do European industrial
   policy objectives translate into national policies under widely
   different political conditions? How do the different translations impact
   on the original objectives of EU policy? Through using a
   structured-focused comparison, the paper argues that the building of the
   EV battery industry implies the entrenchment of existing models of
   capitalism in both cases. Liberal democracy is only compatible with the
   coordinated market economy model of Sweden, while in Hungary the
   illiberal regime and the dependent market economy model reinforce one
   another in face of growing public recognition of the disadvantages of
   dependency-misallocation of resources, environmental damage, and limits
   to upgrading. EU strategic objectives are served only by the Swedish
   model, while the Hungarian model leads to deepening institutional
   cleavages within the EU and implies growing dependence on Russia and
   China.},

Abstract = {Scholars of International Organizations ( IOs) increasingly use elite
   surveys to study the preferences and decisions of policymakers. When
   designing these surveys, one central concern is low statistical power,
   because respondents are typically recruited from a small and
   inaccessible population. However, much of what we know about how to
   incentivize elites to participate in surveys is based on anecdotal
   reflections, rather than systematic evidence on which incentives work
   best. In this article, we study the efficacy of three incentives in a
   preregistered experiment with World Bank staff. These incentives were
   the chance to win an Amazon voucher, a donation made to a relevant
   charity, and a promise to provide a detailed report on the findings. We
   find that no incentive outperformed the control group, and the monetary
   incentive decreased the number of respondents on average by one-third
   compared to the control group (from around 8\% to around 5\%).},

Abstract = {Hannah Arendt's seminal yet overlooked essay ``We Refugees{''} was
   written and published in Menorah Journal in 1943 while she was still a
   stateless refugee. In this essay, Arendt vividly describes the
   impossible situation that the stateless Jewish refugees faced before and
   during Second World War. However, Arendt does not reduce it to a series
   of individual tragedies, but instead develops a highly original analysis
   of refugees as a systematic political phenomenon that exposes the
   limitations of the nation-state system and simultaneously points beyond
   it. This analysis remains more relevant than ever today, eighty years
   after its initial publication.},

Abstract = {Existing research emphasizes popular support for democracy as a key
   ingredient of democratic regime consolidation. Both formal and informal
   institutions are commonly seen as the key actors that generate the
   requisite attitudinal shift, socializing ordinary citizens to adopt
   democratic values. It is thus puzzling that existing studies of
   attitudes towards democracy in the developing world have neglected to
   consider the impact of widely prevalent traditional institutions. Not
   only do these institutions vary considerably in their own
   democraticness, they also play a prominent role in the daily lives of
   many citizens. Filling this lacuna in extant knowledge, this study links
   a continent-wide dataset of the institutional features of contemporary
   traditional institutions in Africa with over fifty thousand survey
   respondents. The results indicate that the degree of democraticness
   exhibited by traditional institutions is a robust if weak predictor of
   ordinary Africans' support for democracy.},

Abstract = {For representation to work, voters and politicians need to know each
   other's policy preferences. While we know that this may not be the case
   for voters, a growing body of research shows that politicians also
   regularly misperceive the position of the public or their party's
   electorate. However, the two strands of literature are usually not
   linked, and there is a lack of studies that analyse the mutual
   (mis)perceptions of citizens and elites. To fill this gap, this paper
   uses data from three waves of the German Longitudinal Election Study to
   compare the mutual perceptions of candidates and their party electorates
   on the left-right scale and on three policy issues. Three findings are
   noteworthy: First, candidates are only slightly more accurate than
   voters. Second, in contrast to previous studies, there is no evidence of
   a conservative bias among politicians. Third, projection plays an
   important role in both voters' and candidates' misperceptions. Where
   both groups think the others are is strongly influenced by their own
   preferences.},

Abstract = {The effects of formal constitutional amendment rules are still
   contested, yielding mixed and inconsistent findings. The key issue lies
   in overlooking the broader institutional context in which amending
   clauses are situated. This article presents a novel theoretical argument
   centered on the ``institutional embeddedness.{''} Empirically, we
   leverage a unique, most different systems design that compares Australia
   and Switzerland to assess the direct and indirect effects of formal
   amendment clauses. Both federations implement an identical
   ``direct-democratic model of constitutional change,{''} despite
   differences in size, the underlying societal structure, the federalism
   model, and form of democratic governance. Our empirical results reveal
   similar direct effects on minority protection, but differing indirect
   effects on federal dynamics differ significantly. The formal amendment
   rule sustains Switzerland's decentralized federal order, while
   contributing to pronounced centralizing trends in Australian federalism.
   These findings have vital implications for constitutional design,
   highlighting that the specific institutional context is decisive, not
   just the formal amendment rule.},

Abstract = {This article illuminates the contemporary vitality of Lenin's theory of
   ideology. Since the collapse of Soviet socialism, some have attempted to
   dismiss Lenin's theory as anti-Marxist and lacking in critical power.
   More recent studies of the Marxist theory of ideology have neglected
   Lenin entirely. Contrastingly, this article argues that Lenin's theory
   of ideology remains relevant, albeit misunderstood. First, Lenin
   highlighted the class essence of ideology with unparalleled force and
   clarity. He emphasised that every ideology serves the power of a
   definite class. Second, Lenin clarified the role of ideology as a weapon
   in the class struggle. He urged the working class to use socialist
   ideology to further its interests and overthrow capitalism. Third, Lenin
   outlined the principles for engaging in the ideological struggle. He
   instructed Marxists on how to advance their ideas and defeat bourgeois
   ones. These insights remain indispensable for communists, a hundred
   years after Lenin's death in 1924.},

Abstract = {The earliest form of modernization was capitalization, which Marx and
   Engels explained as occurring ``on pain of extinction.{''} As the
   inherent contradictions of capitalism intensified, modernization showed
   a tendency to evolve in the direction of socialization, and two
   different and opposing models emerged: the Western European capitalist
   model and the Soviet socialist model. The modernization of the old China
   was destined to fail even while it was still on the starting line. It
   was not until the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist
   Party of China, overcame the Chiang Kai-shek regime, achieved victory in
   the New Democratic Revolution, and established the People's Republic of
   China that the country's progress along the road of Chinese
   modernization really began. For historical reasons, the new China was
   obliged to develop a novel approach to its modernization process. Reform
   and opening up enabled China to seize a new opportunity, and Chinese
   modernization began to accelerate. After socialism with Chinese
   characteristics entered a new era, modernization began to take flight.
   Chinese modernization provides humanity with a new choice as it
   confronts the modernization challenge. Although Chinese modernization
   reflects China's specific national conditions and historical
   opportunities, it nevertheless has a definite world-historical
   significance.},

Abstract = {The EU sanctions have targeted Russian energy industry since 2014. Since
   February 2022, the European Union has imposed a series of unprecedented
   restrictions affecting Russian fuel trade, a highly sensitive area for
   both sides, each having a pragmatic interest hereinunder. Energy price
   cap established in 2022 became the climax of the EU' sanctions policy
   against the Russian fuel and energy complex, making it one of the
   toughest measures in the history of the EU's anti-Russian energy
   restrictions. In order to adapt to the new realities, the export
   directions of the Russian oil industry were reoriented from Europe to
   Asia. A number of domestic and foreign researchers have focused on the
   EU' sanctions policy against the Russian fuel and energy industry,
   assessing its impact on the global energy market. At the same time, some
   issues remain insufficiently studied, including the effectiveness of the
   Russian adaptation strategy, as well as the impact of this strategy on
   Russia's key trading partners. The purpose of this study is to identify
   the impact of the EU' sanctions against the Russian fuel and energy
   complex on energy trade between Russia and its main counterparts; to
   reflect the current trends in Russia's energy trade relations with
   China, India and Turkey; to assess the effectiveness of Russia's
   strategy tailored to adapt to the EU' restrictions in this area; and to
   evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy. The research shows that in
   the short term, the domestic oil industry has managed to promptly
   respond to the challenges that arose, which was possible due to
   significant discounts provided to the new partners. While Russian
   economy was trying to adapt to the current conditions in the global
   energy market, using the aforementioned strategy, key beneficiaries of
   the EU' sanctions policy were clearly identified, including India, China
   and Turkey.},

Abstract = {In the literature on participant observation, research on governments or
   international organizations plays a minor role. Few governments,
   international bodies or agencies allow for researchers in their inner
   circles, and much of the information relevant for analysis may fall
   under rules of restriction. However, if researchers get access to
   government bodies, they can gather insights on the practices of
   governance that are hard to acquire with other means. The paper
   describes a participant observation in the European department of German
   Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It discusses ways to deal with gatekeepers,
   measures of reliability and the potential dangers of identification of
   the researcher with his research object.},

Title = {Caretaker Conventions in Crisis Times: Dutch Government-Opposition
   Dynamics After the Fall of the Government},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {How does the caretaker status of a government affect party political
   dynamics in parliament during a crisis? Generally, caretaker governments
   are not mandated to introduce important policy changes. Yet major crises
   can demand decisive political action. This article aims to understand
   the consequences of the caretaker status of the Rutte III government in
   the Netherlands (after its resignation in January 2021) for
   government-opposition dynamics during the handling of the Covid-19
   pandemic. We first analyse party voting behaviour in parliament and then
   draw on a qualitative text analysis of nine critical parliamentary
   debates. Surprisingly, we find that differences between mandated and
   caretaker status have little effect on parliamentary dynamics.
   Opposition parties with coalition potential are supportive of the
   government and take on a cooperative tone; opposition parties without
   coalition potential are not supportive and take on a combative tone and
   oppose in harsher terms, yet even they barely mention caretaker status.
   As such, this case provides unique insights into the functioning of
   caretaker conventions during crises which offer opportunities for new
   theorising in the undertheorised field of caretaker cabinets and
   parliaments.},

Abstract = {This research critically analyses the current socio-political and
   economic context of mass surveillance in order to reconstruct the keys
   and conditions of possibility that guide its development in a fair and
   responsible sense. The study, on the one hand, warns of the dangers and
   disruptive impacts underlying the mass social surveillance currently
   exercised by states and large technological corporations. On the other,
   it suggests that this mass social surveillance is giving rise to
   despotic practices that pervert democratic processes, reduce spaces of
   freedom and increase the inequality gap. Finally, it offers guidelines
   for confronting mass social surveillance: the promotion of a strong
   civil society that acts as a counter-power to the state and big tech.},

Journal = {POLITIX},

Number = {145},
Abstract = {- In recent years, violence against the forces of law and order has
   given rise to crosscutting strategies of scandalization, particularly
   during large-scale social movements involving clashes between police and
   demonstrators. Based on a survey conducted at the TGI de Paris and a
   study of sixty-seven cases involving offences against public officials
   (contempt, rebellion, violence), this article looks at the demonstrative
   use of force against the police and gendarmerie during the Gilets jaunes
   movement. It analyzes both the conditions of ``anti-cop{''} acts during
   the various Paris acts, their (de)legitimization and repression, as well
   as, by focusing on all the repressive stages- arrest, police custody,
   trial - on the interactions between Gilets jaunes and law enforcement
   officers during each of them.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a critical normative analysis of charter schools. It
   categorizes and evaluates the main arguments in defense of charters:
   market competition, improved learning outcomes, autonomy and innovation,
   and their potential to function as ``counterpublics.{''} After finding
   each argument wanting, the paper proposes a tripartite critique of
   charters based on (i) their deleterious effects on social solidarity,
   (ii) the procedural injustice involved in access, and (iii) their
   substantively unjust outcomes. We show how charter schools undermine
   social and political solidarity by fragmenting communities into more
   homogenous subsets. Although they purport to be equally open to all,
   charters covertly rely on morally arbitrary characteristics such as
   class, race, and disability in admissions. Finally, we argue that they
   unfairly reduce the quality of education for some students, thus
   resulting in substantively unjust outcomes.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the contribution of Rev. Robert Wallace to the
   development of an << enlightened public sphere >> in XVIIIth century
   Scotland and highlights his reflections on the relationship between
   population growth, on the one hand, and social and moral improvement, on
   the other. Since Wallace strongly criticized the extremes of luxury and
   indigence, which were typical of that society, and envisioned a perfect
   government but was also a supporter of Hanoverian establishment and
   commercial society, the author argues that it is impossible to apply the
   classical categories of << Ideology >> and << Utopia >> to Wallace's
   writings one-sidedly, or to place his theory in an << ideological grid
   >>. The paper concentrates on Wallace's originality and stresses the
   interaction between Christian theology, moral view of society, rational
   approach to reality and open-mindedness which characterizes his
   thinking.},

Abstract = {How should parties that oppose gender quotas react to their adoption and
   to the new environment of political competition? Should they signal to
   voters that they are willing to compromise and accommodate the new
   status quo, or should they dismiss the growing importance of gender in
   politics instead? In this article, we unmask the indirect effects of
   gender quotas by arguing that electoral threats act as a political
   competition mechanism changing elites' strategic calculations about
   women's inclusiveness. Using legislative debates in Portugal, we show
   that parties that voted against the gender quota reform but face an
   electoral threat adopt women-friendly stances in order to signal to
   voters that they are responsive to changes in the salience of gender. In
   contrast, parties that opposed the gender quota reform but do not face
   an electoral threat engage in strategies that are dismissive of these
   new policies.},

Abstract = {This work discusses around the process of territorializing of
   Hidroituango, the largest hydroelectric project that is being built in
   Colombia. It considers some of the socio-environmental effects produced
   by it, as well as the dynamics and the interactions it has had with the
   internal armed conflict in the Northwest of Antioquia, the place where
   this megaproject has been localized. For this, it analyzes, from an
   ethnographical approach, some discourses and practices mobilized by the
   Company promoting this megaproject and by some State institutions to
   justify the implementation of this, despite the failures, risks and
   conflicts that are configured in the context of planning and execution
   of the works. More than energy and progress, Hidroituango has produced
   some ``collateral{''} effects that have contributed, on the one hand, to
   expanding and strengthening the institutional power of the State in that
   territory and, on the other hand, to strengthening the socioeconomic
   structures that dominate the territory, the armed conflict and the
   extractivist model.},

Abstract = {The management of the Greek crisis has given rise to numerous critical
   assessments, which have identified it as the endorsement of a
   technocratic and austerity-driven power with little regard for adherence
   to European rules. This article, based on a sociological analysis of the
   normative work of staff within a European Commission service known as
   the `task force for Greece', demonstrates the value of going beyond such
   a perspective to understand the impact of exceptional circumstances on
   the actors at the centre of crisis policies. The Greek crisis poses a
   challenge to these staff members, as it complicates intervention and its
   alignment with European rules. What emerges is a surprisingly critical
   discourse aimed at restoring the role of the ``European bureaucrat{''},
   even at the risk of undermining institutional coherence during the
   crisis. The tensions revealed by the research are understood through the
   intertwined context, the actors and their interpretations during their
   activities. This outlines a different narrative of the management of the
   Greek crisis, which has often been perceived as apolitical at its core.},

Abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations are commonly used to test the performance of
   estimators and models from rival methods, under a range of
   data-generating processes. This tool improves our understanding of the
   relative merits of rival methods in different contexts, such as varying
   sample sizes and violations of assumptions. When used, it is common to
   report the bias or the root mean squared error of the different methods.
   It is far less common to report the standard deviation, overconfidence,
   coverage probability, or power. Each of these six performance statistics
   provides important, and often differing, information regarding a
   method's performance. Here, we present a structured way to think about
   Monte Carlo performance statistics. In replications of three prominent
   papers, we demonstrate the utility of our approach and provide new
   substantive results about the performance of rival methods.},

Pages = {131+},
Abstract = {News of Aleksei Naval'nyi's death sent a shock wave through Russian
   society. However, opinion polls show that most people have been
   insulating themselves from this shock. It is the same pattern that can
   be observed amid all terrible news stories, such as those about the
   Russian Army's crimes against Ukrainian civilians. The news is
   disturbing, and the reaction is aggressive denial. Anyone who accepts
   the news as true must stand up the regime. However, many people are not
   willing to do this. Therefore, they do not want to believe in the
   obvious and readily accept interpretations that relieve them of the
   obligation to act. Only at a moment when the population can no longer
   avoid confrontation with the regime could the power emanating from the
   man Aleksei Naval'nyi and his fight against the tyrant drive the people
   to overthrow the regime.},

   hardly be any talk of independent public expertise in Russia. Some of

Abstract = {Electronic voting is one of several tools that have the potential to
   reduce the cost of voting for citizens and thus motivate them to vote.
   However, the results of previous research have shown that this effect is
   not achieved in every case. Our research examines the potential
   consequences of the introduction of e-voting in the Czech Republic,
   where the introduction of this tool is the topic of public discussion.
   More specifically, we examine whether the introduction of this tool has
   the potential to increase voter turnout and for which groups of citizens
   the potential is highest. For this purpose, we use data from a survey
   conducted on a representative sample of respondents. To test the
   hypotheses, we employ binary and multinomial logistic regression models.
   The results of the analysis show that the introduction of electronic
   voting, compared to other tools facilitating voting, has the highest
   potential to increase voter turnout in the Czech Republic. The increase
   in voter turnout is particularly noticeable among groups of citizens
   that usually do not participate in voting.},

   power relations in the Portuguese parliament},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Who the Members of Portuguese Parliament are? What do the
   representatives of the people represent? Why is it that for some to be
   in parliament was something wanted and prepared and for others something
   ``unpredictable and unexpected{''}? Why do some MPs feel ``at home{''}
   and others consider themselves like ``fish out of water{''}? Based on an
   ethnography of the Portuguese Parliament, this article discusses how and
   why political representation is largely dominated by educated men, from
   large urban areas and part of multiple political environments. Then, it
   is argued that the individual agency of the MPs can only be understood
   in the context of their insertion in a deeply hierarchical world.
   Finally, it is argued that different social and cultural backgrounds
   enhance or inhibit access, permanence and adaptation to the gears of the
   political/parliamentary field. A field that is structured from the
   possession of the political capital, that is, a form of composite
   capital, simultaneously cultural, social and symbolic, unequally
   distributed, which stablished a set of boundaries between who is inside
   and who is outside, between who can represent and who should be
   represented.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of the main aspects of the

   the country aspect and in the functional aspects, such as the state, the
   private sector, public-private partnership). The impact of the space
   activities on the development of other sectors of the economy is
   emphasized. Particular emphasis of this conducted research is on the
   American space activities. The spiral-evolutionary approach to the
   development of space activities is discussed. The most important key
   space technologies both in terms of the development of space-based
   facilities and systems and the space production complex and also the
   main approaches of the leading space countries to the development of the
   space weapons are determined by the authors. In total identified aspects
   underline the necessity for the extension of the discussion platforms

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the materialistic interpretation of
   Jean-Jacques Rousseau's political theology by Louis Althusser. This
   approach is particularly interesting because it treats materialism in a
   completely different plane from that of Marxism. Emphasizing the
   contingency of the emergence of the civil state, Althusser places
   Rousseau within the general tradition of modern materialism, the
   distinctive features of which are anti-theocentrism and
   anti-historicism. At the same time, Althusser emphasizes that Rousseau
   had a radically different view on the origins of human society from the
   ideas of other Enlightenment philosophers. This allowed Althusser to
   separate Rousseauism from the traditional political philosophy of the
   18th century. For this reason, the parallel interpretation of Rousseau's
   views in the sphere of political theology does not in any way contradict
   the materialist interpretation of his teachings. In this article, the
   author scrutinizes the history of different approaches to the
   understanding of matter and materiality, and compares alternative
   perspectives on Rousseau's political theory. The article shows, that
   Althusser's interpretation was openly deconstructivist, even though it
   was based on the subjects brought up by Rousseau himself. In the final
   part, the author also touches upon the concept of multiple temporality,
   which, being closely connected with materialism, has a pure Rousseau's
   origin.},

Title = {From Idealism to Political Communication Strategy: A Comparative
   Analysis of the Professionalization of Left-Wing Presidential Campaigns
   in Colombia (2006-2022)},
Journal = {DESAFIOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {With the election of Gustavo Petro to the presidency of Colombia, as
   representative of the so-called ``left{''} in the country, concern
   arises about the campaign strategies and tactics that could have
   contributed to the victory of such a project at the polls. For this
   reason, a comparative analysis of the most important ``leftist{''}
   political campaigns in Colombia in the 21st century is conducted, with
   the objective of perceiving the impact of the accelerated transformation
   process in the dynamics of communication and political relations in the
   formulation of a highly personalized and successful leftist electoral
   project, such as the Historical Pact in 2022.
   The four most significant campaigns of the Colombian left between 2006
   and 2022 were selected, being all contenders in the second electoral
   round {[}Carlos Gaviria (2006), Antanas Mockus (2010), Gustavo Petro
   (2018 and 2022)]. The evolution in professionalization is measured by
   means of the Index of Professionalization of Electoral Campaigns (inpro)
   (Restrepo-Echavarria et al., 2018), based on the. analysis of various
   components in two essential dimensions: organizational and
   communicative.
   In this study, it is evident that the left in Colombia has a progressive
   process of professionalization of how they conduct electoral campaigns.
   This transformation is evidenced mainly by the arrival of external
   collaborators, consultants and advisors who bring a different
   perspective to the partizan scenario, commonly related to the left in
   the country; and the digital transformation of communication strategies.
   It is evident that the left has evolved its dogmatic way of campaigning
   for a more modern, qualified and competitive process.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the association between emotions and electoral
   participation. It asks which encourages or inhibits the vote and whether
   or not they play the same role in different age groups. To address these
   questions, we use the results of a survey conducted in Chile during the
   2017 elections. It is argued, first, that among the general population,
   fear and optimism play a role in the decision of the vote. Second, in
   young people's case, these emotions play an even more significant role.
   Third, anger is not related to the decision to vote.},

Abstract = {The Republic of T \& uuml;rkiye was one hundred years old by October 29,
   2023. This also means 100 years of the Turkish Republic's foreign policy
   and diplomacy, 100 years of engagement with Europe, and an ambiguous
   relationship between the EU and T \& uuml;rkiye. In this paper, we argue
   that the relationship has always been characterised by competing forces
   of alignment and distancing from both sides. Thus, instead of glorifying
   EU-T \& uuml;rkiye relations or deploring their demise, in this study,
   we want to point to the ambiguities of the relationship around five
   themes in which both cooperation, harmonisation and conflict, divergence
   occur the most: identity, integration, economy, society, and security.
   We believe that these are both the main forces behind and affected by T
   \& uuml;rkiye's 100-year-old Europeanization process. In conclusion, we
   attempt to clarify that specific historical junctures and circumstances
   have benefitted different sides in their struggles against each other,
   and the result is a complex web of entanglements and ruptures that
   defies reductionist characterisations as ``pro-{''} or
   ``anti-European{''} in the past and today as well. Yet, we explain that
   T \& uuml;rkiye and Europe are entangled too deeply to completely break
   apart and too diverse to be attached to a clearly delineated joint
   future.},

Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {This article scrutinises the impact of corporatism within the framework
   of informal fascist networks between Germany, Austria, and Italy before
   the consolidation of the National Socialist and Austrofascist regimes in
   1933/34. In particular, it examines the intertwining of previous local
   traditions of socio-political organicism across the German NSDAP and
   Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten, , the Austrian Heimwehren and Italian
   fascism as a convergence process. It shows that corporatism represented
   a key notion orienting the relational agency of right-wing groups
   towards a common, transnationally circulated vanishing point and thus
   ultimately worked as a projection towards a mutually shared, even if
   only vaguely specified, horizon. Resonating with the core fascist
   expectation of a nation-state eventually purged from enemies and
   minorities through violence, this produced a synchronisation of
   expectations among movements and enabled their mutual networking beyond
   the tensions of the time, real-political conflicts, and overall
   dispositional incommensurability.},

   circulations in Poland and the Czech Republic (2000-2023)},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2024},
Number = {146},
Abstract = {This article looks at exits from politics and public administration into
   lobbying and highlights how they are shaped by the structural
   constraints and opportunities created by the specific characteristics of
   the state and the market. It is based on a corpus of 79 career paths of
   Polish and Czech commercial lobbyists with previous public sector
   experience. These bring us to highlight two specific structural
   constraints for the lobbyists' trajectories - the key role played by
   party patronage practices in relation to the state apparatus and
   state-controlled companies, and the strong level of internationalisation
   of national economies, making multinational firms the dominant clients
   on the lobbying market. Additionaly, the high percentage of individuals
   who remain in lobbying over the period observed (2000-2023) suggests
   that lobbying can be seen not only as a possible opening for former
   public officials, but also more particularly as a way of staying ``close
   to politics{''} from which it is relatively difficult to escape, given
   the structural factors that make returns both difficult and
   unattractive.},

Abstract = {There is no easy explanation for why some people believe in conspiracy
   theories. Susceptibility to conspiracy theories can be associated with a
   range of various factors in which both psychological and situational
   components play a significant role. In this article, I aim to provide a
   review of potential psychological and situational factors that fuel
   conspiracy theorising, focusing primarily on examples relating to
   politics. Moreover, I aim to analyse the effects of conspiracy theories
   on society and politics. At the beginning, I will define the key terms
   used in psychology research. Then, I will discuss psychological factors.
   I will review current research on predispositions that drive people to
   believe conspiracy theories. These may comprise psychological motives
   (epistemic, existential, and social), cognitive factors (e.g. intuitive
   thinking style), personality traits (e.g. maladaptive traits), or
   worldviews (e.g. authoritarian worldviews). In the next section, I aim
   to illuminate situational factors. Large-scale and threatening events
   may drive people to seek explanations in the wrong places, specifically,
   in conspiracies. A notable example is the COVID-19 pandemic when the
   popularity of conspiracy theories greatly increased. Overall, a
   combination of specific predispositions and situations may significantly
   contribute to higher levels of conspiracy beliefs, which, consequently,
   severely impact society.},

Abstract = {Demand-side studies of populism, adapting a citizen perspective, have
   grown exponentially during the last decade as a result of a growing
   political and academic concern over the potential effects of populism on
   the political system. Nevertheless, how populist attitudes at the
   citizen level are related to actual proposals for system-change is a
   surprisingly neglected research topic. One such proposal concerns the
   future of multiple-mandate-holding (MMH), i.e. the simultaneous exercise
   of at least two directly elected political functions, a controversial
   practice in many parts of Europe. By utilizing cross-sectional panel
   data gathered in Finland in 2022-2023, a country characterized by
   extensive MMH among Members of Parliament, this study seeks to explore
   whether and how populist attitudes are related to the idea of
   representational pluralism in the political system, defined as the level
   of diversity among directly elected political representatives active
   within the political system. Using statistical analyses, we confirm our
   hypothesis that stronger populist attitudes are clearly associated with
   weaker support for MMH in general and stronger support for limiting the
   scope of MMH specifically. Our findings contribute to the
   theory-building of demand-side populism by showing that populist
   attitudes are also associated with the idea of representational
   pluralism.},

Abstract = {Advocates of radical realist theories of legitimacy propose that
   political legitimation narratives are often void where they show signs
   of motivated reasoning. In a recent critique of the method, example
   cases have been put forward in which an analysis and critique of flawed
   justification narratives seems urgently called for, and yet motivated
   reasoning is absent. This, critics suggest, should deflate the
   prominence of motivated reasoning within the radical realism. I argue
   here that those cases are misconstrued. Motivated reasoning can either
   be easily identified therein, or the cases are irrelevant to begin with.
   The issue with realism's motivated reasoning connection is another: the
   explanatory direction of fit between epistemic circularity and motivated
   reasoning. The former explains the normative salience of the latter.
   Hence, I hope this intervention clarifies a misunderstood and
   underexplored aspect of contemporary radical realist theory and adds to
   the contextualisation of the psychology of motivated reasoning within
   normative social theory more broadly.},

Abstract = {Since Key and Allport, scholars have argued that racial context affects
   political behavior, with some finding out-group contact increases
   intergroup hostility and others showing the opposite. We argue that
   Americans exist in multiple racial contexts simultaneously that may
   overlap or conflict, helping to explain past discord. Using novel data,
   we document in-group embeddedness among the four largest U.S.
   ethnoracial groups for three kinds of racial context: geographic,
   social, and psychological. These three contexts are only weakly
   correlated, we find, with social ties exhibiting distinctly high rates
   of in-group segregation. We next examine the relationship between racial
   contexts and political attitudes, showing that individuals who are
   highly embedded across contexts express notably different views than
   those who experience cross-cutting pressures. Our results underscore a
   need for greater care and specificity when examining the relationship
   between ``racial context{''} and political phenomena.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the possible electoral advantages and
   disadvantages of a unique party that competes in two simultaneous
   elections with respect to those obtained when it competes as two
   different parties. I assume that a unified party has a larger strategy
   set but it is forced to choose the same policy in both elections. I
   analyze different scenarios depending on the features of the electorates
   and of the party configuration that it faces: the same party or two
   different parties. In all cases, I show that a unified party can only
   fare better than two independent parties when the two electorates are
   similar enough. In this case, the party may obtain the vote of the
   moderates in both elections. If the electorates are aligned with the
   opponent the gains from unification are more likely in more polarized
   electorates. Otherwise, the losses from unification increase with the
   intensity of the electoral competition.},

Abstract = {Political science research has assessed how racial attitudes influence
   political behavior. However, less is known about the political effects
   of anti-Asian views, even as anti-Asian sentiment resurfaced during the
   pandemic. We theorize that the linkage of COVID-19 to Asian Americans by
   political elites activated anti-Asian animosity and shaped vote choice
   during the 2020 election. Using cross-sectional over time and panel data
   from the American National Election Studies, we find that holding more
   anti-Asian attitudes was not associated with Republican vote choice
   between 2008-2016, including when Donald Trump first ran. However,
   anti-Asian views became strongly related to voting for Trump in 2020.
   Further panel analysis demonstrates evidence that anti-Asian views
   measured prior in 2016 increased the likelihood of vote switching to the
   Republican Party in 2020. We conclude by discussing the potentially
   persisting political effects of anti-Asian attitudes in an environment
   continuously characterized by anti-Asian hate and especially during
   future election cycles that may feature increasingly diverse candidates
   of Asian heritage, running for elective office across various levels of
   government-including for the presidency. This study contributes to
   research on how and when racial attitudes influence political behavior
   and suggests, again, the centrality of race and ethnicity in American
   Politics.},

Abstract = {This study builds on the existing literature by considering the extent
   to which minority legislators offer different forms of constituency
   outreach during times of emergency. This case study of state legislator
   constituent outreach during the COVID-19 pandemic uses an analysis of
   Facebook posts in 2020 to track how state legislators provided outreach
   and communicated resources to their constituents during a public health
   crisis. We ask, in times of emergency, do women and minority legislators
   offer unique attention toward the needs of those constituencies that
   they descriptively represent, or do urgent issues push these legislators
   to focus more broadly on general concerns expressed by their entire
   district? We argue that legislators' social media activity during the
   COVID-19 pandemic offers an important measure of their practice of
   constituency outreach due to the nation's reliance on virtual
   communication during this period. This study finds there to be important
   variation by partisanship, but within party, we find important
   differences depending on both the race and gender of the legislator.
   Democratic women of all races were those legislators most actively
   providing information and outreach related to COVID-19 to their
   constituents in 2020.},

Abstract = {Conflicts about climate action have persisted in Germany despite other
   crises. Research on this conflict is still emerging and requires
   constant updates as the situation continues to evolve. Currently, there
   is a strong focus on the climate movement and individual protest groups.
   This paper shifts the analytical approach by applying conflict theory to
   the quarrels over climate action since the rise of Fridays for Future.
   Analyzing a rich corpus of documents, the paper provides three key
   contributions: First, it reconstructs the conflict dynamics over time
   across multiple groups, linking conflict developments to mechanisms of
   escalation and de-escalation (e.g., organization and exhaustion of
   solidarity, alliances, and resources). Second, the paper highlights
   counterescalation dynamics with crucial impact on conflict development.
   Finally, accounting for counter- and de-escalation dynamics helps to
   explain the strategic shifts of groups such as Fridays for Future and
   the Last Generation. Overall, this paper advocates for a broader
   approach to the struggles about climate action that is grounded in
   conflict theory. It explores its potential using an extensive document
   review and outlines new directions for future research. Notably,
   conflict theory also provides a framework that can bridge research on
   protests and climate obstruction.},

Abstract = {Many international institutions are looking into the danger presented by
   false information, particularly for democracies. An abundant body of
   scientific literature has been addressing this problem for just under a
   decade. This article sets out, first, to review the state of the art on
   this subject, highlighting the specific features of the contemporary
   cognitive market. While rumours, conspiracy theories and so on are the
   sea serpents of the human imagination, our contemporary world is giving
   these forms of credulity renewed vitality. The aim is also to shed light
   on the situation today by taking an analytical approach to some of the
   most important mechanisms involved (superspreaders, data voids, ``mille
   feuilles{''} arguments that are resistant to contradiction, etc.).},

Abstract = {This study investigates Beijing's use of educational initiatives as a
   tool for soft power in Pakistan. It explores how these initiatives
   influence various stakeholders within Pakistan. The research employs a
   descriptive analysis approach. It examines the mechanisms China utilizes
   through its educational system to build relationships with Pakistan,
   promote Chinese culture, and shape Pakistani perceptions of China.
   Beijing leverages its educational system through four key mechanisms to
   exert soft power in Pakistan. Confucius Institutes offer Chinese
   language courses and cultural events, fostering direct engagement with
   Chinese culture. University partnerships facilitate knowledge exchange
   and joint research collaboration between Chinese and Pakistani
   universities. Scholarship programs attract Pakistani students to study
   in China, providing them with language skills, cultural understanding,
   and potential career opportunities. Finally, the internationalization of
   Chinese universities, offering English-taught programs, makes them more
   accessible to Pakistani students. The impact of these initiatives varies
   across stakeholder groups. Students and academics directly benefit by
   gaining language skills, cultural understanding, and potential career
   opportunities. However, concerns exist about ideological influence,
   academic freedom, and brain drain. Broader Pakistani society experiences
   indirect exposure through media, interactions with graduates, and
   changing perceptions of China.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes political issues based on structural topic modelling
   (STM) for the party documents and news articles from the Chinese
   Communist Party (CCP)'s archive on 19 National Congresses of the CCP and
   82 plenary sessions of the central committee. This article discusses how
   the CCP has emphasised development issues as common goals to mobilise
   different social groups since 1989, when critical social cleavages
   emerged in China. Evidence from text mining analysis shows that the CCP
   emphasised the issues of economic development and consistent development
   as social conflicts and inequality increased after economic reform took
   place. The focus on economic development and consistent development was
   a political strategy to elicit extensive support from powerful groups
   within society and the mass public. This finding helps to understand how
   political parties in non-democratic countries utilise political issues
   to strengthen their regimes.},

Title = {The Integrative Critique of Democracy: Three Key Strands of
   Antidemocratic Thought in the History of Ideas and Their Recurrence in
   Contemporary Antipopulism},
Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 25},
Abstract = {This article shows that contemporary antipopulism utilises
   antidemocratic figures of thought that date back to ancient Greece.
   First, three complementary strategies of defence against demands for
   equal political and social participation are identified on the basis of
   three stages in the history of ideas (Greek antiquity, the American
   Revolution at the end of the eighteenth century, and early liberalism in
   the nineteenth century). First, devaluation: Here, groups of people are
   described as irrational and easily seduced, which is why they are
   excluded from political decision-making processes. Second,
   institutionalisation: If the complete exclusion of the many is not
   possible, then the establishment of an institutional filter system
   offers the possibility of restricting their political scope. Third,
   without the other two strategies disappearing, since the 19th century
   there has been an increasing demand to educate the social classes, who
   are not yet considered politically capable, to become good citizens.
   Subsequently, the return of these three antidemocratic figures of
   thought is demonstrated using exemplary contributions to the populism
   debate. The article concludes with the diagnosis that contemporary
   antipopulism is faced with the challenge of labelling as democratic
   those institutions that are supposed to limit democracy. This is why the
   widespread invocation of democracy in the fight against ``populism{''}
   seems so helpless.
   Der Artikel zeigt, dass der gegenw \& auml;rtige Antipopulismus
   antidemokratische Denkfiguren bem \& uuml;ht, die bis in die griechische
   Antike zur \& uuml;ckreichen. Zun \& auml;chst werden anhand von drei
   ideengeschichtlichen Etappen (griechische Antike, die Amerikanische
   Revolution am Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts und der Fr \& uuml;hliberalismus
   im 19. Jahrhundert) drei sich erg \& auml;nzende Strategien der Abwehr
   von Forderungen nach gleicher politischer und sozialer Teilhabe
   herausgearbeitet: Erstens Abwertung: Hier werden Personengruppen als
   irrational und leicht verf \& uuml;hrbar beschrieben, weswegen sie aus
   den politischen Entscheidungsprozessen ausgeschlossen geh \& ouml;ren.
   Zweitens Institutionalisierung: Wenn der v \& ouml;llige Ausschluss der
   Vielen nicht m \& ouml;glich ist, dann bietet die Einrichtung eines
   institutionellen Filtersystems die M \& ouml;glichkeit, deren
   politischen Gestaltungsspielraum einzuschr \& auml;nken. Hinzu tritt
   drittens, ohne dass die beiden anderen Strategien verschwinden, seit dem
   19. Jahrhundert verst \& auml;rkt die Forderung, die als noch nicht
   politikf \& auml;hig betrachteten sozialen Klassen zu guten B \&
   uuml;rgern zu erziehen. Anschlie ss end wird anhand von exemplarischen
   Beitr \& auml;gen der Populismusdiskussion die Wiederkehr dieser drei
   antidemokratischen Denkfiguren aufgezeigt. Der Artikel schlie ss t mit
   der Diagnose, dass der gegenw \& auml;rtige Antipopulismus vor der
   Herausforderung steht, als demokratisch jene Institutionen
   auszuzeichnen, die die Demokratie begrenzen sollen. Daher wirkt die
   verbreitete Beschw \& ouml;rung der Demokratie im Kampf gegen den
   ,,Populismus{''} so hilflos.},

   representative democracies?},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 22},
Abstract = {Populist parties' key claims include the transformation of
   representative democracies by favouring a direct relationship with
   political institutions. Nonetheless, populist proposals regarding
   democracy reforms remain a rather understudied topic beyond direct
   democracy. This paper aims to extend the existing scholarship on the
   relation between populism and democratic representation by addressing
   two main angles: the lack of an extensive inquiry of populist democratic
   agendas, and their impact on political representation. Therefore, it
   explores if populist parties' democratic agendas conceive an alternative
   understanding of representative democracy. Through a quantitative and
   qualitative content analysis of party manifestos by inclusionary,
   exclusionary, and non-populist parties in five Southern European
   countries, this study assesses the institutions covered by proposals of
   institutional change, and the representative dimensions and direction
   there implied. Results mainly suggest that host ideologies, rather than
   populism, have a major role in shaping democracy agendas. Whereas
   inclusionary populism stresses inclusive reforms and participatory
   politics, the exclusionary counterparts put forward a noteworthy number
   of exclusive reforms, namely regarding the representative function.
   These differences are mostly visible for descriptive and symbolic
   dimensions of representation, as they pertain to the construction of the
   people. Overall, this study enables new paths of research on the topic
   of populist representation.},

Abstract = {Anti-Roma racism remains a persistent concern in numerous European
   countries. Despite sustained efforts by both the European Union and
   national governments over the past two decades to promote Roma
   inclusion, the effectiveness of these integration policies has largely
   been perceived as inadequate. This has been evident in the widespread
   exclusion experienced by Roma communities. Focusing on the Czech
   Republic, this article moves from examining state policies to the
   actions of civil society. In this context, the article explores the role
   played by Czech civil society organizations (CSOs) in both challenging
   and perpetuating racialized Roma exclusion. Building on Bourdieu's
   concept of social habitus, this article expands it to a racialized
   social habitus framework. Through online interviews with CSOs and
   ethnographic fieldwork in four Czech cities, it explores the complex
   interplay between integration policies, civil society, and the
   racialized exclusion of the Czech Roma. The article illuminates how
   these organizations simultaneously contest and reinforce racialized
   perceptions of the Roma, thereby enriching scholarly dialogue on the
   complex dynamics of race and racism within civil society.},

Abstract = {This paper inquires whether political comedy and satire, in which it is
   customary to articulate the centrality of ordinary citizens and disdain
   for elites, are bound to portray politicians and politics via populist
   lenses. It compares the joking about politics in Ukraine on two
   television shows in 2019-2020, soon after Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian
   turned politician, came to the presidency with populist narratives in
   2019. The results demonstrate that whereas one of the shows, Vecherniy
   Kvartal, used populist framing of politics rather extensively, the
   other, called, bizarrely, \#@)(sic)?\$0, not only avoided it but even
   made populist rhetoric itself the target of jokes.},

Abstract = {The geopolitical situation of a state located on a frontier between two
   (or more) cultures affects both its foreign policy and its warfare
   ideologies. Frontier ideologies are inextricably linked to this
   particular geopolitical situation, and one of the most prominent among
   these is that of the Bastion of Christianity. It should be noted,
   however, that this is not the only representative example. This article
   presents a typology of frontier ideologies, which can be divided into
   four categories: ideology of unidirectional mediation of culture;
   bastion ideology; the finger between the doorjamb and the door ideology;
   and ideology of bidirectional mediation of culture. This typology is
   supported by Hungarian ideas from the nineteenth and twentieth
   centuries, which represent the heyday of Hungarian frontier ideologies.},

Title = {Creative Research Methods and Civilian Agency in Civil Wars: Crafting
   the Past Through Memory Workshops in Colombia},
Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 14},
Abstract = {This article explores the potentialities of memory workshops for
   studying civilian agency in violent settings. Drawing from field
   research with campesino communities in Colombia, it provides a
   description of the workshops' implementation process, including creative
   tools such as memory web creation, collective drawing of timelines and
   exploration of emotional biographies. Through these activities,
   campesinos reflected on the embodied and discursive relations within
   their communities, evoking experiences and practices of wartime. The
   article highlights the limitations of conventional research methods and
   proposes memory workshops as a methodological alternative that
   foregrounds the co-production of data, facilitating the emergence of
   localised knowledge and self-authorship.},

Abstract = {The development of multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP)
   has allowed scholars to more accurately estimate subnational public
   opinion using national polls. However, MRP generally recovers less
   accurate estimates from polls whose respondents are selected using
   cluster sampling - also called area-probability sampling. This is in
   part because cluster-sampled polls rely on a complex form of random
   sampling focused on national representativeness that may result in small
   or unrepresentative subsamples in subnational geographies. This has
   limited MRP's usefulness in subnational opinion estimation in several
   contexts, including historical polls in the US, where cluster-sampling
   was common into the 1980s, and large academic studies in many countries
   today. In this paper, I propose two approaches to improve estimation
   from MRP with cluster-sampled polls. The first is pooling data from
   multiple surveys to produce a larger sample of clusters. The second is
   clustered MRP (CMRP), which extends MRP by modeling opinion using the
   geographic information included in a survey's cluster-sampling
   procedure. Using simulations, I show that both methods improve upon
   traditional MRP, and I validate them using historical polls in the US},

Title = {The Roots of Direct Democracy in the United States: South Dakota's 1898
   Referendum Creating the First Statewide Initiative Process},

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {We investigate voter preferences for changes in voting rules, focusing
   specifically on the creation of citizen-initiative processes that were
   originally adopted in South Dakota in 1898 and eventually enacted by
   half of the states. Various claims have been advanced about why the
   process was adopted and who supported or opposed it, but without
   presenting evidence from referenda where voters approved the creation of
   the process. We test these claims by examining county-level election
   returns from South Dakota's 1898 referendum that created the first
   statewide initiative process in the United States. We find that support
   for the initiative process was generally higher among groups that are
   disadvantaged in various ways by existing representative institutions
   and perceive advantages in creating direct democratic institutions
   capable of bypassing representative processes. These findings stand in
   contrast to the notion that the adoption of constitutional rules will be
   relatively free from calculations rooted in self-interest and perceived
   advantage from the rules changes.},

Abstract = {In the 2019 and 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party
   (BJP) enjoyed a significant appeal among the youth. However, in 2024,
   the stakes completely changed and the party ended up losing significant
   seats. This article explores political participation of youth in 2024
   Lok Sabha elections and focuses on the central question: Is the youth
   still attracted to the BJP? Using data from National Election Study
   (NES), the article discusses how the youth have voted and the reasons
   behind their voting choice. The findings reveal that despite extensive
   efforts of political parties in carving out a youth constituency, none
   were truly successful.},

Abstract = {Across the world, many citizens go to the polls amidst armed threats
   from both state and non-state actors. How do militarized elections
   affect citizens' willingness to accept restrictions on democratic
   rights? We argue that when forming opinions about appropriate limits to
   state powers, citizens navigate competing threats from state and
   non-state actors. The display of state coercive force should make
   citizens more protective of civil and political rights. Yet, if it
   occurs in the context of threat posed by non-state actors, citizens may
   become more likely to accept that rights are restricted. We embed a
   vignette experiment with a selective information prime in a 2019
   post-election survey of 1,080 Indian citizens across two states affected
   by armed insurgency. We find that being primed on a heavy state-military
   presence makes citizens more reluctant to accept restrictions on civil
   and political rights, but the effect is only found among politically
   marginalized groups. In the presence of violent non-state threats,
   however, citizens become more likely to support policies that curtail
   democratic rights.},

Abstract = {This study explores the relationship between the local roots of
   Westminster MPs and parliamentary party discipline, a central principle
   of the British system of responsible party government. While recently
   the local base of MPs has attracted increasing academic attention, only
   little effort has been put into investigating how this might influence
   the political behaviour of parliamentarians. In order to do so, this
   study utilizes a comprehensive database on the local base of British
   parliamentarians, which includes data on all Westminster MPs from 2010
   to 2021, supplemented with information on parliamentary dissent.
   Contrary to theoretical assumptions and existing international studies,
   localness is shown to have no positive influence on MPs propensity for
   parliamentary rebellion. This suggests that the increasing recruitment
   of local candidates does not challenge the traditional functionality of
   the responsible party system of government, yet nor should localness be
   seen as a panacea for the perceived representational deficits of British
   democracy.},

Abstract = {While we know that the far right thrives when migration is salient in
   public agendas, what happens when this issue is no longer under the
   spotlight? Building on 25 face-to-face interviews with activists
   mobilized against migration during COVID-19 in Italy, this article
   explores far-right framing of migration as a non-salient issue. We find
   that far-right groups indeed reframe their messages vis-\& agrave;-vis a
   less favourable political setting; yet they are also able to seize fresh
   opportunities to reactivate opposition to migration, notably via
   prognostic frames delivering ostensibly depoliticized views that hijack
   solidarity principles and emphasize pragmatic and technocratic
   approaches to border control and migration management. In uncovering the
   discursive strategies used by far-right actors to bolster their

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 11},
Abstract = {Lobbying expenditures are widely used as a proxy variable for measuring
   lobbying activity. However, the validity of this approach has rarely
   been examined and existing justifications do not account for
   heterogeneity in expenditure formats across types of lobbyists. I
   address the question using unique lobbying disclosure data from
   Wisconsin, where lobbying organizations report both expenditures on
   lobbying-related activities and lobbyists' hours worked. Strong overall
   correlations between changes in expenditures and hours worked within
   organization-lobbyist dyads indicate that lobbying expenditures can
   serve as a reasonable proxy. However, caution is warranted due to
   substantial heterogeneity, with contract lobbyist relationships
   exhibiting weaker correlations than in-house relationships. I conclude
   by providing suggestions to improve empirical analyses that rely on
   lobbying expenditures.},

Abstract = {This paper explores how legislators use social media, specifically
   investigating whether their posts reflect the concerns expressed by
   their legislative party peers in an anonymous survey. Utilizing data
   from Twitter (now X), we compare legislators' social media posts with
   their responses in a survey of legislators in Latin America. We propose
   a novel and scalable method for analyzing political communications,
   employing OpenAI for topic identification in statements and BERTopic
   analysis to identify clusters of political communication. This approach
   enables a thorough and detailed examination of these topics over time
   and across political parties. Applying our method to statements made by
   members of the Chilean Congress, we observe a general alignment between
   the preferences stated in surveys by elites and the prominence of these
   issues on Twitter. This result validates social media platforms
   (particularly Twitter) as a tool for predicting politicians'
   preferences. Our methodological approach offers a scalable tool for
   analyzing political rhetoric over time.},

Abstract = {Citizen political knowledge is conventionally measured with survey
   questions developed for use in the industrialized wealthy democracies.
   In this paper, we argue that certain characteristics of political
   institutions and party systems that are relatively common in
   unconsolidated democracies and mixed regimes are likely to constrain the
   acquisition of political knowledge as traditionally measured. Using data
   from Latin America, Africa, and the countries included in the
   Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, we examine the relationship
   between contextual factors and average levels of political knowledge
   across countries, measured both through civics knowledge and the
   ideological placement of political parties. We provide evidence
   consistent with the idea that citizens have fewer opportunities and are
   less motivated to acquire political knowledge in contexts where
   political institutions and actors frequently change and where young and
   nonprogrammatic parties are the norm.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the importance of an often-ignored vigilante
   group; the Catholic Ex-Servicemen's Association. 1969 saw the
   mobilisation of Irish Catholics in Northern Ireland who had served in
   the British Army as part of ad-hoc vigilante groups defending
   nationalist areas. These groups protected Catholic neighbourhoods from
   loyalist assault and from incursion by the security forces who were
   increasingly seen as a hostile force. In 1971, this ex-service personnel
   formed an all-Ireland organisation: the Catholic Ex-Servicemen's
   Association. At their peak in the early 1970s, they claimed a membership
   of 17,000 and an ability to mobilise a further 20,000 in a `doomsday
   scenario'. CESA's prominence waned by the late 1970s. CESA has received
   very little academic attention. This article aims to ameliorate that,
   supplementing the scant secondary literature with newspaper and archival
   material to account for the emergence of the Catholic Ex-Servicemen's
   Association, analysing their importance in shaping the trajectory of the
   Troubles and saying something of the complexities of identity in the
   nationalist community in the early period of the conflict.},

Abstract = {The study of party systems tends to focus on individual parties and
   overlooks factions and other sub-party units. Although the impact of the
   district magnitude on the number of electoral parties is well
   established, the electoral rules incentives on party subunits have been
   overlooked. Using electoral results at the district level, we assess the
   effect of the district magnitude on the effective number of parties and
   effective number of factions competing in elections and with legislative
   seats in Colombia (1958-1990). By focusing on parties and factions, we
   produce empirical evidence from 444 datapoints to support the claim made
   elsewhere that roots of multi-partism were present throughout the period
   studied, including under the National Front (1958-1970), where only two
   parties were permitted. The district magnitude impacts the number of
   parties and the number of party subunits, but its effect is stronger on
   the former. When the National Front came to an end and electoral rules
   were modified in the 1970s, there was an increase in party factionalism
   and new parties in the years before multiparty system rules were
   enshrined in the 1991 constitution.},

Abstract = {This essay analyzes two Marxist interpretations of James Harrington. The
   first, developed by Achille Loria at the end of the nineteenth century,
   uses Harrington to force Marxism into a mechanistic and determinist
   dimension that imagines the relationship between economics and politics
   reductively. The second, by Antonio Negri, removes the ontological
   dimension of Harrington's thought because it is incompatible with a
   polemical and conflictual conception of politics. Our thesis is that
   both interpretations of Harrington are wrong, because they are partial
   and overlook or ignore some key aspects of Harrington's theory. Yet
   their comparison, along with the awareness of their partiality, sheds
   light on a central element of historical materialism, namely the
   importance (and difficulty) of an articulation between critique of
   political economy and critique of politics.},

Abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that cross-partisan conversation can reduce
   affective polarization. Yet, this evidence comes from experiments that
   dampen the contentious features of political environments like
   elections. We expected that cross-partisan conversation will be less
   effective at reducing affective polarization for partisans who
   experience partisan group threat from an election loss. We test our
   theory using a preregistered experiment in which Democrats and
   Republicans chatted via text online. Participants discussed the 2020
   presidential election immediately following Biden's inauguration, a
   contentious context that we show differentially amplified feelings of
   group threat among Republicans. However, for both sides, cross-partisan
   conversations reduced out-party animosity for at least three days,
   reduced social polarization, but did not increase perceptions of
   election integrity. Our results suggest that cross-partisan conversation
   can effectively reduce affective polarization among both Republicans and
   Democrats even in contentious contexts that amplify group threat.},

Abstract = {The nexus between democracy and peace in Africa is examined by applying
   data to 42 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries between 2008 and 2020.
   The study used panel regression techniques that include Ordinary Least
   Squares, the Tobit regression to account for the limited range of the
   dependent variable, and the System Generalized Method of Moments to
   account for endogeneity bias. Using seven indicators of democracy, which
   include electoral democracy, liberal democracy, participatory democracy,
   deliberative democracy, egalitarian democracy, a total democracy index
   derived from principal component analysis, and the Polity2 score, and
   using the global peace index as a proxy for peace, our findings show
   that all the indicators of democracy, irrespective of the model, have a
   positive and significant influence on peace in SSA. The result has
   underscored the importance of advancing democratic practices and values
   to promote sustainable peace and stability in the region.},

Title = {Informed Inattention: How Political Connections Undermine Judicial
   Responsiveness in China},
Journal = {CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 17},
Abstract = {The integration of information and communication technology (ICT) has
   significantly transformed the interaction between governments and
   citizens. While past studies have focused on how citizen appeals affect
   responses from public servants, less attention has been paid to the role
   of officials' attributes in shaping government responsiveness. This
   paper explores how political connections influence responsiveness within
   the Chinese court system. Using a formalized principal-agent model, we
   argue that connected local judges, who have better information about
   central authority's task priorities, tend to allocate less effort to
   routine tasks of lower importance. To test this hypothesis, we
   constructed a novel database containing biographical information of
   provincial chief judges in China and their online interactions with
   citizens from 2014 to 2020. Our empirical analysis shows that
   politically connected judges are less responsive in routine tasks of
   responding to citizens. This study offers new insights into how internal
   political dynamics impact the responsiveness of government institutions.},

Abstract = {Centralized agenda control is a feature of many parliaments, with
   important consequences for the conduct and outcomes of legislative
   politics. Much previous work has thus sought to understand the emergence
   of centralized agenda-setting rules. We extend this literature by
   studying the ``Balfour reforms{''}, which centralized agenda control in
   the early twentieth century UK House of Commons. Our aim is to probe a
   conventional claim in the existing literature: that the opposition
   supported these reforms. This is a counter-intuitive claim, which rests
   on relatively little direct evidence. We analyze historical roll-call
   data from 1902 to assess how far the opposition supported agenda
   centralization. We complement this analysis by examining attempted
   amendments and speech contributions to parliamentary debates. Contrary
   to the standard view, we find that the primary opposition party
   consistently resisted these reforms. This evidence of controversy rather
   than consensus revises our understanding of a key milestone in the
   development of the Westminster parliament, and contributes to the wider
   literature on the choice of agenda-setting procedures.},

Abstract = {How does partisan identity impact rural identity? While prior research
   has found associations between rural identity and partisanship, few
   studies experimentally validate this relationship. Using two separate
   experiments-a partisan prime and a conjoint-we explore the relationship
   between rural identity and partisan identity to show that when partisan
   identity is in conflict with rural identity, the partisan identity
   dominates. Our findings indicate that the relationship between partisan
   identity and rural identity is asymmetrical for Democrats and
   Republicans. For Republicans, rural identity often reinforces their
   partisan identity. However, for Democrats, rural identity is subordinate
   to their partisan identity. That is, Democrats weaken their rural
   identity when primed to think about their partisan identity and
   Democrats' partisan identity supersedes the expression of a rural
   identity when rating hypothetical candidates. Overall, when rural and
   small town Democrats are thinking in a partisan mindset, their rural
   identity becomes less salient.},

Title = {The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on support for the SNP and
   Scottish independence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 10},
Abstract = {The retrospective model of voting holds that parties are elected based
   on their perceived competence in government and punished for
   incompetence. This theory is complicated in contexts of multilevel
   governance as it requires attributing responsibility to a particular
   party in a particular level of government. This paper tests the extent
   to which this model explains public opinion in a multilevel context
   (Scotland) on a high-stakes valence issue (the coronavirus pandemic).
   Using British Election Study Internet Panel data from 2019 to 2021, it
   assesses how the public responded to the perceived competence of the
   Scottish Government and British Government. The results find that for
   each Government those voters who rated their handling of the pandemic
   more highly increased their liking of the governing party and its
   leader. Further, those voters who thought a Government had performed
   well were more likely to switch towards supporting the party in power,
   but this depended on how much they previously liked that party.
   Similarly, increases in support for Scottish independence from the UK
   came from those voters who not only judged the Scottish Government to
   have handled the pandemic well, but also previously liked the SNP prior
   to the pandemic.},

   from the 2021 elections to the Welsh Senedd},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 6},
Abstract = {An oft-cited benefit of candidate-based elections is that voters can
   hold individual candidates accountable for their issue stances. However,
   voters may not always be aware of candidates' policy positions, a
   concern which becomes especially salient in regional elections. Using
   mass online survey data and a fixed effects approach, we investigate the
   extent to which voters were influenced by the policy positions of
   individual candidates when voting in the 2021 elections to the Welsh
   Senedd. We find that candidates' policy positions did matter, but that
   this effect was small, limited to issues voters deemed to be
   particularly important, and only emerges among voters with high
   political interest. That said, our findings also suggest that the
   influence of candidates' policy positions on voting behaviour was not
   substantially smaller when compared to national elections in the UK and
   elsewhere. We discuss options for improving voter responsiveness to
   candidates' issue stances.},

Abstract = {Recent literature has highlighted that to understand insurgent
   behaviour, it is integral to adopt a gendered perspective. However, this
   scholarship tends to integrate a gendered perspective by emphasising
   gender roles, gendered narratives, women's experiences, or prevalence of
   sexual and gender-based violence, respectively. We argue that to
   understand how gender relations are constructed in insurgencies, it is
   helpful to develop a synthetical framework that takes stock of these
   gendered dynamics, including the relationships between them. By bringing
   together feminist and gender-focused literature from across terrorism,
   insurgency, and civil war studies we demonstrate that insurgencies can
   be understood as gendered organisations at the three levels of culture,
   structure, and agency. We posit that the insurgent ``gendered
   organisations{''} framework can further nuance our conceptualisation of
   how gender is constructed and reproduced, at different levels in an
   insurgency, in complex and sometimes contradictory ways. Through an
   analysis of existing empirical works spanning across three broad
   ideologies - jihadism, ethno-nationalism, and Marxism - we demonstrate
   that each ideological programme exerts a clear influence on the gendered
   organisation of an insurgency at these three levels.},

Abstract = {The ``Prevent Duty{''} requires that UK public sector bodies have a
   statutory responsibility to stop individuals from supporting terrorism
   or becoming terrorists, including within education settings. Despite
   existing research that highlights the experiences of Prevent for Muslim
   students, the topic of Muslim women students appears to have been
   largely neglected. This paper addresses the lack of empirical research
   that focuses on Muslim women in the post-16 education sector and the
   impact of the Prevent Duty. I add to existing research on Prevent within
   education by focusing upon Muslim women's experiences concerning the
   strategy, by utilising Critical Race Feminism's counter stories. The
   research draws on counter stories deriving from focus group and
   interview data to demonstrate the lived experiences of Prevent for young
   Muslim women in further and higher education within England. Within the
   empirical data collected, three themes were identified: 1)
   self-censoring; 2) the ``visible Other{''}; and 3) the
   responsibilisation of Muslim women. The findings of this research
   demonstrate that there is a gendered impact of the Prevent strategy
   within post-16 education and it occurs in different avenues.
   Accordingly, I call for a concerted effort to draw further attention to
   the future of Prevent, particularly within the education sector.},

Abstract = {The Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) sector assumes increasing the
   number of women involved in peace negotiations drives better outcomes
   for local women. However, empirical support for this assumption is
   inconsistent. This article tests how power alters the relationship
   between women's formal (Track 1) involvement in peace negotiations and
   the inclusion of women-specific provisions in peace agreements. Using an
   original dataset comprised of 2,299 Track 1 delegates involved in 116
   comprehensive peace agreements finalized between 1990 and 2021, I find
   women's involvement in peace negotiations is positively correlated to
   comprehensive agreements containing provisions for women. However, this
   correlation is dependent on women holding positions of power-simply
   having women in the room is insufficient. This article offers a novel
   quantitative approach to WPS studies, provides nuance to theories
   linking descriptive and substantive representation, and casts doubt on
   the longstanding assumption that increasing women's involvement
   inherently enhances gender equality.},

Abstract = {This Article looks back on the defeat of the Aboriginal and Torres
   considers a number of influences to help explain the failure of the
   referendum. The continuing disengagement or decline in voter
   participation in this referendum is of significant concern, especially
   in the Northern Territory. The stakes were high that this referendum
   campaign would not create a rift within the Australian community but
   would become a vehicle for greater understanding and relationship
   between Australia's Indigenous and nonIndigenous communities. This
   article highlights the approximately 1.8 million enrolled voters who
   failed to attend a polling booth at the Voice to Parliament referendum.
   Could these voters have made a difference in the outcome? If not, could
   augmenting the current referendum machinery with deliberative democratic
   processes provide the engagement tools needed to reverse this trend of
   declining participation?},

Abstract = {Drawing on Tocqueville's insights into the novel and distinct forms of
   political life in the democratic age, this article defends an account of
   America as a modern commercial empire. Despite Tocqueville's warning
   that in general nothing is so pernicious to human happiness as great
   empires, we argue that he saw something worthy of respect in the
   Anglo-American ambition to expand humanity's dominion over nature and to
   establish an empire of the industrious and rational. We compare
   Tocqueville's qualified endorsement of France's colonial project in
   Algeria with his assessment of the promise and perils of the empire of
   commerce in America, identifying how each form of empire affects the
   prospects for sustainable self-government. Though modern commercial
   empire threatens to engender excessive materialism, Tocqueville's
   analysis indicates that it is more compatible with liberalism than
   traditional forms of empire.},

Abstract = {This forum article presents a new dataset on roll call votes in the
   committees of the European Parliament in the 2014 to 2019 legislative
   term. Data on roll call votes in the plenary has greatly informed
   research on the functioning of the European Parliament, broader
   legislative politics and European Union decision-making. Responding to
   transparency concerns about legislative decisions increasingly taken at
   committee level, a change of the European Parliament's Rules of
   Procedure introduced mandatory roll calls in committees from 2014. The
   article explains the context of the rule change, the data collection
   effort, and the data as such. A discussion of conflict across
   committees, party group cohesion and participation in roll call votes
   illustrates potential applications of the data.},

Title = {Towards an ecological transition from below: insights from a workers'
   mobilization in the automotive sector},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 29},
Abstract = {This article aims to shed light on the processes and conditions that
   enable workers to maintain employment stability and wage security while
   reorganizing production to effectively address the ongoing climate
   crisis. By thoroughly analysing a case of workers' mobilization within
   the automotive sector at the GKN plant in Campi Bisenzio
   (Florence-Italy), we underline the conditions under which workers may
   support a transformative ecological transition. Their campaign has
   rapidly become emblematic of a national movement that integrates social
   and environmental concerns. Through qualitative analysis of social media
   content, self-produced documents, and in-depth interviews, we illustrate
   how these workers, by stepping into a gap left by both the state and the
   market, have advocated for a credible and radical bottom-up transition
   plan. This plan challenges the power imbalances within the production
   system and positions workers and the local community as key stakeholders
   in plant management, as well as guardians of the local territory and its
   environment. Their organizational model and identity, strategic
   alliances, and the specific territorial context in which they operate
   are conducive to this endeavour.},

Abstract = {How do legislators, many of whom hold policy positions that are not
   consistently conservative or progressive, position themselves on the
   left-right ideological scale? Analyzing data from the Parliamentary
   Elites in Latin America (PELA) survey, this paper leverages combinations
   of moral and economic policy positions to determine the
   weight-germaneness-of each policy on that scale. Using bi- and
   multivariate models on a database of about 5000 legislators, we confirm
   the importance of economics but also find that moral issues can be
   germane to the left-right placement of many of the region's legislators.
   The relative germaneness of the policies is inconsistent for legislators
   of the left and right. The left is more heterogeneous because moral
   policies are less germane to their identification. However, many
   centrists hold conservative economic and moral views, blurring the tie
   between policy and ideological positions. We confirm that contextual
   factors can sharpen the issue-to-ideology relationship.},

Abstract = {This article examines the concepts of citizenship and exclusion in the
   writings of the nineteenth-century Chinese American figure Wong Chin Foo
   (1847-1898) and situates his works within the context of Chinese
   Exclusion in the United States. Against a backdrop of intensifying
   racial violence and legal and social exclusion, Wong repudiated racial
   stereotypes that were used to justify Chinese exclusion. He argued that
   the Chinese were culturally and morally distinctive but assimilable to
   American society. Central to his argumentative strategy was his critical
   reappropriation of the idea of the Chinese as unassimilable
   ``heathens.{''} However, his conception of citizenship as conditional on
   ``character and fitness{''} exposed the exclusionary nature of American
   citizenship and reinscribed its boundaries along racial and class lines.
   In treating Wong as a political thinker in his own right, this essay
   makes three contributions. First, it offers a historical elucidation of
   what Gordon Chang has called ``the politics of the excluded.{''} Wong's
   works show how central categories of politics and political
   thinking-like citizenship-are reconfigured by the very people those
   categories were designed to exclude. Second, this essay offers an
   alternative interpretive framework for reading texts within Asian
   American political thought and intellectual history. Finally, this essay
   forms a theoretical intervention by showing how Wong discloses the
   peculiarities of Asian American positionality in debates about racial
   citizenship in America.},

Abstract = {Even though they both held the same office, Donald Trump and Joe Biden
   could not have presented themselves more differently. Biden presented
   himself as the restorer of tradition after Trump was the disruptor. In
   this research note, we examine seven sets of speeches that hold constant
   either the timing or the setting to see if their rhetoric contrasted as
   much as the way they presented themselves. We find that the words and
   emotions that they invoked were not nearly as systematically distinct
   from each other as we expected. We argue that this result demonstrates
   that the power of the presidency as an institution is sufficiently
   constraining that even the most unorthodox candidate's rhetoric mirrors
   that of a traditionalist. When we do uncover some distinctions between
   them, those that exist are, for the most part, consistent with our
   expectations.},

Abstract = {This paper interrogates how the racial logic of instrumentalisation -
   the intended exploitation of racialised peoples for intellectual capital
   - shapes the field of Critical Terrorism Studies (CTS). I argue that the
   problem of instrumentalisation highlights CTS's limitations to advance
   anti-racism because of how it standardises non-racist (rather than
   anti-racist) logic and practices in academia. Adopting a postcolonial
   perspective inspired by Frantz Fanon and Robbie Shilliam, this paper
   discusses the problem of CTS furthering the structural issue that is
   counterterrorism policymaking spaces privileging ``white faces{''}
   rather than engaging knowledge production practices that are more
   cognisant of the relational attributes of ontology. This distinction of
   ``rather than{''} is argued to be an important emphasis in how this
   distinction challenges the quality of criticality within CTS if CTS
   cannot meet its core commitments in the context of anti-racism. The aim
   of pursuing this evaluation is not to replace white faces with non-white
   representations by way of calling for diversity in the CTS
   professoriate. The focus of this critique of CTS is instead to explain
   why CTS scholars should re-examine their philosophical commitments and
   knowledge relations to evaluate how they can better demonstrate
   intellectual generosity and allyship in service to anti-racist
   intellectual traditions.},

Abstract = {Victimization is often associated with increased political
   participation, and victims are influential political actors in many
   countries around the world. Yet for victims, activism is costly: they
   tell and re-tell painful stories, face searing criticism, and work to
   exhaustion-all at one of the worst moments of their lives. So why do
   they do it? Based on ethnographic research with Families for Safe
   Streets, a group of victims-turned-activists in New York City, this
   article advances a new explanation for victims' participation in
   politics. I propose that for some victims, meaning-making is an
   in-process benefit of activism. My inductive research suggests three
   ways victims find meaning in politics. First, through their activism,
   victims can re-conceptualize the losses and harms they have suffered as
   policy problems, rather than random, inexplicable events. Victims may
   also seek to help others by changing laws to prevent similar tragedies
   from recurring, and some victims see their activism as a way of
   fulfilling important obligations to their communities, their families,
   and their deceased relatives.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the constitutional legitimacy of the measures
   enacted by Tthe Iraqi government to prevent the COVID-19 spreading,
   which restricted the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Iraqi
   Constitution 2005. even though the epidemic is a health emergency, the
   House of Representatives has not declared an emergency state, as the
   Cabinet resorted to taking preventive measurement to curb the crisis
   spreading, that restricted constitutional freedoms and rights even
   though the Iraqi constitution explicitly states that the rights and
   freedoms cannot be restricted except by law or based on it, however,
   this restriction was governed by administrative orders issued by a
   committee establish by council of ministers under Diwani Order 55 of
   2020, headed by the minister of health, which amended then to become
   headed by the prime minister, for that purpose we have followed the
   analytical approach to assess the decisions taken by this committee
   through interpreting constitutional and legal texts and examining many
   of their restrictive resolutions imposed for demonstrating its
   legitimacy or illegitimacy and through this analysis we concluded that
   the majority of its decision on rights and freedoms under the pretext to
   preventspread of Covid-19 unconstitution even though the epidemi was
   serious it cannot be justified for violating democratic values.},

   {[}Anonymous], 86 This over-simplified historical narrative of progression of confidence in PrEP (as measured by percentage) is present in the most recently-released U.S. clinical guidelines for PrEP. See, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: US Public Health Service, ``Preexposure Prophylaxis for the Prevention of HIV Infection in the United States - 2017 Update - A Clinical Practice Guideline{''} (Atlanta, GA: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), March 2018), especially 19, 53. The knowledge-base about the progression of knowledge about PrEP efficacy would benefit from more rigorous analysis by social scientists who study biomedicine and health. Additionally, the reasons why biomedical HIV prevention strategies seem to require a much higher level of efficacy than barrier protection methods in order to secure the endorsement of major actors in public health is an area where HIV scholars ought to dedicate additional attention. For an exploration of this topic, see, Kane Race, ``Reluctant Objects: Sexual Pleasure as a Problem for Biomedical HIV Prevention,{''} GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies 22, no. 1 (2016): 1-31, https://doi.org/10.1215/10642684-3315217., DOI DOI 10.21518/M2023-018.

Abstract = {Tom Nairn once suggested that making a new nation always entails making
   a new class. This observation by one of Scotland's most influential
   intellectuals from the long era of campaigning for a Scottish parliament
   is used here as the starting point for investigating how the social
   basis of views about Scotland's governing system has evolved since the
   1990s. The consolidation of support for the system that was established
   in 1999, and the growth of support for independence since then, may be
   understood, in part, as a consequence of the growth of a new social
   class, composed predominantly of graduates from the massively expanded
   system of higher education who are employed in the burgeoning service
   sector of the economy. The support for independence has been especially
   marked among those graduates who work in that part of the service sector
   that consists of public services such as education, health and
   government itself.},

Abstract = {Our study examines whether citizens punish political misbehavior by
   estimating the impact of disciplinary sanctions on the re-election of
   political parties in Colombian mayoral elections. Results reveal that
   disciplinary sanctions have no effect on the re-election of
   paramilitary-linked parties. However, they can have a significant
   negative impact on the re-election of traditional and minority parties.
   The lack of punishment suggests that organizations manipulate voters
   through persuasion mechanisms, aligned with the Schumpeterian view of
   political competition.

   Examining how responsive communication influences legitimacy perceptions},

Abstract = {This article explores how citizens' legitimacy perceptions are affected
   when decision makers deviate from the recommendations of a deliberative
   mini-public (DMP), and what can be done to mitigate negative
   consequences. The results of a preregistered vignette experiment in
   Belgium (N = 2659) support our two main expectations. First, citizens'
   legitimacy perceptions decrease when politicians do not follow the
   outcome of a DMP. Second, when politicians communicate responsively
   about this - meaning that they show respect for the recommendations and
   publicly justify why they deviated from them - legitimacy perceptions
   substantially increase, generally reaching the level of those cases
   where recommendations are followed. Diving deeper into this result also
   shows that for this effect to occur, citizens must find the provided
   reasoning valid and acceptable. Finally, the results hold among both
   policy winners and policy losers. These findings have implications for
   the literature on democratic innovations, empirical legitimacy, and
   political representation, but also for policymakers striving to combine
   arrangements of public participation that go beyond triviality, with
   political responsibility for the whole, and sustained mechanisms for
   accountability.},

Abstract = {When Nepal promulgated a new constitution in 2015, discourse around the
   `New Nepal', post-monarchical rule, was powerful; the new constitution
   was perceived as a landmark text to provide a clear vision for New
   Nepal's overall development. The poor state of Dalits' human rights and
   educational realities were widely cited as critical issues requiring
   attention and expedited intervention during the constitution-writing
   process. Almost a decade later, however, no outstanding progress is
   evident regarding the overall development of the historically
   marginalized Dalits. This paper aims to interrogate the perpetuation of
   the dominant ideology, as the basis for the marginalization of people
   lacking power, in the new constitution's fundamental and educational
   provisions by exploring its marginalizing semantic elements. We selected
   these semantic elements or linguistic categories through reading the new
   constitution. Our analyses expect to unfold the link between Dalits'
   poor state of human rights and educational experiences and the
   provisions of the new constitution. This study helps expose the roots of
   inequality, exclusion, and social injustice by appraising policies of
   public interest in situations where human rights violations, illiteracy,
   and poverty have distressed the lives of marginalized people, as well as
   encouraging research on the problems faced by extremely vulnerable
   population like Dalits, who are not only marginalized in their place of
   birth but also in the diaspora.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to identify the factors underlying the
   success of peace negotiations in Africa, with particular emphasis on the
   role of UN peacekeepers. We analyze African Peace Processes (APP) data
   over the period 1989-2019 using the binary logistic model. Our results
   show that the deployment of UN peacekeepers is associated with the
   success of mediation efforts, both in intra-state and non-state
   conflicts. On the other hand, the presence of peacekeepers is
   detrimental to the success of bilateral negotiations. These results thus
   highlight that the ambiguity surrounding the effectiveness of UN forces
   in the peaceful management of conflicts depends on the presence or
   absence of a mediator. Consequently, political decision-makers should
   combine the deployment of peacekeeping forces with mediation initiatives
   to achieve peaceful conflict management. On the other hand, this should
   not be envisaged within the framework of bilateral negotiations, at the
   risk of producing opposite effects.},

Abstract = {China's eradication of absolute poverty represents a major contribution
   to world development, a contribution that could not have been achieved
   without applying a strategy of targeted poverty alleviation.
   Implementing this strategy has in turn depended fundamentally on the
   functioning of the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
   First, the system has been oriented towards comprehensively addressing
   and systematically solving the problem of absolute poverty through
   unifying short-term relief with long-term empowerment. Second, the logic
   underlying the system construction has involved a coupling and
   interaction between the government and the market. The system of
   mobilizing resources nationwide for poverty alleviation has featured a
   ``trinity{''} in which the central government has provided an
   overarching guide while paired assistance has occurred between developed
   and less developed areas, and while local governments have played a
   dynamic role. This involves having subjective and endogenous forces from
   poverty alleviation to poverty eradication, providing comprehensive
   assistance in fields from systemic change to intervention at the micro
   level, and enabling integrated operations in areas from targeting to
   policy implementation and empowerment. Third, the effectiveness of the
   system is reflected in the high quality, long-term effectiveness and
   endogenous motivation that have been features of China's effort to
   overcome poverty.},

Abstract = {The aim of this work is to delve into the two main theoretical sources
   behind the radical right's << obsession >> with the << cultural battle
   >>: the Nouvelle Droite and the American Alt-Right. Thus, this article
   will examine their metapolitical proposal focusing on their
   conceptualization of hegemony, departing from Antonio Gramsci's original
   idea and aligning more closely with the populist approaches of Ernesto
   Laclau. The focus will be on overcoming a decadent modernity and
   reviving Western civilization through an ethnodifferentialist proposal.
   The article is divided into two parts. In the first part, we will
   analyze the metapolitical proposal of the Nouvelle Droite, which
   introduces the concept coined by Alain de Benoist. After examining its
   core ideas, we will proceed to break down its ideological-cultural
   strategy contrasted with the ideas of Gramsci and Laclau. In the second
   part, we will analyze the Alt-Right, whose strategy directly draws from
   the metapolitical approaches of the Nouvelle Droite, albeit with a
   tactic focused on the Internet and social networks.},

Abstract = {After the pandemic and the onset of wars, the economic crisis
   underscores the importance of integrating society into the relationship
   between state and market to enhance government action. To overcome this
   crisis, it is essential to understand that the effectiveness of public
   policies relies on shared governance, starting from the creation of a
   culture of knowledge and solution sharing with society, the private
   sector, the third sector, academia, international organizations, and
   evolved and developed countries. This paper not only reviews the
   literature on corruption, popular participation, knowledge management,
   and cultural intelligence but also presents the New Public Service (NPS)
   model as a foundation for a qualified popular participation model to
   reduce corruption, which several researchers attribute to the current
   New Public Management (NPM) model. This model illustrates that shared
   knowledge and solutions with society and other countries have the
   potential to transform national culture, thereby reducing corruption and
   enhancing the effectiveness of public administration projects.},

Title = {Understanding the effect of term limits on voter turnout: Evidence from
   a quasi-experiment in Costa Rica based on a registered report},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Imposing term limits on elected officials is expected to increase
   turnout due to enhanced competition by one theoretical perspective,
   while another predicts depressed turnout as a result of clientelist
   turnout buying. These puzzling contradictory predictions are examined by
   a quasi-experiment (using a difference-in-differences approach) based on
   a 2022 reform which introduced term limits for Costa Rican mayors that
   were applied for the first time in the 2024 municipal election. Over one
   half of mayors suddenly faced retroactive term limits, while the
   remaining ones were eligible for reelection. This analysis was
   pre-registered following the 2022 reform but before the 2024 election,
   that is, at a time when treatment assignment already occurred but the
   post-treatment outcomes were not known and the analysis could still not
   be performed. The analysis could only be completed after the February
   2024 election. The results suggest that the adoption of term limits
   reinvigorated electoral competition but that its participatory gains
   were only modest, fostering turnout only in the largest cities. The
   analysis contributes by advancing the-still uncommon-practice of
   pre-registering observational research after the treatment assignment
   but prior to the release of the data (and even prior to the processes
   that produce that data).},

Title = {Afghanistan: The Economic Impact of Armed Conflict},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Number = {48},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This study examines the economic impact of armed conflict in
   Afghanistan. During the armed conflict between 1978 and 2021, the
   country received \$88 billion in official development assistance (ODA)
   and over \$136 billion in war-induced USAID funding. We found that the
   one-year Afghan armed conflict, with an average of 17,661 battle-related
   deaths, increases the GDP per capita by at least 1.9\%. Comparatively, a
   one-year US-led war relative to a USSR-led war increases the GDP per
   capita by at least 5.7\%; in contrast, a one-year civil war reduces it
   by 4.1\%. In addition, our cost estimation suggests that between 2002
   and 2021, at least \$40.9 +/- 5\% billion (45.9\%) of the Afghan state
   budget is spent on war-related and war-affected institutions. This is
   equal to 1,062\% of Afghanistan's total GDP in 2002 and 280\% in 2021.
   Moreover, this study will be helpful in understanding the implications
   of the Sustainable Development Goals and achieving specific targets such
   as Goal 8 (economic growth) and Goal 16 (peace and inclusive societies)
   in Afghanistan.},

Abstract = {A recurring obstacle to scholarly inquiry into conflict is the lack of
   access to reliable data. The advent of innovative technologies and
   methods for remote data collection may alleviate this issue. This
   article introduces open-source satellite-gathered fire data as a tool
   for detecting unreported conflict events, and for improving the
   reliability of pre-existing conflict event data. To demonstrate this
   potential, I compare the distribution of fire data to conflict events in
   five oblasts in southeastern Ukraine and find that fire data can be a
   spatiotemporally accurate proxy for conventional warfare involving heavy
   use of artillery and aerial bombing. Examining the 2020-2022 Tigray War,
   I also demonstrate that fire data can be a powerful tool for uncovering
   unreported targeted violence involving arson in low information
   environments. Finally, I argue that fire data opens the door for new
   research by allowing conflict scholars to address data gaps and data
   reliability issues.},

   managerialization of law in Brazil},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {Investigating the case of Brazilian public policy for reverse logistics
   (RL), the article intends to draw attention to the process of
   ``managerialization of law{''} through which the initial objectives of
   public policies are often distorted to fit the interests of companies or
   groups of companies. We analyzed the 12 production chains where LR is,
   in different degrees, regulated in the country. We evaluated the
   performance of the Brazilian federal legislative power to make the
   polluter-pays principle applicable and the institutionalization of RL
   systems via agreements and contracts signed with industrial sectors.
   Using the content analysis methodology, we analyzed law and regulation
   during development process and the LR contractualization instruments.
   Results: only 17\% of the analyzed documents define specific penalties
   for non-compliance; public-private contracting has proven to be
   ineffective; and a high rate of managerialization of the law is
   identified in order to avoid RL costs. Conclusion: the federal
   legislative process is characterized by the management of legal
   intentions by companies. The management of the law is an effective form,
   not much studied in Brazil, of political action by companies that, in
   the case of reverse logistics, manage to dilute the polluter-pays
   principle and direct environmental responsibilities to consumption
   activities, at the same time that contractualization allows the spread
   of responsibilities to other organizations in the production chain,
   including those that do not generate waste.},

Abstract = {Autocrats use preventive repression to deter opposition mobilization. I
   show that repression can be more intense and arbitrary under constraints
   that prevent the use of other policy tools, like patronage. Building on
   a conceptual distinction between targeted repression (against regime
   opponents) and indiscriminate repression (against civilians broadly), my
   framework demonstrates that autocrats may benefit from using both types
   of repression together to deter opposition to the regime. Targeted and
   indiscriminate repression have distinct effects on civilians' incentives
   to support an opposition. Targeted repression reduces benefits of
   challenging the regime, activating civilians' security concerns.
   Indiscriminate repression affects individuals' material well-being,
   leading to a net improvement in economic opportunities. These
   participation and material well-being mechanisms make targeted and
   indiscriminate repression jointly optimal for the autocrat. Further,
   targeted and indiscriminate repression may be complements, meaning the
   regime prevents the emergence of opposition groups most effectively by
   employing more of both types of repression simultaneously.},

   longitudinal perspective},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {90},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This research note investigates the development of turnout gaps in
   Europe, associated with four key determinants of electoral
   participation: income, education, age, and gender. We extend previous
   research on unequal turnout in two main ways. First, we include longer
   time series. Relying on the World Political Cleavages and Inequality
   Database, we are able to estimate turnout gaps in 240 elections from 20
   countries, from the 1950s to 2020. Second, we suggest a method to
   compare education and income levels across elections, which is a
   prerequisite for estimating changes over time in their effects. We find
   clear evidence of growing turnout gaps linked with education, income,
   and age, while the gender gap has become close to null. Our findings are
   robust across a number of alternative model specifications, and they are
   consistent with results, for the more recent period, based on the
   European Social Survey.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {167-189},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Previous literature has demonstrated electoral advantages for candidates
   with backgrounds in the communities they represent, even amidst the
   trends of partisan polarization and the nationalization of elections.
   Here, we consider voter preferences for local candidates using a broader
   range of methods, jurisdictions, time periods, and populations than has
   previously been utilized. Our results leverage a survey experiment
   presenting respondents with pairs of fictional open-seat U.S. Senate
   candidates with varying degrees of local backgrounds. Voters
   consistently responded more favorably to locally-rooted candidates
   across different states. We also present novel evidence that local
   candidate effects are due largely to voters crossing party lines, and
   that the parties are asymmetrical in their responses to localism and
   carpetbagging, with Democrats benefitting from local ties more than
   Republicans. Observational data on real-life Senate candidates from 1960
   to 2020 largely mirror our main experimental findings. Together, these
   findings demonstrate that local connections matter in more nuanced ways
   than have been previously considered.},

Abstract = {Supplemental instruction (SI) has become ubiquitous on college campuses.
   Originally developed at the University of Missouri, Kansas City, SI has
   become a popular pedagogical tool. While ample evidence exists that SI
   is particularly helpful regarding courses in the natural sciences, less
   is known about the helpfulness of SI in political science. In this
   paper, we seek to understand the effect of supplemental instruction in a
   core political science course, Introduction to American Government. We
   examine this effect at a community college that is designated as a
   Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). Using data from 332 students, across
   two semesters, we found that participation in SI sessions improved
   student success outcomes across several indicators, most notably course
   retention and success. More importantly, we find this improvement among
   Latinx students as well when further analyzed by race and ethnicity.
   This is highly relevant given the demographics of the college.},

Abstract = {``Cancel culture{''} has become a prominent phrase in US political
   commentary, with supporters and opponents relying on different
   value-based arguments to express their views. At the same time, these
   camps often fall along predictable partisan political lines. What, then,
   are the real motivations for promoting and opposing behaviors sometimes
   labeled as ``canceling{''} in contemporary American politics? We explore
   this question through survey data from Pew in 2020 and two original
   survey experiments, conducted on the 2021 CES and a 2023 online sample.
   We examine how Americans define the term ``cancel culture,{''} to what
   extent cancel culture is linked to both a range of core democratic
   values, and the role of partisanship in shaping support or opposition to
   specific behaviors. We observe a significant range of views about cancel
   culture and document connections to various political values. From our
   experiments, we find that partisanship is a potent driver of support for
   and understanding of cancel culture and that value-based framing has a
   weaker impact as compared to partisanship. Cancel culture provides an
   important case study of how Americans process conflicting norms and
   values, including free speech and political accountability, beyond the
   typical constraints of the formal political system.},

Abstract = {In this article, the UK's `safe and legal (humanitarian) routes' are
   evaluated by examining how they are positioned in the post-Brexit
   migration regime, and how these domestic provisions compare to those
   underwritten by international protections. The Hong Kong British
   Nationals (Overseas)-HK BN(O)s-and Ukraine visa schemes are an area of
   focus which, combined, account for the vast majority of those arriving
   in the UK for the purposes of humanitarian protections since Brexit.
   Despite being formally presented under the same banner, the schemes have
   significant differences in terms of eligibility criteria, costs, rights
   and entitlements. Moreover, on closer inspection, while they share an
   overarching policy vision informed by foreign policy priorities, these
   new provisions are underpinned by different genealogies and policy
   logics. While the HK BN(O) scheme is rooted in the tradition of ancestry
   visas and colonial entanglements and requires that potential
   beneficiaries pay for protections, the Ukrainian schemes are more
   closely aligned with recent refugee resettlement schemes and share with
   them the push towards greater involvement of private and community
   stakeholders in humanitarian protection.},

Title = {Polarization congruence and satisfaction with democracy: A multinational
   investigation},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {90},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The mass -elite congruence in politics is key to a healthy democracy.
   Existing research uses the match between citizens' ideological positions
   and those of political elites and parties to assess satisfaction with
   democracy over time and across countries. However, mass -elite
   ideological congruence does not necessarily guarantee mass -elite
   overlap in ideological polarization, the implications of which for
   democratic satisfaction are little known. Accordingly, our article
   examines the link between the mass -elite ideological polarization
   congruence and democratic satisfaction in a multinational context. We
   reason that when polarized electorates feel let down by their parties'
   depolarization, these ideologically polarized people would grow
   frustrated with the disconnected democratic system (seen as ineffective
   in meeting citizens' expectations and delivering meaningful political
   alternatives). Then, we find that electorates who do not consider their
   affiliated parties to be as ideologically polarized as themselves tend
   to be dissatisfied with the way democracy works in their countries. Our
   additional inquiries suggest that this democratic dissatisfaction
   parallels ambivalence in democratic commitment. We also find that the
   perception of no differences between parties, and affiliation with
   populist and losing parties amplifies these disappointed polarized
   electorates' dissatisfaction with democracy.},

Abstract = {The Tenth Amendment reads, ``The powers not delegated to the United
   States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are
   reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.{''} This
   provision is widely regarded as an essential component of the American
   system of federalism. However, the last phrase, ``or to the people,{''}
   is dismissed as a reference to the republican nature of the
   Constitution. I argue that ``the people{''} is at least in part
   reference to the primary governing institutions at the founding, which
   include the towns and their civil society progeny. This is true in the
   First, Second, and Fourth Amendments, where each reference to ``the
   people{''} is in the context of local, civil society institutions, not
   the people as a whole. The Tenth Amendment's reservations of power ``to
   the people{''} should be read, at least in part, in the context of these
   institutions.},

Abstract = {What is political and what is not? While conventional wisdom in public
   opinion research assumes a shared understanding of political matters,
   recent studies have challenged this assumption. In this article, we
   theorize and analyze how the prominence of abortion in the media affects
   whether or not citizens consider abortion a political issue. Leveraging
   the unexpected surge in media attention to abortion regulation in
   Spanish media during our survey fieldwork we implement an Unexpected
   Event During Survey Design. Our findings reveal that respondents
   interviewed after abortion gained salience in the media were 10\% points
   more likely to perceive abortion as a political matter.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade the problem of wage theft has burst onto the
   Australian policymaking scene, seemingly out of nowhere. Its meteoric
   rise, from a largely unrecognised issue to the broad public agenda, then
   onto the narrower governmental and decision agendas of state and federal
   governments, was a major feat in policy advocacy. It stands as a
   particularly outstanding example of the power of framing to change the
   salience and esteem of an issue. By tracing the journey of the wage
   theft issue through the different spheres of public and governmental
   attention, this research illuminates under-studied aspects of the
   re-framing and agenda-setting artforms and advances the study of
   advocacy group interventions in policy conflicts.},

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 28},
Abstract = {In political science, there are growing calls for scholarship to engage
   directly and equitably with communities and other research stakeholders.
   We build on, and advance, this emerging methodological literature by
   revisiting the conventional research process, and provide an adaptable
   guide scholars can use to develop and undertake a collaborative and
   civically engaged research project. We outline key considerations and
   decisions to be made at each step of the process when undertaking
   civically engaged research, provide a menu of options for how scholars
   can engage with research stakeholders at each step, and demonstrate
   these options with examples from real-world applications. In addition,

Abstract = {Brazil's electoral arena has long been characterized as devoid of
   identity politics. Recent analyses, however, have uncovered shifting
   racial subjectivities and effects of race and gender on electoral
   preferences. This paper leverages Brazil's 2018 election to reassess
   conventional wisdom and test whether recent findings derived from racial
   groups extend to other subordinate social groups in this context, namely
   women and sexual minorities. I test two hypotheses: (1) that higher
   levels of education correlate with greater perceptions of group-based
   discrimination, and (2) that perceptions of group-based discrimination
   explain within-group variation in support for Bolsonaro. Analysis of
   national survey data show that education correlates with group
   consciousness among subordinate groups, and that these individuals are
   more likely to oppose the far-right populist candidate. This article
   provides a more complete understanding of the electoral salience of
   identity in the Brazilian context, and provides evidence that insights
   derived from one marginalized group can extend to others.},

   first wave, I argue, was characterised by agenda-setting efforts to map
   the prospects of a distinctively critical approach to terrorism
   research. Second wave literature elaborated on this nascent project's
   scope, strengthening and broadening its empirical, conceptual, and
   methodological ambitions. More recent third wave work seeks to
   problematise the underpinning assumptions and commitments of earlier CTS
   literature, especially in relation to its engagement with race and
   colonialism. Mapping CTS' development in this way, I argue, offers three
   contributions to knowledge. First, it helps historicise CTS research by
   detailing the academic and wider contexts of its development. Second, it
   enables engagement with CTS' pluralism, foregrounding the importance of
   internal disagreements for its past and future trajectories. And, third,
   it enables new reflection on the political and normative stakes of
   differing approaches to, and aspirations for, critical terrorism
   research.},

Abstract = {What implications might rising animosity towards political out-partisans
   have for public health? Vaccination has a significant social aspect,
   protecting not only the vaccinated, but also those around them. While
   political ideology in the United States was an important driver of
   individuals' willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19, with those
   on the political right displaying greater hesitancy, we examine the role
   that political diversity has on vaccine uptake across US states and
   commuting zones. Using data from the Cooperative Election Study fielded
   on over 20,000 respondents in November 2021, and controlling for
   individual partisanship, we find that those who are political outliers
   in their community are significantly less likely to get vaccinated. By
   contrast, we find no equivalent negative effect for ethnic diversity. In
   sum, the impact of affective polarization is not limited to encounters
   between non-partisans; it can lead to decreased pro-social behavior that
   harms political friends and foes alike. Yet these behavioral effects
   depend on how individuals relate to their community's predominant
   political ideology.},

Abstract = {There is a large literature on the use of cases, hardly anything on
   examples. They are different: cases get analyzed, examples get deployed.
   Examples can perform clarifying, didactic, persuasive, universalizing,
   critical, and cogitative functions. These six functions all have their
   own logic, and a set of guidelines for how to perform each of them well
   is developed. However, compelling and persuasive examples can also
   mislead. Following Kahneman's distinction between system 1 (fast) and
   system 2 (slow) thinking, good examples both resonate in system 1 terms
   and invite system 2 scrutiny. The best examples are good in some aspect,
   flawed in interesting ways in others. A perfect example is a logical
   impossibility. The author's interest in convincing the reader and the
   discipline's interest in effective inquiry can diverge, a problem
   overcome if reason in inquiry is seen as essentially dialogical.},

   the European Union},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 11},
Abstract = {European regions implement up to 70\% of EU legislation, yet they are
   generally considered `objects' rather than `subjects' of European
   governance. This article proposes an original conceptual framework
   derived from practice theory in IR for the analysis of regional
   paradiplomacy in multilateral institutions. Through a case study of the
   Delegation of Flanders to the EU based on interviews with Flemish and
   Federal members of the Belgian Permanent Representation, this research
   contributes to the literature on paradiplomacy by critically examining
   the commonsense acceptance that sovereign authority can be delegated to
   substate actors while the unity of sovereign political representation
   must remain unchallenged. The analysis therefore shows that regional
   strategies of engagement with the EU are not only determined by formal
   institutions but are also shaped by taken for granted understandings of
   sovereignty which set the standards of competent diplomatic practice and
   inclusion for substate representatives.},

Abstract = {Through adoption of Video Data Analysis (VDA), this study analyses the
   2020-2021 revolutionary attempt in Belarus which featured the largest
   protests in the country's post-communist history. This study asks why
   state repression and violence broke out in some instances and
   interactions, but not in others? I analyse events that took place
   between activists and state forces through a sample of video data
   featuring 144 different cases including verbal interactions between
   protesters and authorities; fraternisation, and whether or not activists
   were able to strike a positive dialogue with police or security forces.
   These variables are statistically analysed with relation to whether
   authorities repressed protesters or if they successfully managed to put
   crowds under control. Results reveal that fraternisation and the
   establishment of a positive dialogue between protesters and state forces
   are negatively correlated with occurrences of state repression, which
   yields new insight into the micro-dynamics of repression and dissent.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the discourse on aesthetic citizenship
   within the context of recent policy shifts in Rwanda. Drawing on
   ethnographic research conducted in 2019, I examine two recent import
   bans of beauty products affecting second-hand fashion and skin-whitening
   cosmetics, which have had significant implications for the everyday
   aesthetic practices of Rwandan sex workers. While both initiatives were
   ostensibly progressive, with the rejection of donated clothing from the
   West and the prohibition of hazardous cosmetics, these policies have had
   profound consequences for those whose livelihoods rely on aesthetic
   labour as a means of social currency. Utilizing the concept of
   `aesthetic citizenship', I examine how post-genocide Rwanda has expanded
   its pursuit of creating a harmonious state to include regulations with
   aesthetic ramifications. Against this backdrop, I demonstrate that by
   challenging the state-upheld notions of appearance, my sex-worker
   interlocutors expanded their aesthetic belonging and consumption beyond
   Rwanda, navigating their aesthetic desires in its borderlands.},

Abstract = {The upper districts of Lorca (Murcia) are configured as a territory
   defined as `a frontier of appropriation', the result of the municipal
   political reorganisation of the rural space of Lorca, which was
   oversaturated with pig fattening farms for their relocation to the most
   unpopulated periphery. Furthermore, the expansive cycle of global pork
   production has enabled the expansion of large local producers, whose
   logic of valorisation required the search for peripheral territories in
   which to establish new meat production centres. However, the
   developments of intensive horticulture and industrial pig farming in the
   last decade have not led to a demographic renaissance in the upper
   districts of Lorca. In the case of industrial livestock investments,
   unlike horticulture, which is very labour-intensive, pig farms require
   very little labour. In this context, and as a central focus of this
   study, the logic of indiscriminate water appropriation is analysed. The
   large-scale pig farms in the upper districts of Lorca are generating a
   major problem in terms of the overexploitation of groundwater and
   springs to meet the water demands of the pig industry. There is also the
   problem of the questionable appropriation of water resources originally
   intended for human consumption. Given the scarcity of water in the area,
   the few existing freshwater reserves are at risk of constant
   appropriation. For this reason, planning and control over the use of
   water for the supply of industrial pig farms and the production of
   animal feed for livestock feeding is advocated. This socio-environmental
   issue contrasts with the work of neighbourhood groups trying to define
   the social value of nature against the logic of capitalist
   appropriation.},

Abstract = {How well do governments represent the societies they serve? A key aspect
   of this question concerns the extent to which leaders reflect the
   demographic features of the population they represent. To address this
   important issue in a systematic manner, we propose a unified approach
   for measuring descriptive representation. We apply this approach to
   newly collected data describing the ethnic, linguistic, religious, and
   gender identities of over fifty thousand leaders serving in 1,552
   political bodies across 156 countries. Strikingly, no country represents
   social groups in rough proportion to their share of the population. To
   explain this shortfall, we focus on compositional factors-the size of
   political bodies as well as the number and relative size of social
   groups. We investigate these factors using a simple model based on
   random sampling and the original data described above. Our analyses
   demonstrate that roughly half of the variability in descriptive
   representation is attributable to compositional factors.},

Abstract = {This article examines the public discussion that took place between 2014
   and 2015 on the human rights policy implemented in Argentina during the
   Kirchnerist governments. During the culmination of that political cycle,
   it was discussed whether the measures aimed at remembering and judging
   the crimes of the recent past had been adequate. The dispute was largely
   interpreted as the result of clashes between social actors with diverse
   interests, organised into power alliances within a framework of
   political polarization. Drawing on the concept of the deliberative scene
   proposed by Martin Plot and Claude Lefort's reflections on human rights
   in democracy, this work aims to consider the symbolic dimension of the
   debate to demonstrate how the constitutive tension between the universal
   and particular nature of human rights in modernity was expressed there.},

Abstract = {In 2021, the Danish Social Democratic government tabled a bill allowing
   asylum seekers to be transferred to another country to process claims
   and provide protection. Witnessing a Social Democratic government
   embracing this highly controversial idea, even though less than a
   handful of right-wing governments outside Europe had previously
   outsourced asylum, is puzzling. Policy diffusion theory is used to
   explain the underlying mechanism and analyse the justification
   strategies. In the face of public attention focused on the refugee
   protection crisis between 2014 and 2016, the Social Democrats embraced
   the idea of externalising asylum in order to be recognised as responsive
   problem solvers. Essentially, they employed three strategies to justify
   the policy and to mask its origin and its inconsistency with the party's
   ideology: (1) referring to policy advisors as the original source of the
   idea; (2) reframing externalisation as a humanitarian project; and (3)
   shifting the narrative about Social Democratic identity.},

Abstract = {During health crises, misinformation may spread rapidly on social media,
   leading to hesitancy towards health authorities. The COVID-19 pandemic
   prompted significant research on how communication from health
   authorities can effectively facilitate compliance with health-related
   behavioral advice such as distancing and vaccination. Far fewer studies
   have assessed whether and how public health communication can help
   citizens avoid the harmful consequences of exposure to COVID-19
   misinformation, including passing it on to others. In two experiments in
   Denmark during the pandemic, the effectiveness of a 3-minute and a
   15-second intervention from the Danish Health Authorities on social
   media was assessed, along with an accuracy nudge. The findings showed
   that the 3-minute intervention providing competences through concrete
   and actionable advice decreased sharing of COVID-19-related
   misinformation and boosted their sense of self-efficacy. These findings
   suggest that authorities can effectively invest in building citizens'
   competences in order to mitigate the spread of misinformation on social
   media.},

Abstract = {Radical right parties (RRPs) have gained representation in parliaments
   across Europe, but little is known about their impact on government
   policy. Even though RRPs tend to end up in opposition, they have
   considerable influence on policy making within coalition governments.
   One expectation is that coalition governments are tough on immigration
   to optimise voter support when being exposed to right-wing parties in
   parliament. Coalition negotiations temporarily reduce accountability and
   allow cabinets to adjust policy positions without bearing the costs
   associated with opportunistic behaviour. This argument is tested using
   novel data on pre-electoral policy positions and post-electoral
   immigration policies for coalition cabinets in 24 European democracies
   from 1980 to 2015. The findings reveal that governments shift to more
   restrictive immigration policies in face of RRPs. This article expands
   on prior research on the influence of the radical right by demonstrating
   its direct influence on coalition governments' joint immigration policy
   plans.},

Title = {Francophone materialist feminism, the missing link: Towards a Marxist
   feminism that accounts for the interlockedness of sex, race and class},
Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2, SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article discusses the Marxist-Feminist Theses III and VIII. It is
   based on the `French-speaking materialist feminist' theoretical
   perspective that has been developed at the end of the 1970s by Colette
   Guillaumin (with the concept of `sexage'), Monique Wittig (with the
   concept of `straight mind'), Nicole-Claude Mathieu, Christine Delphy and
   other members of the Nouvelles Questions Feministes journal's board. The
   article first presents this theorization, which is too unknown to many
   English-speaking theorists. It then shows how `French-speaking
   materialist feminist' theoretical perspective fully demonstrated that
   `sex' was a structural social relation as much as class is (Gender
   relations are relations of production). The article also analyses how
   this theoretical perspective enables us to pay a deep attention to the
   `race question'. Therefore, it appears as the missing link that can help
   bridging at least two important theoretical and political gaps: first,
   between Marxist feminism and lesbian theory, and, second, between Black
   feminism and Marxist feminism.},

Abstract = {How does the public judge counterterrorism policy? Using conjoint
   analysis, I study the effects of terrorism and counterterrorism
   engagement on public opinion in a democracy, where public opinion is
   expected to have a greater influence on policy outcomes in the future.
   While conjoint analysis is being employed more frequently in terrorism
   studies, this is the first use of a survey to study the features of
   counterterrorism policy, as well. I assess public opinion towards the
   appropriateness of counterterrorism policy in the United States in the
   aftermath of a hypothetical attack. Findings suggest that democratic
   publics prefer more restrained counterterrorism measures, including
   measures having a less direct impact on the general public (i.e.
   monitoring exercises) and demonstrating the government's commitment to
   democratic principles and institutions. However, these preferences can
   be reshaped by the features of an attack, including attack lethality and
   religious motivations. The findings from this study introduce another
   dimension to the conversation on provocation and have implications for
   successful counterterrorism policy in democracies.},

Abstract = {Viewing the relationship between politicians and voters as a
   principal-agent interaction afflicted by moral hazard, we examine how
   political careers are shaped by the incentives that voters provide
   incumbents to work in the public interest. When moral hazard binds, the
   optimal way for voters to hold politicians accountable is to provide
   re-election incentives that evolve dynamically over their careers in
   office. Under these incentives, first-term politicians are among the
   most electorally vulnerable and the hardest-working; politician effort
   rises with electoral vulnerability; electoral security increases
   following good performance and decreases following bad performance; and
   both effort and electoral vulnerability tend to decline with tenure. In
   extensions, we study limited voter commitment, voluntary retirement from
   politics, and adverse selection.},

Title = {Ambivalence across the globe: Investigating political ambivalence and
   its impact on vote switching in 52 multi-party systems},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {In many countries across the globe, the number of vote switchers is
   quite high. An under-researched dimension of this phenomenon is the
   impact of ambivalent political attitudes. Ambivalence describes the
   situation in which a person simultaneously has positive attitudes toward
   more than one political party or more than one political leader. Whilst
   the effects of party and leader ambivalence on vote switching have been
   investigated in the American political system, their application to
   multi-party systems is rare. This article aims to fill this gap. Before
   doing so, however, the article focuses on the development of party and
   leader ambivalent attitudes and system features of multi-party systems
   influencing ambivalence. For this research purpose, the article uses
   data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems covering 195
   elections in 52 multi-party systems between 1996 and 2020. The results,
   among others, demonstrate that ambivalence increases voters' probability
   to switch parties between elections.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the assumed trade-off between district compactness
   and Black representation in legislative districts in the American South.
   We analyze heuristically generated districts using current US
   demographics and historical congressional maps since the 1970s.
   Computations are performed using an iterative heuristic to find feasible
   solutions guided by multiple objectives. We find that while the
   trade-off has been strongly observed historically, it is possible to
   effectively address both goals simultaneously in most cases. We can
   demonstrate maps substantially superior to the present enacted maps on
   both dimensions in at least seven of the nine states analyzed.
   Nevertheless, the trade-off appears more necessary in states with larger
   and/or more heavily rural Black populations than in more urbanized
   states, where the drawing of compact Black-influence districts is
   easier.},

Abstract = {While women citizens have less political ambition than similarly
   situated men across a wide range of contexts, we know less about gender
   differences in progressive ambition - elected politicians' desire to
   achieve political leadership positions. This study analyzes leadership
   ambition among Swedish legislators. To understand the relationship
   between progressive ambition and the proportion of men and women in
   leadership positions, the political-institutional context is paramount.
   The gender-equal context of the Swedish Parliament allows us to
   investigate the relationship between progressive political ambition and
   informal rules, norms, and practices that promote the presence of women
   in political leadership. Drawing on interviews with nearly all top
   parliamentary leaders and party gatekeepers as well as a survey with
   MPs, we find that women leaders and MPs are less interested in political
   leadership in comparison to men. We describe the rules, norms, and
   practices that stipulate gender balance in decision-making in this
   context and show how gender-equitable informal institutions have
   contributed to creating gender balance in leadership. While such
   institutions have not closed the gender ambition gap at the individual
   level, they mitigate its consequences by incentivizing less ambitious
   women to accept leadership positions and prompting gatekeepers to search
   for and persuade competent women.},
